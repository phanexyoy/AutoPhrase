English Abstract
"The theories developed in economic sciences are based on a paradigm that does not seem realist at all – many authors actually agree on this. This paradigm is called homo oeconomicus, kind of ideal man lead by the principle of economic rationality. The point of this PhD. Is to analyse the construction of rationality and of the postulates that make appear. I propose a philosophical thought beginning with ontology, so as to do a deconstruction of the myths that economic sciences and also our society want us to believe as absolute truths. My reflection tries to point out that rationality is not what it pretends to be because the concept of rationality itself comes originally from an utilitarist construction, that have become through ages a systemic construction. Much more real than homo oeconomicus, homo systemicus keeps building and enduring the rationality of the system where he evolves. "

"Since the mid-1990s, we observe a global increase of current account imbalances. In 2007, before the climax of the financial crisis, they reached 2% of world GDP in absolute value. At the global level, the persistence of large current account imbalances is a threat to the macroeconomic and macrofinancial stability.
This thesis analyses this phenomenon of global imbalances by using two complementary approaches: equilibrium exchange rates models and stock-flow consistent models. These two approaches can be considered as complementary insofar as they analyze the same problem from a different point of view. Equilibrium exchange rate models and particularly the FEER approach introduced by Williamson (1994) try to calculate exchange rate variations needed to reach a sustainable current account balance. Stock-flow consistent models à la Godley-Lavoie (2007) seek to analyze adjustments in terms of level of output and exchange rate dynamics in a context of imbalances.
A return of large imbalances is not excluded. It appears that an international monetary cooperation aimed at preventing the return of large imbalances at the world and intra-European levels is a necessary condition to ensure global recovery."

"We study family businesses’ strategic management methods that promote sustainable and efficient internationalization. Based on four theoretical frameworks, sustainable economic value creation, strategic base, Uppsala’s sequential model, and organizational learning, we have ventured the following research hypothesis: the internationalization strategy boosts sustainable performance if family businesses’ strategic management methods rely on social and economic endogenous variables. Through a longitudinal intervention-research case, we have identified and measured its internationalization sustainable performance endogenous factors. Two main performance factors and two main sustainability factors provide competitive advantage for it: steering and controlling practices with three incremental functions (management, organization, and information), regular negotiation on “how to live together organizational agreement”, measurement of intangible and endogenous factors, and organization of experience-based learning."

"At the end of 2001, the scandal series was announced in the US context. Several scandals, especially the Eron failure, were revealed in the first stage by the media. The main purpose of this research is to study the impact of the new reform, in audit after Enron scandal, on auditor independence, audit comity and financial statement credibility. Three operational objectives have been treated in this study. First, we have analyzed the effects of Enron scandal on financial market reaction, auditor choice and auditor conservatism in the French context. Second, we have investigated the impact of the new reform on the auditor independence. Finally, we have examined the effect of audit committee on financial statement credibility after the adoption of the Bouton Report in 2002.The empirical results have shown that the presence of the Non-Big4 members in the legal audit process have minimized the negative effect of the reaction of the SBF 250. However, the perception of the foreign institutional investors has not changed significantly for the Big4 audit services. This auditor group (Big4) does not justify the production of the audit quality compared to other auditors in France. To restore confidence in the financial market, the French legislative authority  has created the H3C. The empirical results have revealed that the establishment of the H3C has ameliorated the auditor independence.  Hence, the announcement of the launch of H3C disciplinary activity after 2005 has not had a significant effect on auditor independence. In contrast, the appearance of the Bouton Report in 2002 and the reform related to the internal control depend on the audit committee characteristics (expertise and independence audit committee members)."

"It is common practice to judge third-party asset managers by looking at their financial performance relative to a benchmark portfolio. For this reason, they often choose to rely on internal risk-management models to control the downside risk of their portfolio relative to the benchmark. Moreover, an increasing number are adopting an incentive-based scheme, by charging an over-performance commission relative to the benchmark. Indeed, including this variable component in their global remuneration allows them to increase their revenue in case of over-performance without any penalty in the event of underperforming the benchmark. However, such practices have recently been at the heart of several polemics: the recent global financial crisis has uncovered some shortcomings in terms of internal risk control as well as excessive risk-taking and compensation levels of several financial players. Nevertheless, it appears that analyzing the impact of these practices remains a relatively new issue in continuous time-dynamic asset allocation theory. This thesis analyses in this theoretical framework the implications of these ""benchmarking"" practices on the asset manager's investment behavior. The first part examines the properties of the optimal dynamic strategy for the asset manager who is concerned by the difference of return between their portfolio and a fix or stochastic benchmark (over- or under-performance). Several asset manager types are considered, defined by different utility functions and different downside-risk constraints. In particular, the link between investment problems with aversion to under-performance and risk management constraints is shown. In the second part, the case of the asset manager who benefits from an incentive compensation scheme (variable asset management fees, over-performance bonuses or additional commission on asset under management), is investigated. We study how, depending on the choice of financial inventive structure and loss aversion level, the asset manager's strategy differs from that of the investor (or the strategy of the asset manager receiving no incentive remuneration). This study shows that the change in investment behavior of the asset manager can lead to both a reduction in the risk taken relative to the strategy without financial incentives or conversely an increase thereof. Finally we show that the existence of downside risk constraints, imposed on the asset manager or corresponding to their aversion for under-performance, can be beneficial to the investor mandating financial management."

"The purpose of this doctoral research is to analyse the conditions for the emergence of a CSR change process and knowledge transfer between an event stakeholders in the specific context of a convention centre and/or exhibition complex. By combining stakeholder theory, actor network theory and theoretical conceptualizations of knowledge transfer approach, our research proposes simultaneously to understand how each stakeholder is an actor in the event CSR process and the methods facilitating the construction and dissemination of CSRknowledge between them during the process. Our empirical methodology is based on a single case study carried out under a research contract (CIFRE) in Angers Expo Congrès, a company in charge of a convention centre and exhibition complex. In this context, we study two units of analysis: 1) the CSR approach of the organization and 2) the CSR approach of the tradeshow Sival. The results of our research identify and positionthe stakeholders in the event CSR change process. They also highlight the methods of collective action around the event CSR change process and the methods of inter-organizational knowledge transfer between stakeholders. This doctoral research jointly offers a real methodology for conducting CSR change involving event stakeholders and levers for action in order to facilitate the dissemination of CSR knowledge between them."
"The sea is an important means of international trade and transportation especially the transportation of petroleum products.in fact, the maritime transport of hydrocarbons may in many cases lead to the risk of oil pollution.Some areas like the Mediterranean Sea are exposed to traffic that threatens their very dense ecosystems. The Mediterranean is an important route for shipping and it is a place of transit.But shipping is a major cause of oil pollution in the Mediterranean Sea. This pollution may be of two types. It may be a incident pollution or operational pollution.Fortunately, the international community adopted legal rules for preventing oil pollution from ships. Because of its specificity, the Mediterranean will enjoy a special regulation.But unfortunately there is a current heterogeneity among Mediterranean countries concerning the implementation of relevant international and regional standards. This heterogeneity is attributed to two main reasons:First, the plan may contain regional and international legal shortcomings that reduce its effectiveness.Second, the Geopolitics of the Mediterranean Sea that lead to technological and economic inequality between the rich northern countries and poor southern countries."
"The use of fiscal policy as a stabilization and stimulus tool face a renewed interest from analyst and policy makers. After almost three decades where neo-Classical ideas were dominant, the recent financial crisis (late 2007) marked the reborn of Keynesian ideas on the importance of the State budget during economic downturns. This dissertation focuses on this issue and provides with stylized facts of fiscal policies in developing economies, and the main aim being to be able to say whether fiscal policy is an efficient political economy tool. Chapter 2 focuses on the issue of unanticipated fiscal measures on the economy. Using a structural VAR approach it investigates whether unanticipated budget measures can be used to stimulate a declining economy and what kind of challenges and threats this strategy imposes to public authorities. Chapter 3, relying on a gravity model, analyses the relationship between emerging and advanced economies fiscal aggregates and capital flows. It shows that there exists a “global” crowding out effect of investment towards emerging markets and, most important is that world economy is entering into a new paradigm. The last chapter from a panel of Sub-Saharan African and Latin American economies studies the issue of fiscal procyclicality. The empirical strategy has allowed us on a yearly basis to characterise the cyclical behaviour of fiscal policies in both set of countries. It has been shown that developing countries especially African ones are adopting progressively more prudent and disciplined policies."

"We analyse the effects of trade liberalization on the labor market of developing countries, with specific application to the Tunisian economy. We have structured our analysis around two axes. Initially, we studied the impact of trade on the labor market, and in a second step we studied the role of technological change induced by trade openness. Our research presented and discussed the theoretical and empirical literature and stylized facts on the subject. In our study of Tunisian case we estimated equations of total employment, employment of skilled labor, employment of unskilled labor, relative employment between skilled and unskilled labor and real wages. The key variables in these equations are those which measure the trade and those that measure the imported technology.The main results can be summarized as follows:- Trade openness has played an important role in changing the structure of employment in the Tunisian labor market.- The evolution of Tunisian labor market has the same trends as those observed in several developing countries (such as the countries of Latin America and East Asia).- These changes are manifested by an increase in employment of skilled labor relative to unskilled labor.- The descriptive statistics show that wage inequality increased in Tunisia.- Technological change biased towards skilled workers has been a factor in this evolution in Tunisia. The technology embodied in imported machinery and equipment raises relative employment of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers."
"This doctoral thesis addresses / exlpores the impact of management control on public organizations. The / my purpose is to question and evaluate the role of benchmarking in the management of public organizations and the ways in which this currently much used / popular / strategy / method can impact on the management / functioning of public organizations. This work offerts a comprehensive review of what has been written in the field. It also provides an analytical framework to assess the particularities / specific features of those organizations, those which make it difficult to implement the classic strategies / tools of management control, that is lolf, dashboard or reporting. A survey has been carried out with a sample group, of about forty people consisting of academics and other professionals: chartered accountants, financial auditors, legal counsels. The obtained results helped validate our general hypothesis that benchmarking does constitute a tool which can greatly improve the performance and management of public organizations."
"Ricardo is commonly celebrated for the theoretical achievements -his theory of growth which introduces us to the concept of trap of industrialism and his theory of comparative advantage that introduces us to the idea that technological differences across countries is the basis of international trade. What role Ricardo's theories have given to foreign direct investment (FDI) has remained a less explored issue. Thus, it is certainly relevant to study the implications of FDI and technology transfer for these theories. This thesis puts back the Ricardian growth bottleneck and the Ricardian trade approaches toward FDI and technology transfer at the forefront of analysis, builds and develops new theoretical settings and predictions. Moreover, this thesis provides new empirical applications.This thesis consists of four chapters. Two parts emerge. In the first part, we mainly revisit and reformulate the Japanese economic thought toward outward FDI, within the Ricardian context. We also implement econometric estimation to test the relevance and usefulness of this theoretical approach to outward FDI from catching-up countries. In the second part, we provide theoretical frameworks with empirical applications. We focus on the effects of technological inflows, especially via inward FDI, on the developing receiving countries and we develop new Ricardian approaches with empirical follow-up on the predictions.In chapter 1, we focus on outward FDI as an escape response to home country growth bottlenecks, which represents an important but under-explored phenomenon in the FDI literature. We review the push-factor approaches based on the pressure effect of the “Ricardian bottlenecks” to explain outward FDI. We reconsider Ozawa's macroeconomic theory of outward FDI, extend it and argue for a widespread applicability of FDI aimed at overcoming generalized “Ricardian bottlenecks”, especially, nowadays, natural resource-scarcity and the insatiable quest for energy, industrial raw materials and fuels. Our empirical findings confirm that outward FDI from emerging countries and transition economies (catching-up countries) acts as an escape response from “Ricardian bottlenecks” and strengthen the reasonableness, the usefulness and the empirical robustness of Ozawa's macroeconomic theory of FDI.In chapter 2, we reformulate Kojima's correspondence principle within Ricardian setting and point out that OFDI originating from the comparatively disadvantaged industry in the developed country and going to the comparatively advantaged industry in the developing country should follow the direction of absolute profit rates which is a reflection of the comparative advantage patterns.In chapter 3, we mainly focus, in the first section, on the welfare effect of North-South technology transfer within Ricardian setting. We single out the respective role of the relative size of both countries, the efficiency of the technology which is transferred, and the elasticity of substitution between the goods which are produced. In the second section of chapter 3, we explore what are the consequences of free technology transfer, licensing and FDI on the North-South welfare. We also provide an empirical analysis of the effect of licensing and foreign presence on the developing countries' terms of trade. We find that inward FDI and royalties' payment deteriorate the terms of trade of the developing and emerging countries.In chapter 4, we combine an extended continuum Ricardian trade setting which rank sophistication of exports by their technology intensity with the new advanced wave of empirical literature on export sophistication. Using data from the developing and emerging countries, we test the core theoretical prediction that foreign involvement and export penetration facilitate technological progress and upgrades export sophistication of a country by leading it to expand the range of goods that it produces toward sectors with rising productivity. In our next step, we bring the debate on the deterioration of the developing countries' terms of trade back into the limelight. Importantly, we show that despite the increase in their export sophistication, the developing countries continue to face terms of trade deterioration."
"The perfect rationality of investors, one of the foundations of theefficient market hypothesis, is increasingly being questioned. This has led to thedevelopment of behavioral finance. Market sentiment, which stems from it, is the focusof this study. Having first linked this concept to rationality and defined it, this studygoes on to present the most common ways of measuring market sentiment and assesstheir ability to anticipate market returns. Then, using two different studies, we do twothings (1) using mainly multi-Agent models and by modeling the impact of informationshocks on the distribution of returns, we empirically show how skewness and kurtosis inthe distribution of returns can be used as market sentiment indicators; (2) wedemonstrate that many standard sentiment indicators are processes affected by long- orshort-Term memory, making them invalid as contrarian indicators even though this ishow they are typically used."
"To improve the efficiency of the public sector, a decentralization process has been engaged in a large number of developing countries. This thesis, in four parts, analyzes various aspects of decentralization in developing countries. Part 1, which consists in a review of literature, studies the expected theoretical effects of decentralization, examines their relevance in the particular context of developing countries and, draws up a critical assessment of empirical studies evaluating the existence of such effects (chapter 1). Part 2 focuses on the relevance of an essential argument in favor of decentralization, largely ignored in studies on developing countries: the ""competition principle"". More precisely, we analyze the existence of strategic interactions between local governments in a context of weak fiscal resources (case of Benin, chapter 2) and in the absence of local democracy (case of China, chapter 3). Part 3 relates to the vertical relationship between the central government and local governments. In particular, we focus on the effect of central fiscal transfers on the level of local own-Revenue in Benin (chapter 4) and on the determinants of the allocation of fiscal transfers between local governments in Senegal (chapter 5). Finally, in part 4, we determine the average and distributional impacts of decentralization on the access to basic services by local population (chapter 6)."

"Access to basic education as well as quality and equity of education systems in developing countries are still crucial issues, with millions of children currently unable to exercise their right to complete their basic education. Schooling of the poorest thus remains a central priority, one in which we believe that economics of education has a central role to play. By means of five essays, this thesis addresses issues related to international aid to education, public or private education, parental choices, secondary schools‟ efficiency and teacher satisfaction. With a macroeconomic perspective, Chapter 1 analyzes the effectiveness of international aid as an instrument to reach universal primary education while Chapter 2 seeks to explain the differences in distribution of students between public and private education in the world. The remainder of this thesis is based upon an original national survey conducted in the secondary schools of Madagascar, a country marrying extensive household poverty with a strong presence and a wide variety of private educational opportunities. Chapter 3 discusses the way in which parents choose a secondary school for their children and its effects on social stratification. Chapter 4 examines the efficiency of public and private secondary schools and its determinants. Lastly, Chapter 5 examines the factors influencing satisfaction, accumulation of jobs and absenteeism of secondary schools teachers."
"This thesis examines the different facets of the liquidity risk and aims to analyse their essential role in the stability of the financial system. In the theoretical part of the thesis, we treat liquidity risk through bank runs. Gradually, we introduce the interbank market as a liquidity insurance mechanism between banks. However, when there is an overall shortage of liquidity, this market tends to encourage the spread of liquidity crises from bank to bank which can lead to a systemic financial crisis. We study the literature on risk contagion by interbank links and through asset price effects. The applied part of the thesis aims to test the validity of hypotheses and insights presented in the theoretical framework. The goal is to betterunderstand the mechanism of liquidity risk and the forces of interaction between balance sheet effects that can lead to the transformation of liquidity risk into systemic risk caused by counterparty risk or the revaluation of tradable assets at market prices. In the first numerical application, we propose to evaluate the risk of contagion by interbank linkages in a context where banks borrow on the interbank market and/or at the central bank if necessary. The second simulation is dedicated to contagion through asset price effects, considering that the banks must sell assets on the market to meet their liquidity shortfall. If mark-to-market accounting is applied, the effects of the douwnturn in prices appear immediately and cause a spontaneous reaction from stakeholders."
"Since the early eighties, the liberalization of the world economy has led to a rapid evolution of the FDI flows essentially to the developing countries. This growth is the result of a structural change of the economic activity towards an international vertical specialization. Consequently, a new principle of analysis has emerged to arbitrate between the FDI and the international outsourcing.Our work is interested in the case of Tunisia and examines the evolution of the FDI inflows after the signing of the partnership agreement with the EU in 1995. This agreement represents a landmark in the liberalization process of the Tunisian economy meant to strengthen the traditional economic determinants.Our empirical study of the inflows between 1992 and 2008 for the 58 countries originating in the foreign investment in Tunisia shows that these investments have concentrated mainly on the sector of energy and on the textile and clothing industry. The main motivation of the foreign investors remains the search for cheap labour in a logical international division of labour. Furthermore, apart from some privatization operations generating important flows and concentrated in telecommunications and cement, the process of liberalization of the economic activity didn't have the expected effects on the incoming FDI flows."
"This thesis deals with the externalization of change management knowledge in the National French Railways Company for sharing (elicitation, modelling and formalization). We have chosen to consider not only the «implicit» dimension of this know-how (which is not stated) but also its ""pre-reflective"" dimension (which is not immediately conscious for the subject who uses it). This approach has led us to investigate a ""pre-reflective knowledge engineering"". Currently, most knowledge management researchers and practitioners prefer to solve the problem of tacit sharing by socialization rather than by externalization. However there has been some research done on eliciting knowledge which could be applied to knowledge management. More precisely, we have focused on the contributions of the “explicitation interview” (Vermersch) to knowledge management problems. Our research went through the following stages: state of the art in change management, knowledge management and pre-reflective knowledge, description of the system constituted by the change management knowledge at the SNCF, design of an ontology in order to represent this explicit, implicit and pre-reflective knowledge through conceptual graphs, design and development of a server for this knowledge sharing and finally, the elicitation and formalization  of the know-how which consists in leading participative working parties. Methodologically, this study has enabled us to develop on the one hand a method for building an ontology starting from pre-reflective knowledge, on the other hand an adaptation of the explicitation interview for the knowledge management domain"
"Sine the 70's, the economic literature on financial systems has developed a series of concepts as ""credit rationing"", ""informational asymmetries"" and ""market failures"" in order to better explain financial systems' real functioning. Giving all transformations lived by financial systems in the last decades, market failures and rationing entries need to be actualized in order to better understand those systems. Actualizing market failures debate means, symmetrically, to actualize the debate about public policies on financial systems. So, the main issue of this theses can be exposed : how to define, design and calibrate economic policies in heterogeneous and constantly evolving financial systems ?Main development issues behind this question are presented in the first chapter. This chapter is important in order to understand the heterogeneity of rationing mechanisms in developing countries' financial systems.In the second chapter, we explore this heterogeneity of rationing mechanisms, analyzing Morocco's financial system. Spatial dimensions of credit rationing are introduced in chapter three in order to understand Micro Finance Institutions' location in Bolivia. This actualized lecture of credit rationing phenoma es useful for sesigning better and calibrated policies in financial systems. In chapter four and five, we analyze modern financial policies, especially through the study of National Development Banks' performance in Latin America."
"This thesis is based on three essays focused on analysis of the excess liquidity in the CEMAC countries. The first one identifies the determinants of excess liquidity in developing countries by studying the case of CEMAC member countries from 1985 to 2002. The GMM estimator used has shown that the excess liquidity in Central Africa derived from both the prudence of commercial banks and exogenous factors. The precaution of Commercial Banks can be explained by the financial crisis in 1980s, the restructuring of the banking system, the instability of deposits and a very risky economic environment. The increasing in oil prices fueling excess reserves due to the low absorption capacity of countries in the region. In the second essay, it was discussed the transmission channels in Central Africa. The VAR model used has shown that the interest rate channel is the lowest. This is exactly the lack of a financial market that does not allow ensuring the function of the recycling of liquidity and the transmission of mone ary policy. At the last essay, it was developed a forecasting model of inflation in Chad which is member of CEMAC countries. BVAR models have been shown in Chad to be more effective than traditional tools (AR, ARIMA and VAR). A sensitivity analysis undertaken by the Bayesian approach indicates that the excess liquidity would exert inflationary pressures."

"Private short-stay clinics are confronted with increasing economic constraints, to which they are trying to adapt, due to stronger competition and a new system of pricing. This research identifies which are the organizational determinents and financial performance strategies of private clinics.  A review of French and foreign literature pertaining to the performance of these health establishments revealed the presence of numerous determinents of the financial performance. To identify the factors influencing the private clinics, a statistical study was performed on 463 French short-term clinics, where the relevent data was available.  The results of these statistics indicated that the financial performance of these clinics, as measured by financial scores and ratios, underwent an influential impact in the short and long term. The productivity of the paid employees, the volume of activity, the presence of a well-defined and effective strategic project, so that the quality of the care given, as measured by the results of these clinics on different steps towards improvement on the quality of care, are the factors which presented a strong impact on the financial performance."
"This thesis deals with the issue of households’ participation to a local public service provision, offering an economic analysis of the strategies developed by local governments in France to involve households in waste reduction practices and recycling.In a first part, we present the policy instruments available to local governments in the French context to foster the adoption by households of waste management practices more respectful of the environment. Environmental economics are used here to build aconceptual framework to understand local governments’ waste management policy. On this basis, a typology of the measures undertaken by local governments to involve households in waste reduction practices and recycling is developed. We identify four distinct strategies,as specific combinations of the measures implemented by local governments.In the second part, we assess the determinants of local governments’ choices with regard to their waste management strategy and the ability of each strategy to promote recycling effort by households. Drawing on insights from public economics and economicsof household waste management, a microeconomic model is developed to simultaneously analyze local governments and households waste management decisions. Theoretical propositions derived from the model are then empirically tested. The results highlight their mportance for local governments of taking into account households’ characteristics in the definition of their waste management strategy. We also show that households’ recycling effort rises when local governments implement measures directly constraining household waste production."
"In actual economic situation an increasing number of firms are facing economic and financial difficulties which can, in certain cases, drive to failure. In principle, difficulties do not happen suddenly, in effect, before a firm is declared bankrupt, it is confronted to financial difficulties of growing seriousness: default in payment of a debt, temporary insolvency, scarceness of liquidity, etc. Identifying the causes of the failure is not obvious, since one can not exhaustively enumerate the factors that cause it. The causes are multiple and overlapping compromise even more the company's survival. The importance of this phenomenon and its impact on the overall economy justifies the need to understand, explain it by analyzing the causes and origins The aim of our study is to classify firms in trouble according to their degree of viability and to understand the causes of the deterioration of their situation. We will do a comparison between three models (linear differential Analysis, the model Logit and decline PLS) what will allow us from the rates of good classification acquired, to choose the best model while specifying origin and reasons of these faults."
"In the first essay, we study Cournot oligopoly TU-games in gamma-characteristic function form. First, we prove that if any individual profit function is concave, such games are balanced. Then, when the individual cost functions are linear, we provide a solution in the core, called NP(Nash Prorata) value. The second essay considers Cournot oligopoly interval game in gamma-set function form. The first (second) result states that the interval (standard) core is non empty if and only if the Cournot oligopoly TU-game associated with the best (worst) worth of every coalition in its worth interval admits a non-empty core. In the thirdessay, we focus on Stackelberg oligopoly TU-games in gamma-characteristic function form. First, we prove that the core is equal to the set of imputations. Th en, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition, depending on the heterogeneity of firms' marginal costs, under which the core is non-empty. In the fourth essay, we show that Bertrand oligopoly TU-games inalpha and beta-characteristic function forms are convex. Then, we prove that the equal division solution is in the core of Bertrand oligopoly TU-games in gamma-characteristic function form and we give a sufficient condition under which such games are convex. The fifth essay studies the case where the marginal costs are distinct. If the intercept of demand is sufficiently small then games in _beta-characteristic function form are totally balanced. Otherwise, these games are convex."
"The purpose of this thesis is ti determining the effects of technological innovations diffusion on employment in Tunisia. First, the empirical approaches adopted show that, in the short run, the effects on employment are positive, but they are negative in medium and long runs. If this result is not specific to the reference sample used in this research and to investigated period, the Tunisian context seems to contradict the theoretical predictions. This result could affirm the fact that Tunisian economy remains a passive consumer and a small producer of technological innovations. This investigates the absorptive capacity of the Tunisian industry and the efficiency of learning process. The short-run positive effect, on the other hand, is explained by the complementary of capital and labor. Then, we are interested to the effect of technological innovations diffusion on industry's labour demand by skill. The econometric research suggests the existence of skill-biased technical change that favour the industries demand of managers. These later are supposed the most skilled-labour. In addition to this effect, they complement the capital rather the manual workers, who are supposed unskilled-labour. We show also a strong correlation between the job flows (creations, destructions) and the different channels of technological diffusion. Finally, we attempted to evaluate the effective role of technological innovation diffusion in addition to local industrial structure (diversity, specialization and competition) in the regional development of employment. The econometric research shows that competitive environment (Porter externalities) are the diversity of industrial activities (Jacobs's externalities) are favorable to local development. The result also prove that technological innovation may be having a positive global effect on regional employment."
"The presentation of requirements of profitability, social responsibility and their articulation in the CEO letters: Carrefour group case. Our research aims to analyze how leaders -in the name of their company- present and articulate, in their speeches, the two major requirements of today's capitalism: On the one hand, the requirement of maximizing shareholder value -driven by institutional investors through a ""financial capitalism""- to public companies and their leaders seem to win the French model of corporate governance. On the other hand, the requirement for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) -originated by the actors of civil society- is forcing companies and their leaders to be concerned about social and environmental dimensions. In this perspective, an empirical study was conducted on the messages of the Annual and Sustainability Reports of Carrefour Group over the period 1993-2007. It was possible to observe a progressive domination of the criteria of financial capitalism in the speeches of CEOs and strengthen the arguments of the concomitance of the emergence of the discourse of maximizing shareholder value and CSR and the poor articulation of two discourses"
"The aim of this Ph.D. Dissertation is to explain the location of the French gastronomyby the mean of the ""Gastronomic District"" concept, which is a special typeof industrial and / or cultural cluster. After building the concept of ""GastronomicDistrict"", we study two main forms.We identify two types of gastronomic districts in France, by source of supply ofgastronomic inputs - and consequently the type of heritage(s) used - : ""the gastronomicdistrict based on a regional and common gastronomic heritage"" symbolisedby the model of Lyon, and ""the gastronomic district based on an aristocratic gastronomicheritage, derived from the Court cuisine and organized by the local culturalheritage"" illustrated by the Parisian model. The origin ofraw materials needed forChefs induced a different relationship with the local heritage and a different organizationwithin the district...The purpose of this work is to produce an analysis of two French gastronomicdistricts, which can then be used for the study of other districts and to identifyother types of gastronomic districts."
"The Framework Programs (FPs) are the European Union’s (EU’s) main tools for the promotion of research and innovation within the European territory. They both improve the competitiveness of European firms and promote the emergence of a European Research Area (ERA). Complex networks arise from the collaborations formed between the actors of research and innovation, through projects funded by the FPs. The objective of this thesis is first of all to show how network analysis provides an interesting perspective for a better understanding of FPs and then to assess the impact of innovation policies within the EU. This analysis will then enable an examination of the structural properties of collaborations formed under the FPs as well as a report on the determinants of collaborations within these programs. The work in this thesis focuses upon the Information Society Technology (IST) of the 6th FP. Two technological fields are used : Telecommunication and Electronics-Microelectronics.Initially, we study the networks formed by collaborations between two agents from selected technological fields and the aggregated network formed by these two fields of research. We study the general properties of these networks. We aim to verify whether or not these networks have the properties of “small-world networks”. This type of network is known in the literature to foster innovation networks. We also observe the characteristics of their evolution over time. Then, we study the agents which compose the networks and particularly we highlight the existence of “hubs”. We select the appropriate indicatorsand, where necessary, we develop new indicators as the strengthened degree for example. We conduct the analysis at both macroeconomic and microeconomic level. Finally, we construct networks which are aggregated at the regional level in order to study regional collaborations. Thus, it is possible to observe whether the FPs permit harmonious development within the EU and involve the construction of an ERA. In a second part, we study the determinants which may induce both agents to collaborate. We are particularly interested in agents who have experience in FPs. We study the role played by the traditional determinants as the means for R&D, geographical proximity,. In addition, we emphasize the role played by previous networks in collaboration choices. We study both the existence of collaboration between two agents and the intensity of these collaborations. Finally, in order to extend the analysis of the FPs, we study the formation of triads and particularly we show the existence of the phenomenon of “triadic closure”."
"The present study focuses on the long absenteeism for health reason at non medicalhospital staff. Two types of non ordinary sick leave are aimed : the C.L.M. and C.L.D. (rulingson salary insurance). Those indeed constitute a challenge of management by thedisorganizations and the costs, mainly hidden, which they cause. They represent also a stakein social health, because of the morbidity they express.In order to characterize and measure them, this work takes as a starting point theorganizations socio-Economic approach (I.S.E.O.R., Lyon). We particularly try to carry out aplural diagnosis (social, organizational and financial). The ambition is threefold. It acts 1) tomake become aware of the scale of the damages (mirror effect for the direction); 2) tocontribute to the development of a theoretical and practical reference frame (widenedevaluation of the absences); 3) to contribute to the promotion of good and really presenteeim(human resources recommendations).The various investigations are done on three publicregional hospitals of voluntarily different size (C.H.U., C.H., H.L. – in the center of France).Each time the results let appear alarming profiles, operations, spending and lived. They giveevidence to a failure in organisational and managerial human resources. These negativereturns also attest an extension possibility of the socio-Economics’ analysis (to the extendedsickness absences in structures of care). They finally allows to identify some tracks ofintervention, sometimes transverse (proximity in the procedures), sometimes specific(peculiarities of the structure)."
"Traffic management is facing the new issues of the sustainable development concept. The objective is not only to guarantee acceptable travels times over the networks anymore. Energy consumption as well as associated greenhouse gaz and pollutant emissions must be reduced for a better quality of life for current and future generations. Standards in road safety have also been reinforced and aim at cutting off the number of accident fatalities. Thus, traffic operators use the most innovating strategies. Nevertheless, if decision-makers have greater possibilities to implement their programmes, they also are committed to assess their performance at different stages. This doctoral thesis analyses the new strategies in motorway network management by identifying their respective domains of application as well as their potential and real impacts. Limitations of existing a priori and a posteriori evaluation methods are highlighted and a new approach is proposed. It associates the three main criteria of sustainable mobility to one concept: the level of service, which is widely used by network operators. The methodology is validated on several operations. Besides, based on results obtained from the various lane management operations implemented all accross Europe, the thesis proposes a tool to help in choosing the appropriate strategy according to the motorway layout and congestion level. The tool is presented in the form of a catalog of typical cases for the Ile-de-France motorway network. The new evaluation approach proposed in this thesis may be easily integrated in the available traffic simulation tools. Hence, the impacts of a traffic management operation on congestion, safety and the environment may be obtained as output from those simulators in the framewok of an a priori evaluation. This integration is also possible in the traffic management center systems, for a posteriori evaluations. Besides, the thesis identifies potential subjects for future research. Firstly, accident severity could be considered in the proposed evaluation approach, which takes into account all injury accidents at once by now, due to a lack of data. Likewise, only four manged lane strategies are included in the catalog, which could be extended to all the existing traffic management operations through the same methodology described in the thesis"
"The overall aim of this thesis was to create a decision support system that identifies discrepancies in ship behavior. The thesis was a part of the SECMAR project that aimed to improve security at the Marseilles harbor by the creation of decision support system for port staff. For this purpose, we developed a recognition behavior system consisting of two complementary sub-systems.The first system was based on the probabilistic Hidden Markov model approach and deals with nominal behavior of large to medium size commercial ships showing regular and recurrent behavior. The second system was based on the reactive synchronous language Esterel and concerns aggressive and transgressive behavior of small ships that may navigate freely in the harbor. Real-time evaluations showed that the proposed decision support system efficiently captured and evaluated ship behaviors. The promising results of the system and its diversity in origin makes it suitable for applications in other harbors as well as other environment such as airports."
"In the literature, debate around environmental federalism is lasting and inconclusive. China has followed the global tendency of decentralization and has adopted a de facto environmental federalism. In this broad and diverse country, local knowledge and expertise is necessary to develop proper solutions for many environmental problems with local and regional nature. However, despite the adopted de facto environmental federalism, dramatic environmental crises and policy failures widespread in China. In particular, more recently, this country has seen arise many problems predicted by the opponents of decentralization. It appears that, contrary to the fiscal decentralization which has been a “helping hand” in resource mobilization and economic growth at the sub-National level, the decentralization of environmental policy implementation has rather been a “grabbing hand” in environmental management. With the purpose of providing a better and detailed understanding of the de facto environmental federalism in China, this thesis follows the different critics in the literature and test empirically for each of them in the Chinese-Specific context. In summary, empirical results found in this thesis support the existence of problems related to environmental externality, strategic interaction and politically incentivized environment-Sacrificing behaviors. Moreover, the current fiscal decentralization is likely to strengthen the capital-Competition driven inter-Provincial interaction; fiscal imbalance is more environmentally detrimental in poor provinces. These findings call for a “new environmental federalism” and a reform of incentives, in order to transform the Chinese de facto environmental federalism from a “grabbing hand” to a “helping hand” for better environmental governance."

"Transportation sector is confronted to the challenge of sustainable mobility. In spite of its importance in the social and economic views, its durability is challenged by its reliance on a fossil energy (oil) and its greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth’s atmosphere. Public policies call for optimizing transport sector, notably by using Information and communications technologies (ICT) in order to rationalize human’s journeys. This study proposes to verify if the use of these technologies can lead to more sustainable mobility by optimizing transports. That’s why we will discuss the case of the relationship between mobile phone positioning applications and travel. A qualitative study has been conducted based on 30 interviews on key actors. The results show that the uses of these applications do not actually optimise travel, but rather increase its environmental cost, particularly leading to more travel and energy consumption. Furthermore, the ability of these applications to modify travel behavior is highly overestimated. Consequently, mobile positioning applications fall short of supporting sustainable mobility."
"IIndonesian cities such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan and Semarang have a rapid development level. These cities concentrate many economic activities and employments. Transport infrastructure do not support this rapid economic development and labor market. Research on mobility and accessibility of labor market in Indonesian cities is quite few. In this research, we would like to show the characteristic of mobility and labor market in Indonesia in order to enrich the knowledge of this domain especially for developing country case"
"The objective of this doctoral research is to study Internet-based disclosure practices in France. First, we examine the impact of corporate governance on Internet-based disclosure strategy. The results indicate that firms with more dispersed ownership disclose more information on the Internet; companies with a two-tier board system disseminate less information on their website than firms with a one-tier board; for companies in the one-tier system, we found that the level of Internet-based disclosure is negatively related to CEO-Chairman duality. Moreover, the creation of monitoring committees inside the board can improve online information transparency. Second, we examine the economic impact of Internet-based disclosure in the French capital market. The results show a negative relation between the amount of discretionary information published via Internet and the relative spread. We also observe that enhanced Internet-based disclosure can reduce the stock's volatility. These results indicate that quoted companies can reduce information asymmetry and investor uncertainty by enhancing information transparency via Internet. Third, we study the tone of financial announcements in order to complete our analysis of discretionary disclosure. Results from a content analysis show that the level of optimism in the tone of a financial announcement can be an indicator of future firm performance. Moreover, framing the financial announcement in a more optimistic angle causes investors to think positively about the future outlook of a firm."
"In the context of the prediction of coated materials durability submitted to mechanical loadings, we have developed a numerical model based on damage mechanics able to describe oxide layer fracture for Ni/NiO and Zr/ZrO2 systems (the periodic crack pattern in the oxide layer and the debonding of the oxide layer). A finite element model combining strong discontinuity approach and interface elements has been used. To take into account the initial defects in the material, we consider randomly distributed limit stress in the oxide layer. A statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the “mean inter-crack distance” of the periodic crack pattern in the oxide layer. The developed model is based on an experimental analysis of the oxide layer fracture phenomenon. This analysis focuses on the observation of the oxide layer damage evolution with different levels of mechanical loadings. These observations are performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which allows to determine the “mean inter-crack distance” and by correlation with the numerical results, the model parameters (the limit stress of the metal/oxide interface, the crack energy of the periodic cracks) have been identified and our numerical approach has been validated.

"The abdominal aortic aneurysm is a vascular disease characterized by a degradation of the extracellular matrix. It is accompanied by a decrease of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Previous work performed in the laboratory showed that the gingival fibroblast (GF) inhibits the degradation of elastic fibers in an ex vivo artery culture model. This effect is linked to the stimulation of the synthesis of TIMP-1 by SMCs of the aortic wall by gingival fibroblast (Gogly, 2007). In order to contribute to the development of a cell therapy with GFs, it is important to know whether GFs also have a protective effect on the arterial wall cells. We first showed that the presence of GFs in co-culture with fragments of aorta, lead to a decrease of the number of apoptotic cells in the aortic wall. The treatment of aorta segments with GFs conditioned medium gave similar results. To study the mechanisms of this anti-apoptotic effect, we used cells in monolayer (a line of human fibroblast Wi26 and HUVEC). The GFs inhibit the activity of caspases 3 and 9. The inhibition of the caspase 9 activity showed that GFs modulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. This is confirmed by studies of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and the release of cytochrome c. The analysis of pro- (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Hsp27) protein expression also showed an increase of the expression of Bcl-2 and an inhibition of Bax. Next, we showed that overexpression of Bcl-2 by the GFs conditioned medium go through the FAK/Pi3K signaling pathway and the induction of phosphorylation of MAP kinase Erk1 / 2. Finally, among the various factors secreted by the GFs, we analysed the effects of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 using blocking antibodies. The results showed an inhibition of the expression of Bcl-2 by anti-TIMP-1 and an inhibition of the expression of Bcl-2 accompanied by a decrease of the phosphorylation of Erk1 / 2 by the antibody anti-TGF-beta1. Therefore the TIMP-1 and the TGF-beta1 contribute, at least partially, to the anti-apoptotic effects of GFs. Thus, this research permits to have a better understanding of the mechanisms of these anti-apoptotic effects of GFs and contributes to the development of a new cell therapy strategy based on GFs. "
"Product placement is becoming an increasingly significant communication tool in cultural products. Product placement is traditionally studied in the field of films, but music concerts are also an attractive medium. Indeed, the crisis of the music industry leads the artists to find another way to other sources of financing. Our research takes into account the influence of this technique in connection with congruence, personality endorsement and how the audience copes when they recognize the persuasion attempt. Moreover, we considered the effect of product placement on brand image, because it is one of the most important goals according to the firms which want to use the technique of product placement. We aim to better understand the ins and outs of product placements in music concerts thanks to three studies. The first one is qualitative. We interviewed various artists, companies which deal with product placement, concert music producers and a legwoman. The second one is quantitative, and compares 4 types of product placements thanks to an in situ study. The last one is also quantitative and is linked with the previous study. It aims to focus on interactive product placement in which the interaction between the artist and the audience becomes the medium for new forms of product placement. We are not able to demonstrate significant results of interactive product placement on brand image but there is a trend showing that interactive product placement leads to a better brand image compared with the other kinds of placements. Subsequently, we underline the complex role of congruence. Moreover when the audience identifies the persuasion attempt, it does not influence negatively the brand image contrary to what the Persuasion Knowledge Model indicates. In return, product placement efficiency on brand image is linked with endorsement. Indeed the attitude towards the artist has a positive influence on brand image. The research concerning product placements in music concerts is still in its early stages but this kind of sponsorship offers promising opportunities for brands and artists alike."
"Personal relationship plays an important role in creating and developing customer relationship. This important role has been confirmed in the service field and especially in Asian culture. “Renqing” (the norme of reciprocity in Asian context) has a critical role in creating and maintaining personal relationship. “Renqing” is considered a stable mechanism and helps to harmonize personal relationships in Asian societies based on favor exchange and reciprocal obligation. This variable is included in our study in the relationship between frontline employees and customers in the context of Vietnamese banking service. With the dyadic approach, we studied the “renqing” variable of frontline employees and customers in their relationship and their impacts on the relationship quality. “Renqing” of frontline employees have an effect on the employees’ adaptive behavior in service delivery. In terms of customers, “renqing” for frontline employees is a variable affecting interpersonal trust and through this trust it affects the quality of the relationship between customers and the bank.  Finally, with the dyadic approach, our research confirms the suggestions on the effects of “renqing” of employees on “renqing” of customers and the indirect effect of employees’ “renqing” on customers’ trust through the two mediator variables: “renqing” of customers and adaptive behavior. Our research allows us to confirm the role of “renqing” variable in the customer relationship model in the Vietnamese context. Indeed, the study with the dyadic approach to “renqing” variable enables us to understand the way reciprocity between frontline employees and customers strengthens customer relationship in the context of an Asian country."
"The economie literature largely defends the existence of financial supports to private R&D owing to the numerous externalities and distortions that lead firms to underinvest in R&D. The proliferation of these supports at different territorial levels and the recent emergence of more constrasting arguments concerning their rationale underline an increasing need for the analysis of these policies and the ir territorial impacts. The purpose of this PhD thesis is to provide new elements regarding the rationale, the effects and the effectiveness of financial supports to private R&D.The first chapter proposes a discussion on the ratio na le of financial supports to business R&D following the endogenous growth literature and its refinements including a geographical dimension. Divergences in the theoretical and empirical approaches concerning the origins and the magnitude of the private underinvestment in R&D eventually leads to the hypothesis of a limited and specifie private underinvestment in R&D.Chapters 2 and 3 provide theoretical analyses of the spatial and dynamics effects of a centralized subsidy policy for R&D. The results show that this policy strengthens economie growth, reduces territorial inequalities while improving the global welfare. The benefits of such policy are not only dependent on the chosen assumption about returns to R&D but more importantly on its design in terms of funding and geographical allocation of subsidies.Chapter 4 provides an empirical analysis of the capacity of financial supports to R&D to stimulate private investment in R&D from a panel of OECD countries.The results indicate a greater sensitivity of private investment in R&D to indirect supports (fiscal incentives) than to direct supports (grants and subsidies) and suggest the existence of substitution effects between these two forms of support."
"Sustainable mobility development requires the optimization of existing transportation infrastructure. In particular, ubiquitous traffic information systems have the potential to optimize the use of the transportation network. The system must provide accurate and reliable traffic information in real-time to optimize mobility choices. Successful implementations are also valuable tools for traffic management agencies. The thesis studies how the emergence of Internet services and location based services on mobile devices enable the development of novel Intelligent Transportation Systems which estimate and broadcast traffic conditions in arterial networks. Sparsely sampled probe data is the main source of arterial traffic data with the prospect of broad coverage in the near future. The small number of vehicles that report their position at a given time and the low sampling frequency require specific models and algorithms to extract valuable information from the available data. On the one hand, the variability of traffic conditions in urban networks, caused mainly by the presence of traffic lights, motivates a statistical approach of arterial traffic dynamics. On the other hand, an accurate modeling of the physics of arterial traffic from hydrodynamic theory (formation and dissolution of horizontal queues) ensures the physical validity of the model. The thesis proposes to integrate the dynamical model of arterial traffic in a statistical framework to integrate noisy measurements from probe vehicle data and estimate physical parameters, which characterize the traffic dynamics. In particular, the thesis derives and estimates the probability distributions of vehicle location and of travel time between arbitrary locations. The thesis leverages the data and the infrastructure developed by the Mobile Millennium project at the University of California, Berkeley to validate the models and algorithms. The results underline the importance to design statistical models for sparsely sampled probe vehicle data in order to develop the next generation of operation large-scale traffic information systems"
"This thesis addresses the question of the dynamics of foreign industrial R&D centres.Just as Ronstadt (1978), Asakawa (2001) and Asakawa & Som (2008) did before us, we notice thatthe mission and the position of the R&D centres in their internal innovation network are changing over time. We have identified four different phases in these dynamics: 1/ the setting up of the centre, 2/ the double phase during which the centre builds up its own identity, thanks to its integration into its internal innovation network and the creation of its external innovation network, 3/ its maturity.One of the key questions was then to understand how the centre was able to rise from its first phase, during which it did not have its own identity, to its maturity phase, where it has its own speciality and is recognized as one of the key elements of its internal innovation network. In order to answer this question, we have identified the types of relationships between the centre, its internal innovation network and its local environment during each phase of its dynamics. We used the academic literature on clusters which tried to determine the types of relationships other than geographical proximity that make the exchanges of knowledge and know-how, as well as the creation of confidence between organisms possible. To answer this question, it introduces a concept which is not widely used in the academic literature on the globalisation of the R&D: the concept of proximities (Boschma 2005). Weused six types of proximities in order to understand the dynamics of the foreign R&D centres: the geographical proximity, the formal and informal institutional proximities, the organisational, cultural and social proximities. The results of our study show that each phase of the evolution of the foreign R&D centre can be characterised by an architecture of proximities between the centre, its internal innovation network and its local environment.Our results come from several empirical observations: 1/ we have built and organized a focus groupon the globalisation of R&D during two years. This focus group was made of several industrial R&Dmanagers, 2/ we have studies the Indian foreign R&D centres of four multinational companies: ABB,AkzoNobel, Procter & Gamble and Siemens, 3/ we have used several short case studies gatheredduring informal interviews and professional meetings on the globalisation of R&D. This empirical work has been realized in the framework of a public-private partnership between our laboratory and the European Association for Industrial Research Management (EIRMA)."
"He thesis focuses on the determinants of venture capital dynamism. Our approach aims not only at identifying factors that led to the phenomenal development of this activity in the United States, but also at explaining why Europe still cannot catch up in terms of venture capital. Several conclusions can be inferred from this thesis. On the one hand, an active financial market cannot be regarded as the main factor explaining the comparative advantage of the U.S. in terms of venture capital. On the other hand, other more important factors may explain the superiority of U.S. venture capital as well as the European countries delay. Estimates conducted to highlight the importance of demand and of the expected performance for the venture capital dynamism. These two factors represent the strengths and the specificity of the U.S. venture capital. The estimates have also highlighted the role of scientific and technological environment, that can explain the delay of European countries which suffer from shortcomings in R&D spendings and, might illustrate the success of two venture capital models based on the research and development strategy: Sweden and Israel."
"Based on the emergence of a new technology as a starting point, this thesis deals with the capacity of industrial actors to reorganise their knowledge bases. In that purpose, we study knowledge integration processes dened as the search for technological complementarity in the knowlegde bases of actors engaged in innovation activities. In a given technological environment, the search for technological complementarity signifies the search for the most productive technological combinations. Our analysis is based on two dimensions: the intra-organisational knowledge integration processes and the inter-organisational knowledge integration processes. Applied to the case of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, the econometric research - based on innovations, patents and alliances databases - conducted in this thesis allows us to draw two main results. Regarding the intra-organisational knowledge integration processes, we emphasize that the search for technological complementarity is determined by the stock offundamental knowledge that promotes the firrm's capacity to combine knowledge and hence, its capacity to innovate. Regarding the inter-organisational knowledge integration processes, we show that the search for technological complementarity determines the choice given to actors of one industry to form a strategic alliance, and that this search for technological complementarity evolves throughout the technological life cycle."
"The choice of a guided surface transit system operated on separated RoW is a complex and difficult task. Even if different transit systems could provide equivalent services to users, we often lack the necessary information to better distinguish among different systems. Beyond giving a presentation of different surface guided systems structuring the public transport networks in France, the aim of this research is to conduct a comparative analysis in order to better guide decisions of local authorities in their efforts to promote urban transport that meets the challenges of sustainable development. The advantages and the drawbacks of each system are analyzed and presented in a disaggregated way. In addition, a multicriteria method ELECTRE III is proposed and discussed for aggregating the results and proposing system(s) best suited for different operating conditions. The main result shows that the modern tramway on rail occupies a privileged place in most scenarios. However, the CIVIS, Translohr, TVR and even trolleybuses have their places with respect to operating conditions, given that the related infrastructure and operating costs are taken into account. The results of this research therefore encourage us to recommend, every time we propose a surface transit system, to review the whole range of systems and to do the comparative analysis with different context and time constraints integrating mid-term and long-term visions and predictable effects on the urban requalification"
"Climate change could affect water resources and hydraulic infrastructures seriously. Dimensioning and operation of reservoirs should therefore be modified according to climatic change scenarios. To assess the effect of climate uncertainty on reservoir volumes dimensioning using cost-benefit analysis, a model of reservoir dimensioning at the river basin scale is applied in Greece. For the case study, there is no cost of error and adaptation seems to be inefficient. A methodology at the scale of the Mediterranean region with a generic modeling at the river basin level is developed.  Reservoirs networks and reservoirs-demands links are reconstructed and coordinated reservoirs networks operation is determined, using only globally available data. The link reconstruction methodology is applied on irrigation demand and validated qualitatively on Algeria. Change in reliability with adaptation of reservoir operating rules under climate change over the Mediterranean region is then assessed. Reliability changes seem to be more influenced by inflow changes than by demand changes. They are not important for the Nile basin and the European and Middle East sub-regions, while in North African countries with a more pronounced Mediterranean influence, like Tunisia or Algeria, reliability decrease can be significant"
"Traffic road modelling in the dense network of a wide area needs a large amount of data. It renders a keen modelling unmanageable in practice. To simplify the problem, an idea is to aggregate the network links as continuous medium where traffic road flows as a fluid on a surface. This modelling is called two-dimensional. Even if the detailed geometric structure of the network is lost, such a modelling avoids the traffic keen description on a network where measure points are not numerous enough to allow an exhaustive evaluation of traffic state. A series of articles started in the 80's have highlighted relevant concepts. Nevertheless, these previous works have not solved fundamental modelling issues: how to deduce and model global behaviours basing on local behaviours (flow on an axe, interactions at intersections). Two models are developed. The first model is static. Traffic road flows on privileged directions (orthogonal). The model takes into account the balance between the network trip supply and the users' elastic trip demand. The principal outputs are, for each point of the network and each destination, the directional flows and the trip costs. The second model is dynamical. The description of traffic flows stands at the level of elementary traffic cells, where concepts of supply and demand are defined. With a behaviour law deduced from a discrete network, we establish the conservation dynamic equation of road traffic at each point of an anisotropic network"
"Since the mid-Nineties, Islamic mutual funds and indices have received a significant level of academic scrutiny. However, the debate over their under-Performance or over-Performance is not over yet. The prime objective of our study is to explore the stakes, the performance and the persistence in performance of this category of indices and funds. As for indices, the study used a sample of 57 Islamic indices and their conventional benchmarks. It is carried out through a) studying the similarities and differences between Islamic and conventional indices; b) surveying the current literature by performing both narrative and meta-Analytical review of the literature, c) studying the efficiency and their potential for diversification; d) comparing the return, the risk and the performance of Islamic indices with their conventional counterparts, e) ranking Islamic indices using various performance measures; and f) studying the persistence using the four-Factor pricing model. Despite their lack of diversification, the study finds that Islamic indices have, in average, the same level of inefficiency and performance as their conventional counterparts. As for funds, the study used a sample of 111 Islamic equity funds over the period April 2005 to March 2011 and carried out through applying different performance measures and non-Parametric tests of performance persistence over three equal sub-Periods. The study finds much heterogeneity in Islamic funds‘ performance and a little evidence that supports non-Persistence in performance of Islamic mutual funds during and after the last financial crisis."
"Since the mid-Nineties, Islamic mutual funds and indices have received a significant level of academic scrutiny. However, the debate over their under-Performance or over-Performance is not over yet. The prime objective of our study is to explore the stakes, the performance and the persistence in performance of this category of indices and funds. As for indices, the study used a sample of 57 Islamic indices and their conventional benchmarks. It is carried out through a) studying the similarities and differences between Islamic and conventional indices; b) surveying the current literature by performing both narrative and meta-Analytical review of the literature, c) studying the efficiency and their potential for diversification; d) comparing the return, the risk and the performance of Islamic indices with their conventional counterparts, e) ranking Islamic indices using various performance measures; and f) studying the persistence using the four-Factor pricing model.

"In today’s world of globalization, quality becomes a strategic tool to face the new economic and social stakes of the enterprise by its impact on jointly controlling the quality of the product and the processes supporting its production as well. This control is directly related to the coherent organization of the quality activities which are structured on the different enterprise levels. One of the major challenges is to set up the quality process as a process according to the “system” definition; i.e. a process which effectively integrates the quality activities on the different enterprise levels as well as with other processes belonging to the enterprise. Coping to this challenge, several methodologies and methods were proposed to support the whole or a part of modelling the process quality. However, the lack of formalization harms the effectiveness and the efficiency of their application. Regarding this double report on integration and lack of formalization, our contribution consists in developing a generic quality approach for formalising a process quality at the tactical level linked to the other enterprise levels. This approach is in accordance with the TQM to control and improve jointly the quality of the product and the production process. Since we propose and automated approach, it can be deployed from the design phase to the exploitation phase of the process quality control. The originality of this work consists on the unification, in the form of meta-models, of the quality concepts on the basis of: the process approach defined in the standard ISO9000:2000, the function ""quality management"" as defined by the standard IEC/ISO62264, the quality methods, and finally on the modelling of relevant indicators. The feasibility of this approach is shown by an application case of a manufacturing process."
"Despite of the banking M&A development, all do not allow to increase the performance of theconcerned companies. Indeed, the rate of failure of these operations is hight and since a long time, researchers wonder strongly about the real reasons of these failures. Many factors influencing the performance were moved forward to explain the success or the failure ofa M&A operation ; but these studies, have often based themselves on quantitative esearches methodsnot allowing to detect a single precise and major factor standing out most from all the elements influencing the performance and explaining the merger and acquisition result. Indeed, one exclusively financial vision constitutes a narrow vision of what a banking M&A operation is as its success or its failure also depends on the synergy realization concerning strategic domains, processuel, organizational and cultural of these operations.The mission of our study is to examine the following issue : What determining factor explains the M&A success or failure perceived in the banking sector? Through a qualitative study, constituted and analyzed by the multiples cases method (17 interviews have been conducted), our investigations have tryied to explain how the arbitration between the M&A performance is made, namely a positive or negative result realized, and the performance perceptionwhich have the actors, having lived closely or remotely a M&A opération. Finally , our research shows that  the organizational dimension is at the heart of our results having adecisive impact on the M&A result whether it is positive (success) or negative (failure)."
"This dissertation investigates how the real effective exchange rate (REER) and its associated  asurements (REER volatility and REER misalignment) affect total factor productivity growth (TFPG). It also analyzes the channels through which the REER and its associated measurements act on total factor productivity (TFP). The first part studies how the REER itself, on the one hand, and the REER volatility, on the other hand, influence productivity. An analysis of the link between the level of REER and TFP in chapter 1 reveals that an exchange rate appreciation causes an increase of TFP. But this impact is also nonlinear: below the threshold, real exchange rate influences negatively productivity while above the threshold it acts positively. The results of chapter 2 illustrate that REER  volatility affects negatively TFPG. We also found that REER volatility acts on TFP according to the level of financial development. For moderately financially developed countries, REER volatility reacts negatively on productivity and has no effect on productivity for very low and very high levels of financial development. The second part examines the channels through which the REER and its associated measurements influence productivity.  The results of chapter 3 illustrate that the exchange rate volatility has a strong negative impact on investment. This outcome is robust in low income and middle income countries, and by using an alternative measurement of exchange rate volatility. Chapter 4 show that both real exchange rate misalignment and real exchange rate volatility affect negatively exports. It also demonstrates that real  exchange rate volatility is more harmful to exports than misalignment. These outcomes are corroborated by estimations on subsamples of Low- ncome and Middle-Income countries"

"It has been commonly acknowledged that in order to reach the target clienteles with loans at attractive terms and conditions, an appropriate technology for delivering financial services must be developed. Next to this, current developments in microfinance industry encourage MFIs to offer wide-ranging services within a multiservice portfolio including microsavings, microinsurance, remittances, mobile banking etc. One of the main pillars of this trend has become MFIs increasing interest in the expansion into the savings market to reach more poor clients as well as to lower costs by attracting presumably cheaper deposits. Joint services are tailored to better meet needs of the poor and aim at building sustainable financial systems and establishing closer and long-term relationship with clients. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of microfinance has generated another essential and closely related trend: commercialization. The focus of this dissertation is on three emerging issues associated with the development of microfinance sector: incentive mechanisms to address contract enforcement and screening problems, performance of MFIs though the lenses of combined microfinance services (credit plus savings), and performance of MFIs though the lenses of capital structure. The essays in the dissertation vary in research methodology: one essay is theoretical and two are empirical. Moreover, the data come from diverse microfinance units: Microfinance Information Exchange (MIX) online database and Microfinance Centre for Central & Eastern Europe and the New Independent States (MFC). As far as methods are concerned the empirical essays use less frequently applied methodologies in microfinance studies: seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) and propensity score matching (PSM)."
"Recognition affects every one in a lot of situation. Because it’s semantic complexity, the concept is not easy to clearly define and use it. Miscellaneous branches as : Philosophy, psychology, Sociology, Biology or Anthropology, are wondering by this concept of recognition. This concept is still used more and more by the Management Sciences. This period is marked by development of multiculturalism, the appearance of economic crisis, an increase of impersonal management of the human being and a loss of work sense. So, researchers and practitioners are thinking about the way over to set forth right recognition rules and about the costs created by the defects of recognition at work. Indeed, it becomes a necessity to place Man into the heart of the work and secure a mutual respect between the various actors, hierarchical or not.This research object is emerging in the field of Management Sciences. However, it is the basis of currents events, especially concerning the diversity management and the social responsibility. So, the subject is really at the focal point of moral stakes. Facing the impacts sourced by the depersonalization into the working organizations, more and more people from the bottom to the top of theirs hierarchy are questioning on the social and economic stakes coming from missing recognition and recognition management. This thesis aims at to place in an obvious position the strong links existing between recognition and performance, especially when the organizations want sustainable socioeconomic performances.The first part of the thesis clarify the abstract and methodological bases of these investigations and set out our experimentations fields. The recognition concept is approached under a polysemic and interdisciplinary angle. The justification of the methodology, the exploitation of more than 400 interviews from 12 organizations with the whole employee’s grades and the study of two longitudinal cases testify the robustness of the research work.The second part explain the socially constructed origin of recognition according to the history of each person. It analyzes its perceptive and symbolical aspects. We propose a list of the system of recognition and make an inventory of several transverse factors acting upon the recognition perceptions and their impacts on the feelings of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. At last, we study the influence of three variables : the organization size, the hierarchical level and the business branch, upon the recognition expectations.The third part analyzes two longitudinal cases and establishes links between recognition and performance. We estimate the costs connected to the bad practices in recognition and to the lack of recognition. We categorize two dialectical recognition systems into the organizations and bring results according to these practices. At last, we suggest some possibilities for a recognition enhancement aiming to develop sustainable socioeconomic performances by the elaboration of concept : « activating recognition »."
"This thesis investigates the determinants and issues of gender diversity in the composition of corporate governance structures. The thesis aims at contributing to the debate on the feminization of corporate governance structures. It puts into perspective the ongoing debates on the economic value-added of gender diversity in corporate board of directors.  Under the current discussions on the role and composition of corporate board in value creation, this thesis focuses on aspects related to competencies, and learning and innovation capacity. The research shows, in particular, the plausibility of the business case theory. The results clearly show that the feminization of corporate governance structures involve economic and managerial concerns. They stress that feminization brings distinctive expertise to corporate board of directors. It participates positively in good governance and as a result, carries out a competitive advantage for companies. In addition, financial market encourages the integration of women in corporate Board of Directors. Although the results call for caution in imposing bias gender diversity in corporate boards as an essential means of performance, the thesis concludes that companies must consider measures of feminization of their governing structures."
"The issue of access to heamthcare is crucial in our modern society. One obvious effect of the augmentation of healthcare services demand is the increasing occupancy rates in hospitals. The main difference between the provision of care at the hospital and at home is as follows: the patient is at hospital and all the resources necessary for its treatment are in the same place, while in the care delivered at home, resources must be moved to the bedside. There are several challenges in order to achieve this change. In this thesis we address three important issues in the design of structures of home care. First, the location of structures minimizing logistics costs, where we develop three models with different features such as traveling costs of resources, changes in demand over time and evolution of freelance resources. These models allow us to provide robust location over time while ensuring maximum coverage and minimizing costs. The second issue is the choice of activities, epidemiological and spatial coverage, taking into account different types of activities and resources, permissions to serve some pathologies and coverage. Two models developed allow us to show the effects on the demand allocation and resources planning induced by changes in the costs of freelance professionals and authorization to serve some pathologies. The third problem is the dimensioning of resources with demand uncertainty (volume, epidemiological and geographical) and the proposed model takes into account the underlying problem of moving resources using an estimate of the routes performed."
"The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to our better understanding of the main factors behind large and persistent gender disparities in Africa's labour markets. This work looks at three key dimensions of labour market gender inequality in Africa: (i) the gender wage gap, (ii) gender inequalities in allocating time to market and household work, and (iii) the gender-differentiated income effect of informality. Chapter 2 shows that, in Ethiopia, progress towards gender equity in education is important to improve women's wages but not enough to close most of the gender wage differential. Other interventions would be needed as, for instance, information campaigns and other awareness-raising efforts in support of the anti-discriminatory provisions of Ethiopia's own constitution and legislation, to compensate for the adverse impact of unobservable factors (discriminatory practices, social and cultural norms…), that directly contribute to the gender wage gap and indirectly, through job selection. Chapter 3 highlights the coexistence of two phenomena in Ethiopia, a strong gender-based division of labour and a double work burden on women. The country would benefit from pursuing and intensifying its efforts to ensure better access to education at all levels for women, and from providing better information and enforcement of the law in support of women's economic and social well-being, as it would help changing mentalities and attitudes that impede women to take full advantage of their abilities and that keep them subordinated to men. Finally, in Chapter 4 we observe that, in Tanzania, women face a significantly higher informal employment wage penalty than men. To explain this result, we conjecture that the exclusion hypothesis, according to which individuals are denied access to formal jobs due to the disproportionate constraints they face (burden of household responsibilities, lack of adequate infrastructure…), is more acute among women.JEL classification : J16, J22, J24, J31, J42, J71"
"This research discusses the tools of land use conflict analysis and methods for their prevention and management, on the basis of existing conflicts created by infrastructural projects in developing countries. Such conflicts have entailed expropriation of homes, farm businesses and other productive resources in rural settings. Specifically, we use data from the case of Chotiari water reservoir project in Pakistan, where we put stress on project impacts on socio-economic and natural resource values in the region, by highlighting root causes of the conflicts with response to land use decision. We also paid attention on the network of actors over land use and property right violation, which have created dissimilar power distribution and significant land use conflicts. Through this research we show that conflicts created by the project have resulted from structural factors (unilateral decision, lack of technical and scientific investigation, corruption, international interest, and non-existence of national resettlement policy) and proximate factors (nepotism, ethnic diversity/disarray, and illiteracy). Moreover, forceful displacement of local population has led for multiplication of the confrontations. From these results, we provide helpful insights and information for the recommendations in terms of land use conflict prevention and management, mainly based on proximity relations analysis."
"The research has been conducted in Bukit Barisan High Land zone consists of eight regencies located in the northern part of North Sumatra province, Indonesia. It is found that the zone is entrapped in a high poverty rate and a high unemployment level. The regions main employment sector is agriculture, where more than 50 percent of the total workforce engages in the sector. The main challenging of the regions is a very low productivity. This is due to lack of management practices and capacities in term of tools inputs, and knowledge now-how. Moreover, the lack of information and coordination between the actors of the economy i.e. farmers-local governments-enterprises-and universities in the regions has dragged away the value added products and inherited in high fluctuation of the commodities in term of prices and qualities. Accordingly a new cooperation needs to be made between all the actors of the economy in the regions. As information has a vital role in the development of the regions, this sector hence ought to be diffused in an appropriate way. This information center then called as a Competitive Intelligence (CI) Center, which is importantly formed in each region in Bukit Barisan High Land zone. The CI center will ensure the formation of the sound development programs to be applied in the regions in order to achieve a desirable growth within the regions and within the country as a whole. The program of CI center is emphasized on enhancing the potentials of each region and overcome its problems and challenging. In this thesis, Bukit Barisan High Land which consists of 8 regions is categorized as one zone regarding similarity in its topography, climate, type of soil, social condition of the society, its potentials and problems. The development of the region then suggested by the creation of the Small and Medium Enterprises close to the region to ensure the achievement of value chain between suppliers and producers in this case Farmers and enterprises. This value chain can only be achieved by a solid collaboration by all economic actors. Based on the findings, it is suggested that the most prospective commodities need to be intensified are coffee and corn. Corn is perceived as one of a prospective export regarding a continuous increase demand for the commodity globally, whereas coffee is a permanent export commodity where the decreasing supply by Vietnam has contributed to more opportunity to Indonesia. In order to provide some vision to investors, the feasibility studies of the plantation and production of two commodities will be presented at the last part of the thesis"
"This research seeks to detect the institutional and regulatory constraints that limit the development of informal units in Djibouti by both the macroeconomic and microeconomic analysis. The review shows that institutional habits (corruption, going right) in regulation created transaction costs and force small businesses to take refuge in the informal sector. A regression model shows that the quality of justice (as measured by this indicator of Rule of Law of the World Bank) is a determining variable in explaining the weight of the non-observed economy and hence the informal sector in GDP official. The dynamics of micro-enterprises is approached from 2 surveys (2001 and 2005) on the same sample. The analysis of mobility through transition matrices reveals the existence of three thresholds (1 employee, 2-5 employees, 6-9 employees and 10 employees and more) and not only one single threshold, albeit it confirms the thesis of «missing-middle». The discriminating factor analysis indicates that the law is a crucial variable that explains the apparent blocking of micro-enterprises beyond 6 to 9 employees. Finally, the 2007 survey on the money transfer activities (hawalas) shows that these institutions have a significant impact on the macroeconomic level and suggests that their usefulness and specificity should be taken into account in order to integrate this banking device within the formal financial system."
"The research is based on theoretical analyses which come to clarify field reports and search results. It presents the current dynamics of work and marks out the link between the meaning and the real-life experience of work. The shift from a collective conception to a very individual apprehension of the profession leads to think of the emergence of a new model of worker, entrepreneur of himself. The field of the social sector profession world is presented as an example, a sort of laboratory for the analysis of the transformations. The implemented methodology on three different but articulated grounds here, is essentially qualitative; thus giving the opportunity to retranscribe the words of the actors in this specific field where the relation is essential. The theoretical and methodological anchoring of this thesis allows to conceive the interest of the detour by the meaning of work so as to conceive new practices of human resource management which re-give evidence of the centrality and value of work both for the individual and for the organization. Decisive key factors for the conduct of activities are highlighted and structured around two large managerial orientations: The reintroduction of the dialogue in working collectives inspired by the planning for trades method,  The implementation of meaning-oriented management by building cooperation within professions and organizations, that is where work condenses."
"In the French context, banks play an essential role in financing firms, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) since they have more difficulties accessing equity capital markets. The process used by banks to decide whether and how much to lend relies on different lending technologies and banks usually tend to use more than one technology at a time (Berger and Udell, 2006). Among the various lending technologies, relationship lending has a peculiar role. However, research on relationships lending pays only marginal attention to the role of social ties and trust on financing conditions for SMEs. Social relationships literature suggests that the more commercial transactions between a firm and the bank it borrows from are embedded in social attachments, the more expectations of trust and reciprocity shape transacting. Thereby, it would promote governance benefits and transfers of soft information (Uzzi, 1999). Thus, these relationships can play an Important role in reducing agency problems, moral hazard, adverse selection and transaction costs as well as the costs of monitoring and control. The present exploratory study is an attempt to fill this gap by investigating how social interaction affects the terms of loan financing for SMEs (credit access, interest rate, guarantees, defaults). It is based on a survey of bank lending managers and entrepreneurs."
"Given the limited ability of many of these countries to raise domestic resources through taxation, external finance is essential to support a multi-year public investment program aimed at developing public capital in infrastructure, health, and education. Thus, governments, aid agencies, and citizens from industrialized countries have often transfer capital flows to those countries to help them follow a sustainable growth and finance their development. The most external financial resources for development included foreign aid, foreign direct investment and workers' remittances. The effectiveness of these external flows to sustain development has long been a hotly contested subject among economists. Hope and frustration surrounding the development finance flows and their ability to promote growth and reduce poverty, generated an important literature with conflicting policies recommendations.The broad subject of this thesis is whether foreign aid and the other External Capital Flows are effective in promoting development. We propose a transversal analysis of the effectiveness of external development financing developed around the three groups concerned by this debate: the recipients, the aid architecture and the actors of development, and the researchers - whose results influence policymakers actions. The first part uses meta-analysis methodology to draw a literature review on external development finance flows with a particular interest on the research processes follow by the empirical studies, in order to explain the conflicting results in the empirical studies. The underlying idea of meta-analysis is to subtract the empirical evidences from authors' characteristics, econometric or methodological choices, to sum up the effective knowledge from existing works. The second part focuses on recent evolutions in aid architecture with the increasing influence of emerging donors. This part of the thesis analyzes the impact of non-DAC donors’ aid allocation on government fiscal choices in recipient countries and on traditional donors' aid allocation.The third part of the thesis proposes new evidences of the impact of external capital flows for development and international measures for development. First, we propose an analysis of the link between development financing and business cycles fluctuations in developing countries. We conclude the thesis by addressing one of the major difficulties in the development assistance, that is assessing the impact of different policies and programs designed to support the less developed countries. We evaluate the impact of Least Developed Country (LDC) status on economic growth and the vulnerability to economic shocks."
"This research report deals with the subjects of the extension of foreign investments into emerging countries. the particularity nowaday is the internationalisation of strategic activity such as R&D. Many inquiries can be rise since, multinational technology activities are not anymore limited to simple adaptation activity. Emerging countries like China are emplementing their own technology trajectories, so as to attract more and more foreign R&D. This has to do with a change in the behavior of the foreign multinational because the conventional model not only cannot predict the internationalisation of R&D into emerging countries, but even when it does so, it assumes that the suitable technology activies into emerging countries are those limited to adapt home technology. I explain foreign multinational behavior by extending HEWITT (1981) model of internationalisation of R&D. I found that most of the R&D going to emerging countries is for development and adaptation. But the question still remains to know why some multinationals are extending their innovative activities into emerging countries and create regional innovation hubs (choosing one country to play the role of main regional innovation hub). I assume that multinational are both technology exploiting and technology explorer, their motivation are more than sharing their technology with emerging countries, but they aim at exploring technology opportunities in other for them to differentiate and innovate and stay a breath of what the competition is doing. In this part the research all the statistics and indicators show that China is playing the leading role with a technology trajectory above those of the three others countries. This seems to explain why China instead of India is the most attractive destination of foreign investment in production and in R&D."
"Complex financial systems, such as the interbank network, can be naturally captured using a network approach. This allows to calculate contamination of defaults and to model systemic risk. Our network is composed of identically capitalized agents. The effect of a capitalization ratio is determined depending on the maximization horizon of the agents: short-term, myopic or long-term. When agents optimize their payoffs in the long-run, the capitalization ratio is fully effective and prevents systemic risk. However, when agents adopt a myopic behavior, the capitalization ratio may trade systemic risk for liquidity scarcity.	Starting from a production economy, in which firms face stochastic investment opportunities, we study the impact of the interest rates on bubbles in firms' prices. Capital of firms is exclusively made of equity, but when facing an investment opportunity, firms may borrow. Precisely, firms access short-term debts, and the amount of the debt is limited to a fraction of the price of their equities. This model seems to recreate bubbles on firms' prices. Unfortunately, interest rates do not affect prices to a large extent, and we may question whether prices of firms include a bubble component, with respect to the standard definition of bubbles: the discounted sum of the incoming cash flows.	This previous model is extended by allowing firms to have a permanent debt. Actually, capital of firms is composed of equity and debt. In this case, firms' prices are very sensitive to interest rates, and may be discontinuous when interest rate shocks last over the periods. This model also exhibits a purely bubbly state: prices of firms only represent capitals profits generated by debts, there is no equity."
"Strategic alliances and mergers & acquisitions are theoretically now considered as real levers of value creation. This value creation takes different forms, essentially strategic value, substantial value, institutional value and financial value (including shareholders). This latter holds our attention specifically. The objective of our research, after analyzing the results of empirical works focused on the acquisition announcements impact on the stock market performance, is to answer two fundamental questions. The first question is to know that if, on a more or less distant horizon, the stock market performance of acquisitions coincides with the actual performance and so if this form of acquisitions can be justified by the financial motivation of CEOs or shareholders. The second question is to know that if this hypothesis is also true in the case of alliances, establishing by the way an advantageous comparison in favor of one or other of the external growth options. Our final results show that in the short term the announcement of an alliance has a negative impact on performance as opposed to the announcement of a merger & acquisition, while other hand on the long-term, there is no positive impact (neutral impact) on financial performance whether it be the strategic alliance or merger & acquisition. We explain this result by the phenomenon of ""creation of compensatory value"" in the context of a strategic and financial plan."
"This work concerns the mutualist governance. From a frame of analysis based on legitimacy theory, we tried to understand how appears legitimacy in mutual organisation context today. The proposal is that it exists inevitably a gap between the legitimacy built by managers and the legitimacy perceived by the stakeholders. Managers display then strategies of legitimization by a communication based on mutualist references. The mutualist model would become a management tool. In a phase of quantitative research with the involved stakeholders, we identify a common base shared between stakeholders, as well as a mutualist gap, which concerns the perception that the company masters its projet and contributes to the territory. A typology of the stakeholders is drawn up around a horizontal split. The qualitative analysis of speech reveals different patterns, based on communication, politics and management."
"The development of Internet advertising and the increasing presence of music in our daily lives oriented us to investigate the audio ad banner. Based on previous work, we attempt to understand the impact of music on the net surfer’s attitude varying the types of music and the tempos. Thus, we studied the impact of the characteristics of the music on the responses to advertising, but also the role of the preference, the activation and the typicality, implication and musical expertise of net surfer. In the study, scales are adapted and validated in the Turkish context.The study showed that the affective and cognitive influences of the music can influence together responses to advertising. The music, by its presence, increases the memorization of the banner. Consistency between the tempo and type of music supports the preference. Therefore, these two easy to manipulate elements must not be neglected in a campaign. In addition, the results related to the implication should help in targeting Internet users."
"The present dissertation studies the formation of the demand for the main retail payment instruments (cash, bank card and check). The first chapter presents both a theoretical and empirical analysis using French data. We conclude that charging cash withdrawals at ATMs outside the network of the bank reduces the global demand for cash. The second chapter concludes, with the help of a theoretical model and on the basis of French data, that a seller adjust prices in order to make the buyers pay cash by making cash payment more convenient, in the sense that they limit the number of coins and notes exchanged. All other things being equal, we show that convenient prices are more frequent and more frequently paid cash. The third and fourth chapters study the impact of crime as an environmental factor on the merchant side, more specifically on the  preference for cash and card acceptance. We show that in an environment with a high level of financial criminality, merchants have a higher preference for cash and are less likely to accept bank cards. The fifth chapter studies the impact of crime as an environmental factor on the choice of payment instrument by consumers. They are more likely to own a payment card, and the weekly sums withdrawn at ATMs are higher. We find opposite effects for Violent Crime. Eventually, the sixth chapter studies the impact of perceived risk on the holding and and use of payment instruments. We apply the model of Jacoby and Kaplan (1972) to payment instruments, and we conclude on the basis of an empirical investigation that the risk of lack and the time risk have the most cross-cutting effects on the demand for each of the main retail payment instruments."
"Two hundred participants from different sectors have made three different experiments (s) to test the hypothesis of applying the methods of engineering to the field of furniture design, as well as the interior design. We obtained a conclusive result from the analysis of the problem, by using the TRIZ in the field of interior design, and by studying the design of furniture. Students are able to design a complete space with specific furniture. The Quality of artifacts (58 artifacts) which are estimated by several experts have induced that the transformation of methods of creativity in the field of furniture's design is a possible hypothesis. The cultural dimension of the project, related to the application of these methods in cooperation with foreign students from several universities of space design, is a compelling argument for supporting creativity's methods as an educational and professional source of the first order"
"Financial markets evolve more or less rapidly and strongly to all kind of information depending on time period of study. In this context, we intend to measure a broad set of information influence on systematic multi-assets classes “euro neutral” arbitrage portfolios either for “naive” diversification and optimal diversification. Our research focuses on systematic tactical asset allocation and we group these information under the name of heterogeneous data (market data and “other market information”). Market data are “end of day” asset closing prices and “other market information” gather economic cycle, sentiment and volatility indicators. We assess the influence of a heterogeneous data combination on our arbitrage portfolios for a time period including the subprimes crisis period and thanks to data analysis and quantization algorithms. The impact of a heterogeneous data combination on our arbitrage portfolio is materialized by increasing return, increasing return/volatility ratio for the post subprimes crisis period, decreasing volatility and asset class correlations. These empirical findings suggest that “other market information” presence could be an element of arbitrage portfolio risk diversification. Furthermore, we investigate and bring empirical results to Blitz and Vliet (2008) issue on global tactical asset allocation (GTAA) by considering “predictive” variables with a systematic market timing process integrating heterogeneous data thanks to a quantitative data processing."
"This research focuses on sustainability assessment in the upstream phase of an architectural project. This thesis points out the need to assess the impacts of pre-design's phases decisions on the sustainable development aspects. The upstream phase is very important because of their low cost and the large range of possible solution. As a consequence a tool or model is required that can help designers/Architects to identify sustainability potential in pre-design phase : this will constitute a ""Decision aids tool"" for architecture. Taking into account the impacts of sustainability in the upstream phase, the designer/Architects can achieve a different view and take advantage of these environmental effects to increase the level of sustainability of the project. The ""Design to Objective"" method (DTO) is used as an approach to provide a tool for decision support. This approach helps architects making decision. In addition, due to the DTO, all stakeholders in the field of construction can contribute to the programming phase. On the other hand, attention is directed toward the socio-cultural aspect which has been neglected by existing methods. This tool / software (SustainPro) has been experimented on four real projects in Iran. Experimental outcomes attest of the pertinence of the proposed approach"

The aim is to study the following question: what kind of strategies might be developed by manufacturing plants in order to survive and remain in the value chain of a multinational despite a context of globalization and costs rationalization? The historical analysis of the case of IBM Montpellier allows us to interpret the phenomenon of local survival as resulting from the maturation of a managerial process of survival by transformation. This process is composed of three stages: a compliance phase during which local actors feel little exogenous pressures and simply adopt and implement practices and directives coming from headquarter; an opposition phase that emerges in response to sudden threats and consists in contesting the diffusion of some logics in order to protect and maintain the established local order; and a transformation phase during which local actors seek to anticipate future evolutions of the company and redefine local practices and logics in order to influence or bypass certain decisions deemed to threaten the future of the site. The thesis highlights the paradoxical nature of this survival strategic process since it lies at the interface between resistance and compliance. The approach studied consists in translating, negotiating, or deviating organizational changes instilled by headquarter. Finally, our observations show that for subsidiaries, a survival strategy entails not to fight change but to support it in order to find or to create their new place in the global value chain."
"The trademark is no longer considered as a distinctive sign, rather; it has become an intangible asset whose value can far exceed that of all other combined assets of a company. The Tunisian financial services sector has experienced several processes of mergers and acquisitions. These operations have provided an opportunity for companies in the sector to change names and to choose a new name, to maintain the old one or to keep the names of the allied companies (co-branding). The aim of this work is to study the impact of this strategy of co-branding on consumer attitudes (affective, conative and especially cognitive). The brand company in this research was considered as a social representation. In order to understand the impact of the strategy of co-branding on the brand image, it comes to assess the evolution of the central core and the peripheral system of this representation."
"The beginning of this century was marked by a renewed interest in the development of biofuels. The commitment of the international community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy concerns and agricultural markets were the main reasons for this development. Therefore, the production and consumption of biofuels have increased dramatically and took on an international dimension. This phenomenon magnitude has caused agricultural, environmental and economical concerns. The purpose of the thesis is to study all the implications of the development of biofuels - that is to say, economical, agricultural and environmental - in the context of the global economy. To promote biofuels as opposite to their fossil equivalents, important measures to support all sectors of biofuels have been established in different parts of the world. To study the impact of these policies, we conducted a comparative study between the measurements of the main players (Brazil, European Union and United States) and new actors in international markets. In addition to comparing the economic and environmental performance, we analyzed the influence of political support of key players on the political orientation of new actors involved in the production of biofuels (or raw materials). The second axis of the thesis focuses on the agricultural implications of biofuel development. Indeed, many events have marked the global agricultural markets over the past twenty years: the change in eating habits in developing countries, the scarcity of farmland in the historically producing and exporting regions, natural disasters... is a challenge for future food needs. In this context, the advent of biofuels is certainly an additional factor to existing tensions in global agricultural markets. In addition to increasing the pressure on prices, the development of biofuels contributes to the reorganization of the architecture of global agriculture in favor of developing countries. The last axis addresses the environmental impacts of biofuels. Internationalization (direct and / or indirect) of biofuels production gives a new dimension to the environmental implications of biofuels. Our approach is to study the environmental impacts of biofuels by separating the stages of production of raw materials, those of processing and of consumption. The results show that developing countries are exposed to high environmental risks. To mitigate these risks, the development of biofuels should be subject to certain conditions that will achieve a socio-economical and environmental sustainability."
"This thesis consists of three separate chapters related to economic decisions under risk. The first chapter presents axioms for an additively separable representation of preferences over probabilities. A simple axiomatization of variational preferences represented by the sum of an expected utility term and an entropic term is deduced. The second chapter consists of an axiomatic foundation of other-regarding preferences under social interactions, based on the model originally developed by Blume, Brock and Durlauf. The third chapter introduces the probabilistic model of quantum physics to decision theory. In this context, individuals have a private representation of the set of events."
"Synchronization of physical flows received significant attention in the literature. If the non-physical flows received special attention in areas such as SCM, financial for a long time was helpless. More worryingly, payment delays have long been seen as a means of reducing the need for working capital for large firms. The subprime crisis has had a serious impact on the financing of the smaller companies, endangering the very existence of the latter. Our initial synchronization job physical and financial flows educated in the context of a CIFRE partnership aimed at finding solutions to these problems by proposing models of optimization under constraints. However, our commitment to implement our work was in vain and our subject has gradually drifted to the discovery of the failure of the deployment of an ERP system. Our roots in a large enterprise sector French defense allowed us to implement an action research canonical three distinct phases and resulted in the production of a model of diffusion of innovation applied to the ERP. This model into 6 phases, described the successive stages of deployment, highlighting the impact of political forces within the organization"
"Mobile phone overtakes its first communication functions including payment functions. This thesis proposes an economic analysis of the key issues of mobile payment, it attempts to explain the reasons of the delay and its difficulties to emerge. First technology must stabilize, offer a unique and interoperable service to try to bring out a sufficient network of users. The analysis of the legal and financial environment of m-payment technology halfway between telephony and banking was necessary. The rest of the thesis is devoted to an analysis oriented to consumer then progresses to an analysis of the relationship between service providers analysis. A chapter is devoted to the development of an empirical model analyzing the reasons and conditions of user's adoption. Finally, the last two chapters are devoted to the modeling of possible relationships between service providers. These two chapters have several models to understand the many advantages but also the limitations of the mobile payment in a banked environment. They also offer an explanatory scenario to the success of m- payment solutions in emerging countries. And they highlight the interest from the point of view of banking services in these areas, the presence of co-offers, but especially and paradoxically solutions managed by operators."
"The main purpose of this study was undertaken in order to provide a comprehensivepicture of the effective entrepreneurial leadership style in Homestay community-based tourism(CBT) for sustainable performance by using the good-performance of Homestay CBT inThailand with has the operation toward to sustainable development. The case study strategies,which is one of the strategies in the qualitative research methodology was used. Data werecollected from multiple sources: documentary evidence, participant observation, and interviewswith the leader and people in three communities. The main finding of this study showed that todevelop the effective entrepreneurial leadership for sustainable performance, theentrepreneurial leadership needs three principles; Cognitive ambidexterity, SEERS (social,environmental, and economic responsibility and sustainability), and self-and social awarenessas the principle of Greenberg et al. (2011). However, in Cognitive ambidexterity aspect couldsubstitute by using the effective consultant teams. Besides, those of personality characteristicsare able to develop for sustainable communities."
"Empirical evidence and the theoretical literature both point to stock sustainability and the protection of marine biodiversity as important fisheries management issues. Decision-support tools are increasingly required to operationalize the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. These tools need to integrate (i) ecological and socio-economic drivers of changes in fisheries and ecosystems; (ii) complex dynamics; (iii) deal with various sources of uncertainty; and (iv) incorporate multiple, rather than single objectives. The stochastic co-viability approach addresses the trade-offs associated with balancing ecological, economic and social objectives throughout time, and takes into account the complexity and uncertainty of the dynamic interactions which characterize exploited ecosystems and biodiversity. This thesis proposes an application of this co-viability approach to the sustainable management of mixed fisheries, using two contrasting case studies: the French Bay of Biscay (BoB) demersal mixed fishery and the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF). Both fisheries entail direct and indirect impacts on mixed species communities while also generating large economic returns. Their sustainability is therefore a major societal concern. A dynamic bio-economic modelling approach is used to capture the key biological and economic processes governing these fisheries, combining age- (BoB) or size- (NPF) structured models of multiple species with recruitment uncertainty, and multiple fleets (BoB) or fishing strategies (NPF). Economic uncertainties relating to input and output prices are also considered. The bioeconomic models are used to investigate how the fisheries can operate within a set of constraints relating to the preservation of Spawning Stock Biomasses (BoB) or Spawning Stock Size Indices (NPF) of a set of key target species, maintenance of the economic profitability of various fleets (BoB) or the fishery as a whole (NPF), and limitation of fishing impacts on the broader biodiversity (NPF), under a range of alternative scenarios and management strategies. Results suggest that under a status quo strategy both fisheries can be considered as biologically sustainable, while socio-economically (and ecologically in the NPF case) at risk. Despite very different management contexts and objectives, viable management strategies suggest a reduction in the number of vessels in both cases. The BoB simulations allow comparison of the trade-offs associated with different allocations of this decrease across fleets. Notably, co-viability management strategies entail a more equitable allocation of effort reductions compared to strategies aiming at maximizing economic yield. In the NPF, species catch diversification strategies are shown to perform well in controlling the levels of economic risk, by contrast with more specialized fishing strategies. Furthermore analyses emphasize the importance to the fishing industry of balancing global economic performance with inter-annual economic variability. Promising future developments based on this research involve the incorporation of a broader set of objectives including social dimensions, as well as the integration of ecological interactions, to better address the needs of ecosystem-based approaches to the sustainable harvesting of marine biodiversity."
"The first chapter of my thesis is the general literature review of mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry. The second chapter provides an empirical analysis founded on the Malmquist total factor productivity change. I analyze China's 14 commercial banks from year 1998 to year 2007 by making use of Malmquist total factor productivity index. The results show that these 14 Chinese commercial banks experienced average of 6.3% annual productivity growth rate. The third chapter of my thesis is a theoretical model about impact of the entry of foreign banks for domestic banking industry. I select three entry modes: the creation of a new subsidiary, the M&A activity with a State Owned Bank and the M\&A activity with Joint Stock Banks. The model considered the conditions under which domestic bank shareholders increase their profits after an entry mode corresponding to cases (2) and (3). The fourth chapter of my thesis is based on the theoretical model of chapter 3, I conduct an empirical analysis. This chapter is concerned mainly the foreign bank entry effect in developing Asian economies. Using a data set of 86 banks from 6 Asian countries (China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Philippines and Thailand) for the 1998-2011 period, this chapter examines the effect of foreign banks M&As activities in domestic banking industry. Our results indicate that foreign bank entry is associated with an increase in domestic banks' profitability and the level of foreign bank penetration is more important than whether foreign bank conducted M&A activities with domestic banks."
"The high throughputs supported by the multimedia multicast services (MBMS) and the limited radio resources result in strong requirement for efficient radio resource management (RRM) in UMTS 3G networks. This PhD thesis proposes to solve the MBMS RRM problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. The work starts with a formal modeling of the problem, named as the Flexible Radio Resource Management Model (F2R2M). An in-depth analysis of the problem complexity and the search landscape is done from the model. It is showed that, by relaxing the OVSF code constraints, the MBMS RRM problem can be approximated as a Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem (MCKP). Such work allows us to compute the theoretical solution bounds by solving the approximated MCKP. Then the fitness landscape analysis shows that the search spaces are rough and reveal several local optimums. Based on the analysis, some metaheuristic algorithms are studied to solve the MBMS RRM problem. We first show that a Greedy Local Search (GLS) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) allow us to find better solutions than the existing approaches implemented in the UMTS system, however the results are instable due to the landscape roughness. Finally we have developed a Tabu Search (TS) mixed with a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm and we have compared it with GLS, SA and UMTS embedded algorithms. Not only the TS outperforms all the other approaches on several scenarios but also, by comparing it with the theoretical solution bounds generated by the MCKP solver, we observe that TS is equal or close to the theoretical optimal solutions."
"This thesis specifically investigates the investment strategy of microfinance investment funds from contextual data, employing a qualitative content analysis approach. Written information from 84 microfinance fund websites has been used as secondary sources, in order to search for the particular components contributing to the formulation of a well-designed investment strategy, and to answer to the main research question of this thesis. The main research question is “how are investment strategies of microfinance funds designed?” Ten sub-questions was raised after reviewing literature to answer this research question. This study examines only the information that microfinance investment funds are willing to inform to relevant parties regarding to their perspective and investment conditions in microfinance, and the scope does not extend to investors and microfinance institutions aspects. It is found the investment strategy of the fund is designed by including of a number of specific components such as investment objectives, selection criteria for eligible investments, investment sectors, investment instruments and their terms, funding structure, geographical distribution, risk, return, hedging, leverage, exit strategies, and investment selection procedures. The study’s findings suggest future research employing broader data sources, in particular to examine both investors and the microfinance institution sides, in order to obtain an effective investment strategy that is well matched with all relevant parties’ preferences. Subsequently, an evaluation of the impact of this strategy on investment decision should also be studied."
"This dissertation is made of four distinct chapters. The first chapter with Johan Hombert shows that when lending relationships are hurt, it reduces the number of innovative firms and foster inventor mobility who move out of geographical areas where lending relationships are hurt. The second chapter presents a work with Claire Célerier and shows that supply-side factors account for a large part of the unbanked household phenomenon in the US. The third chapter studies spillovers of innovation and shows that when some firms innovate less other firms in the same city innovate less in response and this effect declines sharply with distance. The fourth chapter with Olivier Dessaint presents evidence that managers systematically respond to near-miss liquidity shocks by temporarily increasing the amount of corporate cash holdings."
This research intends to investigate the relationship between criticism of firms and individual and collective strategies they use to address and exploit it. The case study of the orphan drug field in the United States and Europe shows the ability of firms to recover criticism and develop strategic responses allowing them to seize and/or create new opportunities and to identify and/or address new threats. This dissertation also contributes to the understanding of the process of constructing a new organizational field and shows the important role of stakeholders in this process.
"Our interest in this thesis is first to combine the different measurement techniques for operational risk in financial companies, and we highlight more and more the consequences of estimation risk which is treated as a particular part of operational risk. In the first part, we will present a full overview of operational risk, from the regulatory laws and regulations to the associated mathematical and actuarial concepts as well as a numerical application regarding the Advanced Measurement Approach, like Loss Distribution to calculate the capital requirement, then applying the Extreme Value Theory. We conclude this first part by setting a scaling technique based on (OLS) enabling us to normalize our external data to a local Lebanese Bank. On the second part, we feature estimation risk by first measuring the error induced on the SCR by the estimation error of the parameters, to having an alternative yield curve estimation and finishing by calling attention to the reflections on assumptions of the calculation instead of focusing on the so called hypothesis ""consistent with market values"", would be more appropriate and effective than to complicate models and generate additional errors and instability. Chapters in this part illustrate the estimation risk in its different aspects which is a part of operational risk, highlighting as so the attention that should be given in treating our models"
"Structural change in French dairy sector is one of the most important in agriculture with high rates of decreasing in the number of farms and increasing average farm size. This structural change is heterogeneous in space; the regions the most affected are those which are not traditional dairy producing. The regions which resist are the traditional dairy ones where dairying is highly developed. Agricultural policy instruments (dairy quota, price support, direct payments…) have affected those changes while trying to maintain the dairy production on a large part of France. The modifications to come of those instruments could modify the dairy farm location and structure. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the determinants of dairy farm growth and location, to identify which are those they foster growth and agglomeration of dairy farms and those they tend to slow down this growth and disperse dairy farms. To do so, we firstly estimate, using the non stationary Markov model, the impact of some economic and policy factors on the size farm distribution. Secondly, by means of the methods of spatial econometrics, we introduce a spatial dimension in this analysis to deal with regional differences and detect a possible effect of agglomeration externalities. Thirdly, we integrate a spatial dynamic recursive component to the non stationary Markov model. This allows us to model the effects of factors influencing the number, the size and the location of the dairy farms and to take account of interaction between locations. Those different methods allow us to show that agglomeration externalities are very important in the determination of the farm location as well as the growth of farm size. Pecuniary externalities and forward and backward linkages as well as the market prices are also determinant factors affecting farm structure and location. Agricultural policies, namely second pillar direct payments have a rather low impact in the structural adjustment of dairy farms. However subsidies to installation of young farmers are highly significant and positively related to farm growth and location. Environmental stringency seems to negatively affect dairy farm location and especially medium and large sized ones. Other livestock activities seem to compete with dairy farms especially smaller ones."
"An organization, it is primarily men and means to achieve goals, and sub-Saharanpimping networks are no exception to this rule. Like any organization they structure and mobilizestakeholders, implement strategies to achieve their goals. At the same time the question of theorganization causes including that of the organizational environment as an organization exists andevolves in a given environment with which interactions are created. The problem of organizationaldynamics of sub-Saharan pimping networks, raises the question of their visibility and legitimacy inthis environment, because they are criminal, secret organizations and therefore not eligible for anyadvertising. However, these networks do work well and the consequences of their actions areperceived. How to understand the possibility of operating in such circumstances ? It's certain, thatyoung women recruited by sub-Saharian pimps undergo management by terror. A key elementsuggests that these women live in fear that goes beyond the simple fear of the pimp. It's the« voodoo », a phenomenon linked to the socio-cultural realities of sub-Saharan communities. Doesthe institutional environment of sub-Saharan pimping networks inspire their operation ? This thesisaims to shed light on organizational practices and the operation of sub-Saharan pimping networks,in the light of two theories : neo-institutionalism and contingency. Both theories emphasize therelationship with the environment that can affect an organization and its behavior."
"This thesis is interested in understanding on how an expert behaves in a mass communication situation crisis. To attain this objective, we use the naturalistic decision making approach in which the context plays an essential role. In our case, we used the mass communication situation crisis. In fact, since couple of years ago, mass communication in an unusual important factor that is convenient to analyze in a rigorous way. The benefit will be double.  From a theoretical point of view, the aim is to observe the effects of the mass communication on the expert’s behaviors and in this way to reinforce the naturalistic approach. From a managerial point of view, we propose a learning method for the experts that face this context of actuality. This thesis is based on a qualitative methodology is order to analyze two extreme situations. The first one is the case of the hotel’s restaurant. In any crisis situation, experts can be leaders or followers: they follow the decision taken by other experts confronted to the same problem. In the case of a mass communication crisis situation, results reveal a higher percentage of followers. This shows a paradoxical behavior. Experts focus on the decision of their peers rather than on the content of the problem and use very low percentage of their own experience. Therefore, we estimate that an expert’s behavior is similar to a novice. Finally, we underline the importance of forming experts to mass communication crisis situations to help them overcome this challenge."
"The research focuses on how in Europe consumer groups attempt to increase their power by developing their influence strategies within the lobbying industry. We also try to assess the impact of the Internet on their level of competitiveness and their ability to influence. We have made use of theoretical reflections relevant to analysing the lobbying, such as the concept of influence, various concepts of the industrial economy, and consumer groups. We conclude from our review that lobbying consumer groups are fully-fledged stakeholders (Freeman, 1984). We propose our own definition of lobbying as well as an improved view of the lobbying-mix in conjunction with Internet usages. We observe the emergence of a new force (Porter, 1979, 2008) : the one of lobbying, which innervates in a concealed way the whole structure of any industry. The lobbying industry lives on its highly added value offer of services and has a double tradable asset. Our strategy to confront reality is twofold. We have conducted two case studies as well as a qualitative survey with a population of consumer associations representing 31 European countries, thus enabling us to offer a complete overview of the existing landscape. Our theoretical and methodological contributions include a description and a definition of the lobbying industry. They are also related to the very notion of influence strategy and research on consumer groups. Operational contributions concern the analysis and understanding of the role and strategies of consumer associations at the European level, interactions between actors of the lobbying industry, and the impact of the Internet on the influence strategies of consumer associations."
"This thesis is concerned with the role of interbank competition in Africa. During the past decade, African banking systems have witnessed profound changes in their structure with some implications on the level of competition. Although the traditional view argues that intensified competition encourages banks to increase the supply of funds and improves banks management, a more pessimistic view sustains that competition can be detrimental for efficiency, inclusion and stability of banking sectors, especially in opaque markets. The aim of this dissertation is therefore to shed a new light on this debate in the context of Africa by offering three empirical contributions. The first part of this thesis provides an overview of financial systems in sub-Saharan Africa and motivates the purpose of this dissertation. A review of the literature on the consequences of competition in banking is presented in Chapter 3. The different measures of competition in banking are discussed in Chapter 4. The three following chapters focus on the original contributions of this dissertation. Chapter 5 evaluates the evolution of bank competition over the last decade in African countries using a sample of West African banks. The findings, based on different measures of competition, show an increase of competition over the past decade. Chapter 6 investigates the relationship between market power and efficiency. Empirical results document that banks with more market power are able to reduce costs but do no better at maximizing profits than banks with less market power. In Chapter 7, the complex relation ship between credit availability and competition is analyzed using a large sample of 70 developing countries. Findings show that firms located in countries with competitive banking markets have a significantly lower probability to be credit constrained. Results show that competition not only leads to less severe loan approval decisions but also reduces borrowers' discouragement. The general conclusion of this thesis underlines the beneficial consequences of competition even in on-mature banking systems and discusses several measures to enhance competition in these markets."
"In a context where productive coordination is constantly becoming complex, the issue of the function of the network organization and its impact on business performance is now becoming a major issue for both: companies and Economic researches. This led us to propose, as a first step, a method for analyzing the transformations and the management of this network company. We adhere to the hypothesis that success and cohesion of this contemporary organization are based on the mobilization of different modes of coordination. In a second step , we will seek to contribute to a better theoretical understanding of a network company . We will show that if approaches of contact and approaches that are based on skills offer new analytical forms compared to the classical theory, they are still unable to take into account the complexity of a company network. We suggest, moreover, that the approach of knowledge brings an innovative and satisfying synthesis. In a third step, we will study from a micro- econometric point of view and based on the method of matching, the causality between a network organization characterized by the implementation of certain organizational innovations and the performance of companies. The available data are from matched survey data IOC 2006 and based DIANE data. We will show that the application of new management practices induce negative effects on the value added and profitability of financial capital and induce no effect on turnover and labor productivity."
"Entrepreneurial activity is very limited in Tunisia in spite of the effort that the government is making in order to help people create their business. These efforts are implied in the development of support structures. As these structures have existed in Tunisia since 2001, we need to assess the success of their intervention. Indeed, in order to evaluate this intervention, we have, in the first part of our research, presented these structures (chapter I). We mobilized the social capital (chapter II), the 3 E mod-el’s (Paturel 1997) so as to expose the incubation process (chapter III), and also the 3 F mod-el’s (Paturel 2007) which helped us introduce the performance criteria that we used to realize this evaluation (chapter IV). In our second part, we implemented the evaluation of Tunisian support structures by adopting an eclectic approach combining a qualitative and quantitative analysis (chapter I). Our results show that Tunisian entrepreneurs aren’t satisfied with the services provided by these structures and that only two support organizations out of thirteen are prosperous (chapter II). By proposing an evaluation grid (chapter III), we tried to suggest some recommendation as a remedy for this situation (chapter IV)."
"Cities are the host of people as well as government officials, decision-makers, economic and academic elite institutions. Therefore, it is not possible to having any plan without understanding of urban systems can be made. Regardless of the importance of this matter, governments of developing countries often neglect their responsibilities and duties with regards to the city. This work is a combination of Spatial Economic and macroeconomics. Spatial Economic has been defined as identifying and analyzing the performance of the people in a same geographic location.In this paper, first step is introducing the phenomenon of urbanization and urban systems and then, next aim is estimating the Zipf and Gibrat’s laws and Spatial GINI Coefficient for the case of Iran and France. The urban growth model for Iran and France is measured based on the Henderson theories.In this paper, after introducing the phenomenon of urbanization and urban systems, we estimated the Zipf's and Gibrat lows and Spatial GINI' Coefficient for the case of Iran and France. By using the Henderson theories we measured the urban growth model for Iran and France"
"This research focuses on the engagement of organizations for the benefit of non-profit activities, today, in France.This work was conducted within a reference to the research of Boltanski and Thévenot on justification and commitment (Boltanski and Thévenot, 1991; Thévenot, 2005) called “Economies of Worth”. This sociological approach of “action” tries to explain how people justify their actions and what they say about why they engage.From these frames of reference, we propose a model that reflects the empirical practices of professionals in fundraising and organisations involved in building an agreement around philanthropy.This model highlights the devices and equipment being used to build the agreement. It illuminates on what is a “fair and legitimate” action for the general interest. It offer a mechanism to explain how these actions are judged by the stakeholders of organizations involved in a patronage.Our research has two applications in management:1. Identify actions for non-profit organisations to raise funds from organizations who wish to involve in public good.2. Understand of business engagement for the public good. Highlight good practices and benefits that companies can expect of their commitmentOur work brings a specific contribution to understanding the creation of value in a strategic marketing approach of corporate social responsibility, and the development of corporate social capital of public and private organizations acting for the benefit of general interest."
"The urbanization of Information Systems (IS) is an efficient approach to control the complexity of the organization. It strengthens the coherence of IS and aligns it with the business strategy which allows leading to the agility. This approach has significant advantages such as reducing Information Technologies (IT) costs, enhancing the IS position in a competitive environment and ensuring the scalability and sustainability of the IS through the integration of technological innovations. Owing to these factors, the urbanization is considered as a strategic business decision. Thus, its embedding becomes a necessity in order to improve the IS practice. However, apprehending the IS success is a complex challenge due to the lack of global standard assessment criteria of the Urbanized IS (UIS). Commonly, the IS must be appropriate to satisfy user needs and to generate organizational benefits. In this context, the aim of this work is to introduce conceptual framework that enables the evaluation of the IS success after the embedding of urbanization process. This study provides a quantitative empirical validation of the success of UIS and identifies important aspects that influences the perception of the use and net benefits of UIS. The findings present an exploratory validation of urbanization success. The proposed model for the evaluation of UIS has been empirically tested on survey data. The empirical tests highlight the significant causal relationships between UIS constructs such as Quality and use, User Satisfaction and Net Benefits. This work is an ambition attempt to understand and study of the dynamics of change of the existing IS to an UIS."
"While mutations accelerate and instability seems to be permanent, entrepreneurship is valued by public and private actors. In France, the auto-entrepreneur, created by Law No. 2008-776 of 4 August 2008, promotes access to entrepreneurship to greater numbers. Since 2009, the auto-entrepreneurs account for more than half of self-employed entrepreneurs. Also, the existence of a specific entrepreneurial approach to business creation projects under this status arises. This research is part of a constructivist approach to explain the phenomenon by identifying the characteristics of auto-entrepreneurs in comparison to other entrepreneurs. It is rooted in the examination of 700 projects evaluated in upstream phase of the creation / buyout in the southern Finistère, from late 2008 to early 2012, almost 1% of the creation / buyout firms on the Brittany area. The support of entrepreneurial paradigms leads to closer generic theoretical standard to findings from the field. A counterfactual approach identifies the characteristics of auto-entrepreneurs in comparison to other entrepreneurs. Thematic qualitative analysis of biographical interviews of auto-entrepreneurs triangulates and confirms the results. The research questions the paradigm of creating / obtaining new or existing value. She questions the Schumpeterian process of creative versus destructive innovation, and its possible mobilization in a reading of the success of the auto-entrepreneur. It offers effectual approach creation depending on the status of auto-entrepreneur. It confirms the role of the accompanying upstream phase of the creation / buyout business."
"In recent years, electric vehicles have come to the forefront of public transport policies. They are seen as remedy for various pressing public concerns and are thus increasingly benefiting from supportive policy measures. Such measures remain contested: their impact on actual vehicle uptake rates, their sustainability, usefulness and justification are far from being self-evident. This study aims at uncovering the effect of financial demand-side public policy measures on i) the uptake rate of electric vehicles among private households in France, and ii) the public budget. First, the context within which electric vehicles are to evolve is sketched. A comprehensive overview of the potential opportunities that come with the introduction of electric vehicles is given. An international policy review depicts public policy levers that are currently deployed in order to support the uptake of electric vehicles. A focus is put on financial demand-side measures. Preliminary conclusions on their effectiveness with regards to observed electric vehicle uptake rates in the various countries reviewed are drawn. Next, the potential market for electric vehicles among French households is explored. Besides financial aspects, socio-economic obstacles to electric vehicle uptake among private households are analysed. With the aid of scenario analysis that accounts for the many uncertainties with regards to future vehicle developments, costs and market trends, a forecast of the electric vehicles' potential up until 2023 is given. The applied disaggregate approach based on the database of the French National Transport Survey 2007/2008 allows identifying the most promising sets of financial public policy measures that are likely to guarantee certain electric vehicle uptake rates over the next decade. Lastly, the effect of replacing one conventional vehicle by one electric vehicle on the public budget is investigated. Both, vehicle manufacture and use aspects are considered. The set up valuation model hereby accounts for direct and indirect financial impacts on the public budget. These comprise direct purchase subsidies, tax breaks, and tax income, as well as effects of changing employment situations that alter the amount of social contributions and unemployment benefits .The study's findings and considerations allow for various suggestions for vehicle manufacturers and policy makers willing to support the uptake of electric vehicles. These are listed in the conclusions section which also sketches directions for further research"
"This dissertation consists of three articles, examining the performance of demutualized securities exchanges from 2000 to 2011, in view of changes in governance and regulation. The first part is an empirical study of the influence of each type of shareholder (financial investor, broker, strategic or widely-held shares). The results show that fragmented  owner ship is correlated with lower performance and investment managers’ presence with higher performance; strategic investors are on balance detrimental to shareholder value. The second article looks at the same exchanges individually, through case studies. The findings of the first article are validated.However,a closer look at strategic investors shows three outcomes : when they consist of founders, they increase shareholder value; when they are employed managers,they decrease it; and when the strategic investor is a competitor, the target company’s performance becomes more volatile. The third article looks at the combination of technology and regulation.Through mean comparisons and a difference-in-differences approach, this section shows that recent market deregulation has allowed high-tech start-ups to challenge the dominance of the established exchanges, just like previous coincidences of regulatory and technological change resulted in significant market up heavals: the disappearance of London’s jobbers following Big Bang and the Eurocurrency market displacing New York as a major center for dollar borrowing and lending. This dissertation introduces two new concepts: “quasi-agent principals”(shareholders who destroy value in their investment as a result of their conflicts of interest) and the “adjuvant effect” (when the combined effect of regulation and technology is a multiple of the effects of each)."
"In this thesis, by being motivated from the challenges in perinatal networks, we address design, evaluation and flow control of a stochastic healthcare network where there exist multiple levels of hospitals and different types of patients. Patients are supposed urgent; thus they can be rejected and overflow to another facility in the same network if no service capacity is available at their arrival. Rejection of patients due to the lack of service capacity is the common phenomenon in overflow networks. We approach the problem from both strategic and operational perspectives. In strategic part, we address a location & capacity planning problem for adjusting the network to better meet demographic changes. In operational part, we study the optimal patient admission control policies to increase flexibility in allocation of resources and improve the control of patient flow in the network. Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of the network, we develop new approximation methodologies that estimate the rejection probabilities in each hospital for each arriving patient group, thus the overflow probabilities among hospitals. Furthermore, an agent-based discrete-event simulation model is constructed to adequately represent our main applicationarea: Nord Hauts-de-Seine Perinatal Network. The simulation model is used to evaluate the performance of the complex network and more importantly evaluate the strength of the optimal results of our analytical models. The developed methodologies in this thesis are combined in a decision support tool, foreseen under the project “COVER”, which aims to assist health system managers to effectively plan strategic and operational decisions of a healthcare network and evaluate the performance of their decisions."
"This thesis is focused on dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) models and theirapplications to traffic assignment. It aims at providing a mathematically rigorous and general formulation for the DUE. Particular attention is paid to the representation of transport demand and more specifically to trip scheduling and users with heterogeneous preferences.The DUE is first expressed as a Nash game with a continuum of players.  It strongly relies on up-to-date results from mathematical economics. This formulation allows to prove an existence result for DUE. This results notably applies to one of the simplest dynamic user equilibrium model, where users are homogeneous and departure time choice is not allowed.Then, two simple DUE models for which the solutions can be derived analytically are presented. The first one is a generalization of the Vickrey's bottleneck model. Whereas Vickrey assumed that the distribution of preferred arrival time is S-shaped, we consider more general distributions.  In the second model, we have a two-route tolled network where users are continuously heterogeneous with respect to their value of time. This allows us to conduct a study on the relative efficiencies of various pricing strategy and how it is affected by the level of heterogeneity in users' value of time.Finally, a computable model is designed and corresponding solution methods are proposed. A test on the french national road network is conducted. The model is used to assess an hypothetical time-varying pricing scheme intended to ease summer traffic congestion"
"This thesis develops an integrated framework to investigate the impact of the spatial dimension of the economy on the energy use from the transportation and buildings sectors, and on associated carbon emissions. The developed framework consists of five methodological steps based on econometric and quantitative approach. First, a meta-analysis is carried out to pool information across existing studies and yield new and preliminary economic insights. It is shown that spatial organization of economic activities and agents is significantly positively associated with the demand on energy for transport (Chapter 1). Next the causal impact of space on energy consumption is estimated using cross section data for the French households and further decomposed into specific determinants of the energy demand for both transport- (Chapter 2) and buildings- (Chapter 3) related activities. The econometric framework is then extended to account for the longitudinal (dynamic) dimension of the relation between space and sectoral energy use via the long-term impact of housing price on domestic transport demand (Chapter 4). Including information on housing price formation and dynamics allows encompassing broader welfare effects of spatial planning and policy than pure environmental ones. Finally, the set of determinants identified in the previous steps of the analysis are then embedded in a computable general equilibrium framework to assess the role of space and spatial planning as additional leverage to carbon pricing scheme for climate change control (Chapter 5). In the face of the energy and climate challenges ahead, this thesis quantitatively concludes in favor of taking broad and coordinated action. This comes down to identifying the available (market-based and/or regulatory) policy instruments and using them to achieve ambitious targets whilst driving down the cost of action"
"This thesis develops and discusses agricultural-supply modeling approaches for representing the adaptation of farming to global changes and water policies: their effects on agricultural economics and water resources comprise critical information for decision makers. After a summary and a review chapter, four essays are presented. The first essay describes a representation of the behavior of ten typical farms using a risk linear programming model connected to a plant-soil-hydrodynamic model chain, to assess the future level of nitrate contamination in the upper Rhine valley aquifer. The baseline, liberal, and interventionist scenarios for 2015 all result in lower nitrate concentrations. The second essay explores the effects of the economic uncertainty of global changes by means of a Monte Carlo approach distinguishing various levels of dependence on uncertain parameters. Analyses for a nitrate-oriented and a water-use model (in Alsace and southwestern France) show that the environmental objectives can be targeted withsufficient confidence. The third essay develops a flexible specification for positive mathematical programming - constant elasticity of substitution with decreasing returns - to explore how irrigated farming adapts to increased water scarcity in Beauce, France. The possibility of adjusting the application of water per hectare accounts for about 20% of the response. The last essay presents the development of a holistic hydro-economic model of Beauce’s agriculture and aquifer under climate-change uncertainty, so as to evaluate various water policies, as well as the open-access case, up to the year 2040. The results show that the baseline policy is more cost-effective than the other instruments tested (tax, transfer,etc.)."
"This thesis concerns the economic modelling of the politics of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We explore, with a hybrid model, the consequences of the passage of an economy of the climate change under tightened by an exogenous vision of the technical progress at a frame where it is led by all the economic signals. The results underline the risks of fork towards very intensive reference trajectories in carbon. The scenarios with climatic politicsdemonstrate the existence of a gap enter the optimism which was attached to the induction of the technical progress by the climatic politics and the results which we obtain. This thesis suggests finally conceiving the climatic politics more as a joint of specific measures than as"
"The purpose of this thesis is to empirically assess, through the use of novel and econometrically robust approaches, the drivers of school attendance, the role of informality in school dropout, and the linkages between youth work and productivity in small firms. First, we are interested in determining how important the private returns to education are in Venezuela. To this matter, we construct a pseudopanel data by means of the repeated cross-sections from the household survey. The drawback of using pseudo-panel data is the high presence of measurement errors. We address this issue through the use of consistent instrumental variables estimators based on sample moments of order higher than two. Second, we seek to understand the causes of school dropout in secondary education in Venezuela. The econometric approach consists in eliminating the endogeneity bias by using Mundlak corrections, since there is neither a good instrument nor can fixed-effects estimators be used in this estimation. Our contribution for school dropout's literature is twofold. First, the inclusion of informality (informal worker parents) as one of the main factorsffecting the likelihood of children completing high school. Second, the use of recent panel data in assessing the problem of early high school dropouts, provides new and more robust insight into Venezuela's educational bottlenecks. Finally, we analyzethe affect of the share of young workers on small unregistered firms' productivity in Brazil. We use the method of Instrumental Variable in order to ensure that our results are not biased."
"To provide an answer to the issue of this thesis which examines the relevance of the financing model of the private equity, this work is divided into four parts. In the first, we analyze the foundations of the private equity business. We study the organizational structure of the activity and its determinants. The second part focuses on economic integration issues of the private equity. We show that this financial activity is a net creator of jobs and it enhances the competitiveness and economic resilience of firms. The third part deals with the relationship of cause and effect between private equity and the subprime crisis. We show, first that the private equity has not played a key role in the origin and development of this crisis and, secondly, that the regulatory reforms of the sector lead to changes in the distribution of its flows both in terms of business segments that in geographical centralization. The fourth part examines the relationship between private equity inflows in a country and its exchange rate. We show that the undervaluation of a currency increases its attractiveness for private equity deals. This thesis emphasizes, therefore, the fundamental role of private equity transactions in the economy and the impact of policy changes on a country private equity's inflows."
"In this PhD. thesis titled “Exchange Rate Regimes and Economic Performances in Sub-Saharan Africa”, we carried out analysis to show the relationship between the choice of exchange rate regimes and economic performances in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In order to proceed to comparative analysis, first we breakdown the global sample (SSA) into two, which are the monetary union countries or CFA franc zone countries (ZCFA) and the non-monetary union countries or countries outside CFA franc zone (HZCFA), then we breakdown the sample into four subsample, which are the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries, the Central Africa Economic and Monetary Community (CAEMC) countries, the HZCFA countries with fixed exchange rate regimes and the HZCFA countries with flexible exchange rate regimes. Our analysis focuses on the following topics:1. Exchange rate regimes and monetary policies in SSA2. Convergence between WAEMU and CAEMC3. Exchange rate regimes and macroeconomic instabilities in SSA4. Exchange rate regimes, Real exchange rate and its adjustment in SSA5. Exchange rate regimes, macroeconomic instabilities and economic  growth in SSAThe empirical results based on topics mentioned above conducted to mixed results depending on our subsamples. Also, they show that the exchange rate regimes have not been well managed in SSA, and that they have been sometimes used as means to hide bad economic results induced by non-effective economic policies and non-effective economic decisions."
"An efficient market gives the right price of any product, with exchanged quantities, reflecting the value given by sellers and buyers. This value is defined as objective, or intrinsic in classical economic approach. This intrinsic value may be disconnected from a social value. It means there is a problem to define the value especially on financial markets. On those financial markets, value is what has to be measured, subjectively on a value scale given by the market leader. This leader is the winner of a fight, called agôn, and its stock price is growing (agonistic effect), the quantities of stocks exchanged are dropping (allegiance effect), with a high kurtosis (mimetic effect). We could propose to any investor some decision-making aid through an agonistic value theory."
"Processes of transferring managerial knowledge is made in a project of public-private partnership PPP on the strategy adopted by the public partner face the need for acquisition of knowledge in a goal to provide a public high quality service and to have a managerial autonomy after contract’s completion.The Algerian public enterprises, partnership situation with their foreign counterparts, knowledge transfer’s results are depending on the learning capacity of this knowledge by the public partner to acquire, integrate within the organization and use them. They are also a function of the transmission capacity of the private partner to facilitating the transfer through knowledge’s codification according to the following criteria: the strategic intent, trust and transparency and mutual willingness knowledge’s sharing in a cooperative relationship."
"The public sector plays a major role in society. In most developing countries, public expenditure represents a significant part of gross domestic product (GDP) and public sector entities are substantial employers and major capital market participants. The public sector determines, usually through a political process, the outcomes it wants to achieve and the different types of intervention. How the public sector achieves results matters as its size and economic significance make it a major contributor to growth and social welfare. Its achievements emerge in the quality and nature of its financial management, the infrastructure it finances and the quality of its social and economic regulation. How well those public sector activities deliver their expected outcomes is a key development variable; yet explicit evidence base for understanding what works and why in the public sector remains strikingly limited compared with other policy areas. There are two main reasons for this situation: the performance in these areas is difficult to analyze because the outputs of many such services are hard to measure or even to define, and the lack of quantitative and qualitative longitudinal data precludes rigorous econometric analysis.Therefore the objective of this thesis is to document this literature and to propose different ways of measuring public sector performance in developing countries. The dissertation is divided into two Parts: the first Part – Chapters 1 and 2 – presents two essays on “upstream” public sector performance while the second Part – Chapters 3 and 4 – presents two essays on “downstream” public sector performance. The Chapter 1 makes use of the Blinder-Oaxaca Decomposition to examine how the quality of budget institutions affects fiscal performance – Primary Balance and Public Debt – in sub-Saharan Africa. In Chapter 2 we use a Synthetic Control Approach to investigate the impact of Semi-Autonomous Revenue Authorities (SARAs) on revenue mobilization in twenty developing countries. The chapter 3 provides a first systematic Benchmarking of Africa’s infrastructure performance on four major sectors: electricity, water and sanitation, information and communication technologies, and transportation. Finally we evaluate the effects of the establishment of an Independent Regulatory Authority (IRA) on electricity sector performance in developing countries in Chapter 4."
"We investigate whether tt is salient to çonsider the concept of ""cultural diversity"" (CD) and/or ""social capital"" (SC) as explanatory factors of organisations' and  territories' innovative capacity (IC). The starting point of our demonstration is Reagans & Zuckerman's article (2001), who shows that at the level of work groups, CD does not have a direct impact on IC but rather an indirect impact, mediated by two variables of SC cohesion and external range. We propose that the concept of ""bonding-and-bridging social capital""' (BBSC)- combination of the two SC variables- constitutes a salient explanatory factor of work group's IC. Through  an interdisplinary literature review we show how and why this more complex pattern interaction can be extended at the level of organisation, territories, and territory -industry (Tl). We carry out two empirical analyses to test our hypotheses. The first study concerns Tl level. lt uses EPO patent date to reconstitute the co-inventor's network of 85 Tls of the EUI5 in the electric equipment industry. We evaluate BBSC and IC in each TI, and we test their interaction econometrically. Result.s confirm the existence of a positive impact of BBSC on Cl, and show thal cohesion stimulates the quantity or patents, while extemal range stimulate the sustainable  and collective orientation of patents. The second analysis concerns organisation level. It uses a set of unique data collected from 104 French SMEs. Results broodly confirm our hypotheses although the empiricaI frame allows to test only a small part of the model."
"Companies showed the arising of the Open Innovation concept as an amazing opportunity to improve their innovation process and increase profitability. Indeed, Open Innovation proposes to solicit external environment to acquire new technologies thanks to collaborations and, also, to add value to internal technologies by different path, like licensing-out, for instance. Then, firm boundaries become porous to allow strong interactions with external stakeholders. Despite to promises of this concept, it brings a lot of specific issues as intellectual property, firm culture or cognitive brakes. According to our industrial partner, our field observation and our state of art, we focused this work on organizational issues to perform an Open Innovation policy. To solve these issues, first, this these proposes a conceptual model to anchor an organization into it environment and to fully encompass the Open Innovation paradigm. We base our model on the next assumption: environment is composed by influence factors which impact projects of organization and these projects have to own an appropriate capital competence to master the factors and reach the purposes. Thanks to this conceptual framework, we modeled an organization with a mathematic cost/benefits approach to understand the functioning of an organization with « open » policy. Then, we highlighted the role of organizational structure and strategy to perform Open Innovation. Finally, we developed a decision-making tool, RO²I (Relevant Organization for Open Innovation). The objective of this tool is to help project manager to take into account the collaborations to lead his project at t=0 and to choose a suitable organization to anchor his project and acquire external competences. We tested our proposal on past project in an innovation team. After the validation, we verified the usability of our tool in industrial context. We experiment our tool on two projects into shared services of Solvay. We conclude this work on the necessity to anchor a project into a suitable organization for collaboration and on the necessity of a decision-making tool to take into account Open Innovation. For further researches based of our work, we propose to use RO²I to measure the capacity to Open Innovate of a firm"
"Shipping lines are maritime carriers who on occasion implement handling terminals, hinterland transport services and inland terminals in order to improve their competitiveness. These courses of action are developed in different ways but every shipping line hopes to develop a competitive advantage on the market invested. The thesis aims to answer two questions: what are the determining factors for the different forms taken by the enlargement of scopes of shipping lines? Do these differences have an impact on the competitive advantage of the shipping lines? A theoretical framework mixing concepts in proximity economics and strategic management has been built and tested on the North Range. The reasons why Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM and NYK implement different port and hinterland services, compared to other carriers, have been analysed. The competitiveness triggered by these enlargements of scopes has been analysed. Besides the industry-firm-territory logic, competitive dynamics between shipping lines on one hand, and between territories (port and its hinterland) on the other hand, impact the way carriers implement their port hinterland services. The competitive advantage triggered depends on the temporal dynamic of the services implemented. The sustainability of these advantages depends on the density and connexity of port hinterland services developed"
"The member countries of the WAEMU (West African Economic and Monetary Union) decided in 1994 to coordinate their actions in the areas of environment and energy. Inspired by the theory of Optimal Monetary Area (OMA), which contemplates the formation of a monetary union, the thesis examines the homogeneity of the countries in terms of growth and environment in order to establish whether the WAEMU countries must adopt common policies. The first part examines the relationship between growth and environment in static and dynamic frameworks. Then the second part analyzes the causal relationship between the variables GDP - energy - CO2 for each country on the one hand and the symmetry of shocks between countries on the other. The results show that the growth - environment relationship is quite positive and that the shocks are asymmetric. Ultimately, the thesis concludes with a strong heterogeneity of the countries of the area and it is therefore more appropriate at this time to develop a strategy in terms of objectives for growth and limiting pollution."
"French competitiveness clusters are an important tool of French industrial policy, they aim to develop open and collaborative innovation, growth and employment. These clusters are an atypical form of innovation organization. Studies and evaluations highlight the positive eﬀects of French competitiveness clusters on employment. These studies were conducted with an analytical framework which does not allow taking into account accurately and appropriately the eﬀect of clusters. This thesis proposes to measure the eﬀects of clusters on employment from an original analytical framework. This framework, based on a microeconomic approach at ﬁrm level, considers the network and cooperative characteristics of French clusters. This evaluation measures the direct impact of ﬁrms participation into clusters projects on their employment performances and wage dynamics. From panel data, a Diﬀerence-in-Diﬀerences model is used to test the eﬀect of the ﬁrm participation in clusters projects on the dynamics of employment and wages between 2004 and 2010, compared to companies which remained outside the clusters. Average total manpower increases by 31 jobs in ﬁrms which took part in a collaborative R&D project, compared to companies outside clusters, all things being equal. Clusters allowed the creation of 20 115 jobs, including 8 428 managerial and R&D jobs. French competitiveness clusters have a positive impact on managerial and R&D jobs, but not on workers’ jobs. In addition, clusters aﬀect payroll for ﬁrms participating in R&D projects. The payroll increased by 11,3% for ﬁrms which participated in an R&D project between 2004 and 2010, relative to ﬁrms which remained outside clusters. Cooperative and network features of R&D networks explain these dynamics of employment and wages. The wealth of ﬁrms social capital (number of social links) negatively impacts ﬁrms employment performances. Conversely, the value of social capital companies (diversity of actors in social capital) positively impacts their employment performances. Thus, the multiplication of social links lead ﬁrms to have a large number of resources and a greater incentive to mobilize social links, to the detriment of the recruiting of new employees. However, the diversity of actors can create jobs. This diversity enables ﬁrms to beneﬁt from an environment conducive to trade and new ideas, favourable to R&D projects and employment.These evaluation results show that French competitiveness clusters are job creators and that clusters cooperative and network characteristics have an impact on ﬁrms employment performances."
"The emergence of cloud computing is changing the landscape of the infrastructure supporting IT systems. The originality of cloud computing lies primarily in the offer of a new consumption mode available to consumers: IT resources as a service provided on demand. IT providers that have based their income from products sales (hardware and software licenses) faced a change in their revenue models, and thus have to consider new business models. This research reveals that IaaS provider is defined as cloud operators. They are service aggregator and offer functional infrastructure available on demand available over the network. IaaS providers are building a supplier-partners and product-partners ecosystems to increase the overall value. When consumers sign contract, they declaim all technical issues by transferring them to providers. Service Level Agreement (SLA) becomes the object of transaction between providers and consumers. For the pricing process, rate of use is the basis of cost assessment. We suggest three leverage to IaaS providers in order to increase their share of value added: (1) lower costs through technological innovation, (2) ability to attract and retain customers to have high rate of use, and (3) development of services ecosystem."
"The world trade plays an increasingly important role in countries’ economic evolutions as it has been demonstrated by appearance of the concept of globalization. The occurrence of economic crises modifies the content of commercial relationships. Some aspects of trade liberalization and economic integration of countries are studied here and we have considered their evolutions with respect to the crises. The international trade is studied theoretically and empirically. The theoretical part (first chapter) concerns general definitions, concepts and history of trade and globalization. The empirical analyses (second and third chapters) are related to five European countries (France, Greece, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain) and consider their commercial and economic situations, as well as the effects of crises on them. We have firstly measured the levels of trade openness and financial integration of these countries and then we have specified the effect of the worldwide crisis on their integration level. The linkage between countries’ domestic and foreign deficits has been studied; firstly with a simultaneous analysis of investment impact on the two deficits, and secondly by the analysis of the effects of the variations of exchange rate, unemployment rate and public debt on them. Using these analyses we were able to verify that the countries’ international commercial and financial activities play a significant role in spreading a foreign crisis to a given country."
"Immigrants’ and their descendants’ assimilations are old issues in the economic literature. However, they have mainly been investigated in terms of immigration economic efficiency and discriminations. At the same time, cultural assimilation is a recurrent issue in the public debate and particularly through the concepts of national and cultural identity. The identity theory came out in economics more than a decade ago. It allowed improving the understanding of individuals’ decisions when they define themselves by their belonging to one or more groups to which behaving norms are attached. Thanks to this theory, we explore to what extent cultural identity, seen as the expression of immigrants’ cultural assimilation, allows improving the understanding of socioeconomic inequalities. We first highlight the importance of the family context and the educational attainment for the professional outcomes of first and second generations of immigrants. Then, we analyze the formation of the cultural identity. If ethnic identity diminishes with time since arrival in the host country, it also depends on the way it is measured. We exhibit a negative influence of ethnic identity on employment and voting participation but neutral on the wage level. Finally, thanks to a laboratory controlled experiment, we verify in a more general framework the significant role of group identity on individual behaviors."

It relates to the way in which the women could be interested more in the university careers and take part in the development of the scientific research...
"This thesis explored, in two parts, the macroeconomic impacts of exchange rate regimes (ERR), as well as the recent developments in fiscal policy and fiscal decentralization. Part I has reconsidered the role of ERR and its interplay with fiscal, monetary and tax policy. The first result that emerges (Chapter 1) is that fixed ERR can serve as a credible policy tool for stabilizing fiscal policy. However, this stabilizing effect is conditional upon the inter-temporal distribution of the costs of loose fiscal policy. In assessing the linkage between ERR and crises (banking/financial, currency and debt), Chapter 2 evidenced that the bipolar view is no longer valid, and that, crisis proneness rather depends on the macroeconomic fundamentals (the volatility of private sector credit, the deficit-financing mechanism, and the debt-to-GDP ratio). In Chapter 3, we unveiled a strong relationship between ERR and tax policy. Countries with pegged regimes have greater reliance on domestic taxation -such as the VAT- to make up for the loss of seigniorage revenue (substitution effect). Moreover, peggers tend to collect more VAT revenue to offset the shortfall in cross border taxes following the trade liberalization reform (competitiveness effect). Part II discussed the cyclical response of fiscal policy in high debt periods, and focused on fiscal decentralization issues. In Chapter 4, we showed that the reaction of fiscal policy to the business cycle is non-linear and conditional to the level of public debt. When the debt-to-GDP ratio goes beyond a certain threshold (87%), fiscal policy loses its counter-cyclical properties. Further, we highlighted that carefully-designed fiscal rules help maintaining counter-cyclicality through an ex ante disciplinary effect. Chapters 5 and 6 analyzed the impact of fiscal decentralization on the efficiency of public service delivery and fiscal policy performance, respectively. Chapter 5 revealed that a sufficient level of expenditure decentralization, coupled with revenue decentralization, improves the efficiency of public service delivery. However, the political and institutional environment is critical for reaping decentralization-led benefits. Lastly, Chapter 6 concluded that fiscal decentralization has destabilizing effect by reducing the counter-cyclicality of fiscal policy. In addition, we found that decentralization strengthens the structural fiscal balance; however, vertical fiscal imbalances reduce the benefits of decentralization. It is therefore critical to limit asymmetries between expenditure and revenue decentralization, so as to reduce the transfer-dependency of local governments to the central level, and thus prevent decentralization from weakening the fiscal stance at the general government level."
"In most of the developed societies, in France too, we are now witnessing an increase of the social and economic disparities between regions, an occurrence and persistence of neighborhoods ""in difficulty"", concentrating the most vulnerable populations. ""Spatial segregation"" appears as a norm of urban organization and territory as an issue of social cohesion. Many economic and sociological studies have sought to explain the differentials observed between these populations, particularly in the labor market. Three main mechanisms explain the impact of the place of residence on the individuals' labor market achievement: the spatial mismatch, the social environment and the discrimination based on place of residence. In this doctoral dissertation we focus on this last mechanism through which the place of residence affects the individuals' labor market achievement.  Across three studies covering three chapters, we highlight three important elements in the analysis of discrimination related to place of residence: the feeling of discrimination, wage discrimination and employment discrimination. These are illustrated by different methods: an analysis of subjective survey data, an analysis of objective survey data and, finally, an analysis of experimental data.  The main results are as follows. We have shown that there are specific effects of place of residence on the feeling of discrimination among young people. We have shown that the place of residence has a direct influence on the probability of finding a job after the school as well as on the salary associated with the job. Using a decomposition of wage differentials we have shown that there is a potential discrimination related to the place of residence that affects especially young women. We found a major impact of the residential county on the individuals’ chances of access to hiring. The same effect also exists, more weakly, at the level of the neighborhood reputation. An analysis of the order of answers to job candidates confirmed these results and revealed an even stronger discrimination. On the basis of these results, we propose policy recommendations related to different aspects of discrimination based on place of residence."
"This thesis aims at developing tools and models that are relevant for the study of some spatial risks and risks in networks. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first one is a general introduction containing the state of the art related to each study as well as the main results. Chapter 2 develops a new multi-site precipitation generator. It is crucial to dispose of models able to produce statistically realistic precipitation series. Whereas previously introduced models in the literature deal with daily precipitation, we develop a hourly model. The latter involves only one equation and thus introduces dependence between occurrence and intensity; the aforementioned literature assumes that these processes are independent. Our model contains a common factor taking large scale atmospheric conditions into account and a multivariate autoregressive contagion term accounting for local propagation of rainfall. Despite its relative simplicity, this model shows an impressive ability to reproduce real intensities, lengths of dry periods as well as the spatial dependence structure. In Chapter 3, we propose an estimation method for max-stable processes, based on simulated likelihood techniques. Max-stable processes are ideally suited for the statistical modeling of spatial extremes but their inference is difficult. Indeed the multivariate density function is not available and thus standard likelihood-based estimation methods cannot be applied. Under appropriate assumptions, our estimator is efficient as both the temporal dimension and the number of simulation draws tend towards infinity. This approach by simulation can be used for many classes of max-stable processes and can provide better results than composite-based methods, especially in the case where only a few temporal observations are available and the spatial dependence is high"
"It is well known in the enterprises that each new projectto be carried out is usually similar to a certain previous projects. Those projects can be structured according to a common reference process depending on their type. In the dissertation, we call this reference process of the enterprise’s good practices the “expertise business process”. The main difficulty lies in the formalization of the expertise business process. The traditional knowledge capitalization approaches based on the experts’ debriefings showed their limits: the experts often leave out details which may be of relevance because the debriefings are habitually realizedexternally to the activities. Our thesis relies on the idea that it is possible to construct the operational process, implemented during the collaborative activities in a product development study, from the traces recorded by the used IT tools. The constructed operational process allows the business actors and experts to step back on their work and formalize the new deducted experience to enhance the expertise business processes of the firm. Our work had taken place in the ERPI (Equipe de Recherche sur les Processus Innovatifs) laboratory of the “Université de Lorraine” under a partnership with TDC Software society and through a CIFRE Convention. This dissertation offers five key contributions: •	A double cycle to capitalize over the instrumented activities. •	A global approach for the management of expertise business processes. •	An ontology “OntoProcess” to conceive the generic organizational aspects, separating distinctly the concepts related to traces from those related to the business process, and providing extensions in function of the used tools. •	A multi-agents system based on the ontology “OntoProcess” to support the presented global approach of the expertise business processes management. •	A trace based system that allows the construction of the operational process from the traces registered over the study"
"Through its multidimensionality, energy access actively contributes to the achievements of several Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and especially MDG3 which aims at promoting gender equity and women empowerment. Lack of access to energy is a major issue for women in rural areas since it limits their choices in their daily activities and, therefore, undermines their development and their empowerment. This statement is at the core of the creation of the concept of the multifunctional platform (MFP). MFPs are a set of equipment which provides energy services. The basic version of MFPs comprises a diesel engine turning a mill, a husker and an electric alternator which furnishes electricity. In Burkina Faso, the Programme National Plates-formes Multifonctionnelles pour la Lutte Contre la Pauvreté (PN-PTFM/LCP) was launched in 2005. A household survey with two rounds (2009 and 2011) have been implemented in order to analyze the impact of the MFP program on woman and child living conditions, and in order to determine if MFP are a good way to contribute to achieving the MDGs in Burkina Faso.  Instrumental variable and double difference analyses lead in this thesis conclude that MFPs enable to reduce the daily time dedicated to domestic tasks for some women. For these women, this time saved is reinvested in creating income generating activities. By contract, little evidence has been found regarding positive externalities on child education and health. Thus, the MFP program only partially contributes to achieving the MDGs related to woman well-being, since the positive effects only concern some women. Concerning the MDGs related to child health and education, the MFP program doesn’t seem to have the expected results. We consider that these mixed results of the MFP program in Burkina Faso are mainly due to repeating technical problems, and to the weak degree of multifunctionality of the MFPs."
"Atmospheric emissions from shipping was for a long time ignored, but have begun to attract an increasing amount of interest in recent years, with policies elaborated at different levels to reduce air pollutants (sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulate matters) and greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide). Regulated by international law in reference to Annex VI of MARPOL Convention adopted by member states of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), emissions from shipping are also subject to specific measures by the European Union. This thesis aims to answer the following question: can policies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants from ships alter the supply of maritime liner services? We show how emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants from ships are a complex and unique public policy issue and analyse the policy-making processes that have shaped the development of the various policies. We demonstrate that the specific format of public policy instruments (regionalisation of rules, set objectives with choice of means left to companies, etc.), as well as the articulation of the various policies and their development over time make the consideration of these policies by shipowners truly strategic, in the sense that it goes beyond the traditional compliance with prescriptive security and environmental norms. We then highlight, through two case studies, the possible strategic choices faced by shipowners, both technical and organisational in nature, as well as the consequences of these choices on the supply of maritime liner services: the first case study looks at roro transport in the English Channel while the second examines international container shipping between Europe and Asia. We highlight not only the differing effects of emission reduction policies on short sea shipping and deep-sea shipping markets, but also what they have in common with respect to changes in shipping services. It appears that emission reduction policies favour certain changes in supply in conjunction with other factors but that they do not necessarily trigger such changes"
"This thesis focuses on the analysis of knowledge transfer in the context of a subcontracting relationship between a prime contractor and subcontractor SMEs. It aims, in particular, to study the factors that influence this transfer and its implications in terms of improving managerial practices for the subcontractor and for the contractor as well. To do so, we conducted an empirical analysis in two stages: an experts's survey for the contextualization of research and a study of four case studies in the Moroccan automotive sector. This research highlights the specificities of the Moroccan context regarding the determinants of this process and underlines the need to incorporate factors related to the economic and institutional environment in the analysis of interorganizational knowledge transfer. Our analysis highlights the importance of middle management and desorption capacity in knowledge transfer success between contractors and subcontractor SMEs."
"Two behavioral motivations have been identified for overinvestment: agency conflict (Jensen, 1986) and overconfidence (Heaton, 2002). While the literature on overconfidence and overinvestment studies one of these motivations, with regards to agency related overinvestment, extant literature tends to focus on financial characteristics and control mechanisms to explain the phenomenon. However, such factors influence the act of overinvestment only indirectly through affecting the opportunity to overinvest. Based on literature we can establish that culture influences the opportunity to overinvest through the institutional environment in which the company operates, and the cultural influence on some of the techniques used to mitigate overinvestment at the company level. We posit that culture exerts a more direct influence on overinvestment in affecting management’s decisions to move from the opportunity to the act of overinvestment in capital expenditures. To empirically verify our assertion we construct a sample of 1,550 quoted, non-financial, potential overinvestor firms from 36 countries for the period between 2001 and 2011. We find that higher masculinity and uncertainty avoidance in a culture leads to more overinvestment. We believe that our findings, besides advancing understanding of the behavioral drivers of overinvestment, lend support to those who question the cross-cultural transferability of agency theory."
"The consequences of adverse aggregate shocks on households have been repeatedly documented, but far less has been said on the way they are passed over to individuals through the mediation of the household. Does the household contribute in mitigating the effects? Or does the economic shock rather invite itself at the family negociating table? Using the Argentine 2001 economic crisis as a natural experiment, I first show that married women are more likely to enter the labor market if their husband experienced a loss in income, giving credit to the insurance mechanism. Then, I show that the business cycle matters for investments in education, and that long run labor outcomes of Argentine men are persistently affected by the initial conditions upon graduation. Finally, I consider the “Mancession” dimension of the Great Recession in Spain and demonstrate that the resource share accruing to wives for own consumption increases together with the decreasing unemployment gap, which comes in support to the bargaining hypothesis."
"This thesis examines the macroeconomic consequences of capital and external financial flows in developing countries. While the first part of the thesis focuses on the economic effects of external flows, the second and third parts of the thesis analyse the distributional repercussions. Having focused on the measurement and concepts that may influence the movement of the exchange rate (ER) (Chapter 1), the thesis reveals a set of results. First, foreign direct investment (FDI) and workers remittances are favourable in MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. However, official flows; portfolio flows and border bank loans confirm the Dutch disease mechanism. The presence of institutional quality mitigates the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate (REER) (Chapter 2). Second, after analysing the methodological difficulties of the empirical study (Chapter 3), the results confirm that the assumptions of Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson do not corroborate with the real world. Trade openness is not pro-poor in developing countries. The lack of robustness of capital and external flows on income shares requires a deep analysis and lead to the third part of the thesis (Chapter 4). Third, on the one hand, remittances are pro-poor when the representative migrant is issued from a poor family, living in a rich country or in a low brain drain country and in low passport costs country. On the other hand, remittances are pro-rich when the money transfer costs are high, this reflects the use of the informal channels at the expense of formal channels (Chapter 5). Development aid is pro-rich in democratic countries and pro-poor in middle income countries (less aid dependent countries)."
"Over the last twenty years, most European cities have had to face a new and unforeseen phenomenon, a reduction in the consumption levels of urban technical networks (and in particular water systems). The reasons for this phenomenon are numerous, from technical improvements of domestic appliances and deindustrialisation to changes in behaviours of users and the development of policies promoting sobriety and moderation in the use of natural resources. This is however a symptom of a larger process rather than a process per se. Indeed, declining consumption levels reveal the slow decay of the traditional model of management of urban networks, which has long relied on increasing demand associated with perpetual extension of the network. The erosion of this model is forcing network operators to confront a new form of vulnerability, which I term infrastructural vulnerability, the effects of which touch all components of a network, from users to pipes through operators and regulators. The thesis argues that this changing consumption regime is no single interlude, but rather constitutes the emergence of a new mode of network management. As such, it can be interpreted as an infrastructural bifurcation, i.e. a radical and durable transformation of network management as a means of adaptation to this regime of shrinking demand. To deal with this challenge, urban technical network operators have had to adapt and decided to transform both their business model and their territorial base. In order to grasp the rationales of these changes, I opted for a methodology involving being embedded for several months within two local firms facing this issue of diminished consumption with differing levels of intensity. The first is a multi-utility in the eastern part of Germany (Städtische Werke of Magdeburg), while the second is a water and sanitation operator in the south of Spain (EMASESA in Sevilla).My approach combines contributions from Science and Technology Studies (STS), urban political ecology and work on urban shrinkage to reveal that an emerging model of network management is yet to be fully stabilised, but that common adaptation strategies can be observed in both the cases. These strategies are not limited to technical adjustments or tariff increases to compensate the losses due to non-consumed volumes. The transformation in management model relies not only on major technical changes (such as downsizing, resizing or recentralisation of the network), but also on organisational shifts and new relations and arrangements between users and operators. Network operators have thus modified their role to become more than only suppliers of fluids. Their new business model has consequently reoriented production of value towards the development of services for users and the downstream part of the sector. This shift has a spatial dimension, as operators are also experiencing a form of rescaling of their management. The search for new economies of scale to preserve the stability of their socio-technical systems pushes them to extend their functional territories. This leads to potential conflicts with the local actors of the absorbed territories, but also to new forms of territorial solidarity and spatial redistribution. Systemic transformation thus sketches out a new geography of urban technical networks which advances work on local infrastructure firms and on network evolution by integrating the neglected configuration of a shrinking demand regime"
"In this thesis a different aspects of dependence modeling are considered. Indeed, temporal dependence structures between claims amounts and between lines of business are analyzed. In the  first chapter, a general introduction on modeling dependence in insurance is provided. The second chapter is essentially constituted by the article ""Modeling Temporal Dependence of Claims In Insurance Using Autoregressive Conditional Amount Models"", written with Christian de Peretti and Lotfi Belkacem, (see Araichi et al. (2013)) It deals with the problem of existing a temporal dependence structure between claims amounts of one line of business. To this end, we propose a new model for handling the dynamic behaviour of claims amounts in insurance companies using an Autoregressive Conditional Amount (ACA) framework. This model will be named Autoregressive Conditional Amount Model (ACA). A Gamma ACA model and a Generalized Extreme Value ACA model are proposed. It is shown that these models are more appropriate to describe and to forecast the process of claims of the lines Auto Damage and Auto Liability than traditional models. Furthermore, a parametric Value at Risk based on ACA framework (VaR ACA) is proposed for evaluating a coverage amount of these claims. Using backtesting techniques, the VaR ACA provides an accurate estimation of risk. The third chapter of this thesis is based on the article ""Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality Model: A novel model for claims reserving in Non life insurance"", written with Christian de Peretti and Lotfi Belkacem, (see Araichi et al. (2015)). In this chapter, a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality Model (GACSM) for claims is proposed. We extend the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) by incorporating temporal dependence between claims amounts of one triangle. The GACSM is used for model parameter estimation and consistency of such estimate is proved. Bootstrap procedure is implemented for prediction reserves and prediction errors. Results show that taking into account the temporal dependence between losses improves the precision of the reserve distribution estimate, and thus evaluates an accurate SCR. Finally the fourth chapter is based on the article ""Time Varying Copula Model for claims reserving in Non life insurance"", written with Christian de Peretti and LotfiBelkacem. In this chapter, a time varying copula models to understand the behavior of claims amounts of two lines of business. Time varying copula functions with a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Sinistrality model are used to analyze the evolution in time of dependence between two lines and the temporal dependence between claims of each line. Simulation study is performed to highlight the impact on reserves and Solvency Capital Requirement. Results show that our approach provides a diversification effect between claims amounts"
"We study in this thesis a particular dimension of the packaging: the texture. In the first study (A), composed of three experiments, we present the influence of the texture, in the absence of tactile contact, on attitudes towards a product and consumer choices. We manipulate the texture of the packaging as well as a tactile stimulation previously taking into account the level of the need for touch. We first show that the positive tactile stimulation induces a more positive assessment of the product when it is not textured, regardless of the need for touch. When the product is textured, individuals with a low need for touch have a devaluation of the product. Then we present the influence of negative tactile stimulation on the choice between a product whose packaging is smooth and the other textured. In the absence of tactile stimulation, the product inside the textured packaging is the preferred. Prior negative tactile stimulation leads mainly individuals with a low need for touch to favor the product inside the smooth packaging. In the second study (B), we present the influence of tactile contact with the texture of packaging on the perceived taste of the product. In the first experiment we show that when the texture does not provide information about the product contained, it does not have influence on the perceived taste. When the texture of the packaging induced expectations about the product, the assessment depends on the situation of sensory congruency. If there is a sensory incongruency between the texture of the packaging and the texture of the product during consumption, the taste of the product will be less appreciated. In the second experiment, by using a EEG, we study the effects of sensory congruency between the texture of the packaging and the texture of the product on the emotions of the consumer. We show that sensory incongruency induces a higher level of arousal, but also induces to more negative emotions comparatively to a situation of sensory congruency."
"As global concern about climate increases, road transport energy consumption, given its impact on the environment and its socio-economic role, must evolve to sustainability logic. First, the present work provides an international comparison of the energy intensity and the CO2 intensity in road transport for a group of 90 countries oer the period 1980-2010. Through the calculated Theil coefficient, our empirical findings highlight the existence of spatial and temporal disparities between coustries. In 2010, Tunisia occupies the 48th and the 38th rank respectively in terms of energy and environmental efficiency.Based on a general index of energy performance in the road transport sector, it is deemed to have a medium energy performance by occupying the 34th rank. Secondly, through the adoption of conceptual modeling approach, several indicators for sustainable energy development in road transport sector are constructed. To measure the real transport value added, we used filter Kalman approach. We denote that the informal transport value added is about 61% during the period 1980-2010.Finally, this thesis studies causal mechanisms between indicators for sustainable energy development related to energy consumption from Tunisian road transport sector. The investigation is made using the Johansen cointegration technique and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) approach. It examines the nexus between real transport value added , road transport-related energy consumption, road infrastructure, fuel price, rate of motorization and CO2 emissions from Tunisian transport sector during the same period. Empirical results support the hypothesis of neutrality between energy and income for Tunisian road transport sector, and the hypothesis of an inverted U-shaped EKC for transport CO2 emissions. Also, there is a unidirectional Granger causality running from fuel price to road transport-related energy consumption with no feedback in the short run. In this sense, using price decomposition technique, we refute asymmetric fuel price effect hypothesis. By the introducing of the technological factor, the rebound effect is about 18% in the short run and 51% in the long run. The study shows the importance if enhancing a number of policies for the road transport system through the joint improvement of the fuel price policy, of the road infrastructure policy and of the road vehicles policy. The optimal combination of fiscal, economic and regulatory instruments is the main strategy to achieve these objectives. The energetic governance is necessary in order to maintain sustainable energy road transport."
"Iran as a country dominated by oil exports offers unique insights and rich rewards considering its economic and socio-political environment. Although according to a resource-based analysis this economy has the potential of being the world's 20th strongest economy because of its rich reserves in minerals and other natural resources alongside with country's geo-strategic position. It really seems strange and unbelievable how Iran can remain underdeveloped while having so many rare resources highly appreciated by the rest of the world. How we can explain this incoherence? The classic economic model describing Dutch Disease was developed by the economists W. Max Corden and J. Peter Neary in 1982. The so-called ""Dutch Disease"" as an economic concept explains the seeming relationship between natural resource abundance in a country and decline in other economic sectors specially manufacturing. This theory reveals that an increase in revenues from natural resources will de-industrialize the economy by raising exchange rate, which makes manufacturing sectors to become less competitive. The primary purpose of this paper is to determine if Iranian economy is suffering from this problem and if so what will be the impact of this issue on different sectors economy of Iran. In this paper, using an applied general equilibrium model, and not partial equilibrium model, we analyze Dutch disease in Iranian economy. We use the model that has been made by Dr Lofgren as a base and extend and adjust it for Iran economy. In order to solve the general equilibrium pattern numerically, GAMS software package can be used which is a powerful tool for solving linear and nonlinear equations."
"This research was conducted in order to contribute to the enrichment of knowledge onfinancial inclusion. Starting from the premise that the sustainability of a business depends onits economic balance, whether built on the basis of private, public or mixed resources, wequestioned the relationship between financial inclusion and deprived populations focusing onthe effects of the financial services’ business models, limiting ourselves to the French market.We demonstrate that despite a French regulation, seemingly protective for consumers andinclusive-oriented, current banking models maintain exclusion. Improving the conditions ofaccess to and use of financial services by insecure people is conditioned by developments thatthe market alone cannot organize.We conclude further that measures tested by the Government or the voluntary sector to fightagainst banking exclusion do only match the needs of excluded people for certain profiles, incertain contexts. Moreover, the assumption of the sustainability of their business modelscannot be confirmed.Finally, we argue and justify that, as regards financial services, a sustainable and inclusiveeconomic model is conditioned by socio-economic transformations. The first one refers to theformalization of the access to the currency as a service of general interest, the second onecomes from the rehabilitation of the value of savings.Financial inclusion is not intended to address the problem of resource level, but consideringthe finding of recurring liquidity credit needs, it progresses when offers that avoid damagingthe living conditions of the borrower are spread. This is the objective of the proposed model."

"This phd contributes to the definition of efficiency measures and productivity indicator, in the microeconomic theory. It presents theoretical and empirical contributions. Firstly, this phd develops a review on standard measures of efficiency and productivity. It is shown that the directional measure, under the assumption of constant returns to scale, raises some problems in the assessment of productivity changes. Moreover, it is established that the ""slacks-based"" and directional ""slack-based"" measures (or Färe-Lovell measures) do not allow to characterize  technology. It follows that such measures do not allow to evaluate  efficiency and productivity changes. An alternative approach is proposed which overcomes this difficulty. Then, this phd introduces two new indicators: a social Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen indicator and a generalized indicator of productivity. The first mesure the impact of publics policies in the line of the capability theory introduce by A. Sen. This indicator consists on a transposition of the Hicks-Moorsteen indicator by considering a sub-vector of social factors. The second indicator generalizes  standards productivity indicators. It allows to find the Luenberger and the Luenberger Hicks-Moortsteen as special cases of this general indicator. Considering the multiplicative version of the generalized indicator, on can find the Malmquist and Hicks-Moorsteen indicators, as special cases. Finally, this phd presents some empirical applications to illustrate the methodology. These studies evaluate and compare the performance of the tourist destination, and specifically for the Languedoc-Roussillon, which involves a cross-border analysis framework"
"One of the most important challenges in the current industrial policy of developed and emerging countries is to support innovation in SMEs, issue which has been approach as a problem only dependent on the availability of resources. Innovation capability does not have an appropriate framework of evaluation, mainly because of its complexity and abstract nature. Without proper indicators, it is not possible to establish objectives and identify the efforts and resources necessary for its improvement. In response to this, the ERPI laboratory has developed an evaluation approach of innovation capability, taking into account internal practices to promote innovation. A field of knowledge has been developed in this direction allowing for the proposal of a novel metrology, the Potential Innovation index (PII), based on multi-criteria analysis methods for studying the dynamics within companies.  In this thesis, we propose an optimization model that replicates the evaluation procedure of innovation capability to generate an action plan, i.e., the model returns concrete points in which companies can work to improve its innovation system. The model considers factors such as the particular situation of the company, the economic efforts associated with the proposed strategy, the goals of the entrepreneur, etc. Three optimization strategies are proposed:  access to a higher category with a minimum of effort, maximize resource efficiency and maximize innovation performance with a defined budget. Scenarios are simulated to test the results of the implementation of the different strategies"
"Transport infrastructures are public goods. Their importance is demonstrated in the literature since the seminal works of the endogenous growth theory, new economic geography, as well as empirical studies conducted in several countries. Our research focuses on the transport infrastructure in developing countries with an application to the case of Morocco. This thesis is divided in two parts. The first one highlights the role of transport infrastructure in the economy through a review of theoretical and empirical literature and the presentation of different econometric modeling approaches. Then, we study the case of Morocco by using econometric approach of vector error correction model to analyze the long-term dynamic relationships between GDP, public capital and the causality effects. Then, we demonstrate with an autoregressive model the impact of highway investments on GDP / capita and improving accessibility. The second part of our research focuses on the effects of transport infrastructure on the economic growth of 16 Moroccan regions, and the differences between these regions as a result of road and highway public capital allocation. We follow in our research Charlot (1999), Charlot and Schmitt (2002) on French regions, and Marquez, Ramajo and Hewings (2011) applied on Spanish provinces. After, we study the evolution of urban primacy in Morocco by focusing our analysis to the structural role of transport infrastructure. We use gravity models to explore spatial interactions between Moroccan regions. Finally, we are interested in the region of Tangier in Morocco. We study the case of the Tangier-Med port as transport infrastructure. We analyze the impacts of this port on the economic dynamics of this region and the location of productive activities."
"In this Ph.D. Dissertation we study the storm guarantee dedicated to the damage caused by the wind and a development of the behavioral insurance through the automobile risk. We associate external information like the wind speed to insurance data. We propose the construction of a storm index to complete and strengthen the evaluation of the damages caused by the major storms. Then we define a partition of the French territory in 6 zones storms, depending on extreme wind correlations to test several scenarios. These various tests and considerations allow us to improve our storm index. We lean on extreme value theory models to show the impact of the variability on the calculation of return periods and capital requirements. We underline the difficulties to obtain strong results in connection with the extreme events. Concerning car insurance, we test various methods to answer the technical and legal evolutions. We characterize the man/woman partition by using the logistic procedure, the multiple correspondence analysis or the classification trees. We show that it is possible to compensate for the absence of the sex variable with other information specific to the insurants or to their vehicle and in particular the use of kilometric data. Finally, we are interested in the acquired experience by young drivers. We study the behavior on the road of the insurants to create new classes of risks"
"Handling multidimensional parabolic linear, nonlinear and linear inverse problems is the main objective of this work. It is the multidimensional word that makes virtually inevitable the use of simulation methods based on Monte Carlo. This word also makes necessary the use of parallel architectures. Indeed, the problems dealing with a large number of assets are major resources consumers, and only parallelization is able to reduce their execution times. Consequently, the first goal of our work is to propose ""appropriate"" random number generators to parallel and massively parallel architecture implemented on CPUs/GPUs cluster. We quantify the speedup and the energy consumption of the parallel execution of a European pricing. The second objective is to reformulate the nonlinear problem of pricing American options in order to get the same parallelization gains as those obtained for linear problems. In addition to its parallelization suitability, the proposed method based on Malliavin calculus has other practical advantages. Continuing with parallel algorithms, the last point of this work is dedicated to the uniqueness of the solution of some linear inverse problems in finance. This theoretical study enables the use of simple methods based on Monte Carlo"
"Online marketing is characterized by a loss of control when compared to traditional offline marketing (Mangold & Faulds, 2009). This is mainly due to two reasons. The first is that, on online social networks, communities took control over brands. The second is that online social network (OSN) platforms, mainly Facebook, limit access to information in a way they do not even have access to their list of fans.This dissertation comes at a time where more research and more investigations are needed in the field of strategic marketing on online social networks (Hoffman & Novak, 2012). This is why it attempts to add to theory and practice of viral marketing strategies on OSN and, in particular, initial seeding population. It is an attempt to reestablish equilibrium to the advantage of practitioners in marketing on OSN and increase their margin of manoeuver between a platform that builds barriers to information and a public who considers brands on OSN as intruders of its own space (Fournier & Avery, 2011). We chose the critical approach of Habermas (1985). In this paradigm, knowledge is based on empirical experiments where environment tweaking is allowed.The analysis and experiments in this dissertation follow a theoretical and experimental path that leads to a theoretical and practical thinking that defines strategies and viral marketing optimization methods through the control of viral marketing elements, especially the selection and creation of initial seeding populations.This dissertation consists of several chapters, amongst which a paper currently under third revision at the Journal of Advertising Research (JAR) and four experiments that have been presented at international conferences (Euras, 2012; INSNA, 2014; ISMS, 2015) and the workshop stratégie Paris-Dauphine (2014).This dissertation attempts to answer several questions about the control of viral marketing elements, especially the optimization of initial seeding population, and we think we have found relevant and innovation answers to these questions. We start with a meditation on research on online social networks and, in particular, the ethics of research on the internet and OSN. We then move to the question of uncovering and building social graphs of fans and analyze the efficiency and inefficiency of fake profiles in Facebook marketing. We also consider word-of-mouth in the context of an optimized seeding population, and the discovery of social bridges over structural holes rallying antagonistic political groups, a theoretically optimized seeding population. Those experiments lead to a thinking about the importance of the Facebook channel (pages, groups or personal timelines) and the role it plays with different marketing strategies: mass, relational, niche and, especially, viral.The last chapter puts into practice our findings and results by creating a strategy from zero to success of a personal branding campaign using viral marketing. This experiment is document, analyzed and without bias because it only happens on Facebook and does not use any advertising sources inside or outside this channel. This last experiment shows the efficiency of the viral marketing strategy based on our results, finding and theoretical analysis in this dissertation."
"This thesis explores the financial dimension of export performance, for which we noticed insufficient theoretical developments. Our research consists in two studies. The first one is exploratory and presents a syncretic theoretical model of SMEs export performance determinants (both financial and non financial) in general and in the wine industry. In this study, we also test this model on the export performance (export sales and export intensity) of a sample of French wine companies. Then, by adapting financial theories to exporting, we build a model relating export performance to several financial determinants (financial needs, financial structure and financial constraint) first globally and then according to the export development of SMEs. Export performance is assessed not only through export intensity but also through an innovative financial performance measure. This model has been tested on a sample of 311 exporting SMEs. Analyses confirm the presence of specific financial needs. The financial structure as well as financial constraints evolve according to the level of export performance while a general financial fragility is observed whatever the level of export performance is."
"This work is part of the contribution to the early research in management on the performance of the spin-off policy in Tunisia under the model of ""3F"", and will attempt to update the implications of the spin-off policy forces including the problem of youth employment. To answer the question of research, the author raises the base of understanding of the subject of research from the Tunisian business environment to its scientific protocol that feeds a complex theoretical substrate around the spin / spin-off as support structure is decided politically. To support this thesis, the author shows that surge of Tunisian enterprises has a little overall performance mainly because of the heaviness of its various stages. To set the context of this research, the author pinpoints the major steps that explain the economic and entrepreneurial progress of Tunisia while highlighting the breakpoints. The author has tried, after a qualitative study and a quantitative study, to conceptualize a new model for specific spin process whilst making recommendations to simplify its implemenfation and benefit more from the potential of this business practice in Tunisia."
"This thesis examins the phenomenon of the territorial competitiveness by using optics of the New Economic Geography (NEG). While we think that the regional competitiveness is the capacity of a local economy to attract mobile factors of production, this subject has an increasing importance within a globalized economy. The thesis is structured as follows. The first chapter represents an attempt to position the debate within the framework of NEG. After having chosen a theoretical perspective, in the second chapter we narrow the debate towards the creation of a new definition used as platform for the empirical part. Against this backdrop, the third chapter provides a novel index of regional competitiveness for European regions, a discussion on territorial, temporal and methodological choices, while presenting and interpreting the results in the light of NEG. The results of this chapter question especially the links between territorial competitiveness and national growth rate, and which is why we are discussing in a more detailed fashion the role of policies in managing these processes."
"Since their creation, poles of competitiveness are becoming increasingly important in speeches and research literature. They have emerged as a relevant field of study and even a daily echo in business or the general press which report about changes in management practice within these clusters. Currently this structure, which relatively nascent, focuses on the identification and dissemination of best practices among its actors. The aim of this thesis is to outline a theoretical model of integration of inter-actors trust within the clusters. So, in order to develop this model, we explored a wide array ofliterature dealing with trust, clusters and inter-organization relations. Finally, some issues related to the empirical examination of building trust are discussed. The contribution of this paper lies primarily in its study of the concept of trust in a multilateral context."
"Territory's prosperity and its employment level depend on its ability to attract and keep productive activities. Transports and telecommunications infrastructures are both factors of territories' attractivity (Baranzani et al., 2006). Therefore, the development of transports and telecommunications networks is an important game stake. Economic Geography models have been developed by taking into acount the notion of geographical distance and the transport costs associated. The impact of telecommunications development has not been inserted. Though, we can draw an analogy between transport-economic relation and telecommunication-economic relation. We want to show how transports and telecommunications coexistence is going to modify mechanisms and results of Economic Geography. After making a literature review, we are going to focus on 3 topics coming from Economic Geography. (Chapter 2) : Firms relations and modification of competition process. (Chapter 3) : Structuration and territories' attractivity. (Chapter 4) : Teleworking and territories' competition"
"The thesis presents highly topical macroeconomic imbalances problem and the related twin deficit phenomenon. Innovative distance-based methodology inspired by an algebraic term of the metric space allows to identify sources of the macroeconomic divergence, which are, in our case, the current account and the indebtedness. These factors are responsible for macroeconomic divergence in the world as well as in Europe, which suggests an importance of the twin deficit analysis. Text-mining, analysis of the content and systematic classification of the scientific papers on twin deficits reveal a dominance of the Mundell-Fleming approach and the Ricardian equivalence, confirmed mainly in developed countries. Twin deficit hypothesis in 14 countries of the EU15 in the context of the important public debt is tested by panel data threshold model. The model confirms twin deficit hypothesis only if a public debt-to-GDP ratio is of the range from 40.2% to 96.6%. The Ricardian equivalence is valid in the regime of the public debt-to-GDP higher than 96.6% (threshold model) or 93% (dynamic model explaining an asymmetric impact of the public debt on economic growth). One deficit does not deepen the second one, but efficiency of the expansionary fiscal policy to reestablish an economic growth is importantly reduced at this indebtedness level."
"This thesis concerns the organizational design. Work organization is a special object because it recovers several dimensions of a situation of work. Indeed, at the same time, it relates to the prescribed, symbolic and material structure, offering a framework to the employees activity but also the activity of the employees and the system of regulations which they set up to make it effective. Taking into consideration this definition of the work organization, we define the organizational design as any collective process which makes possible to (re)conceiving, in a formal or abstract way, the components of the prescribed structure to support an acceptable and successful activity from the point of view of the whole of the actors of this process.To conceive a prescribed structure, we are convinced that an acceptable compromise by all the actors of the organization of work passes by the taking into account of the real work of the employees. This condition requires a certain structuring of the activity of the organizational design. Within the framework of the accompaniment of an industrial project of automation of production machine tools coupled to a reduction of manpower, we analyzed the dialogues of the originators duriing organizational design meetings. This analysis shows that :- the organizational simulation recently developed in ergonomics is a resource to structure a design which is based on a dialogue centered on rela work and,- the acculturation to the analysis of the activity of designers, thanks to the intervention of the ergonomist and his tools, can negotiate organizational design based on knowledge of the actual work.Furthermore, the results schow tat subjects of negotation relate more acquisition of room for maneuver.To specify the objects of negotiation and the crieria of design is to better understand the organizational design in order to equip best. Moreover, this thesis aims to appreciate the function of ther ergonomicist within the organizational design. Lastly, besides bringing methodological elements for the organizational design, this research proposes a definition of the organization of work under the angle of the negotiation."
"An unprecedented financial and economic crisis irrupted in the US in 2007, and has rapidly grown and spread to many countries around the world. The financial instrument has been widely used: in a context of financial contagion, governments have initially reacted by adopting measures to revive the economy, and then, secondly, facing mounting debt, implemented economic stabilization policies. The goal of this thesis is to highlight the importance of specific features both at regional and national level in the public decision making to stimulate economic growth. The thesis analyses the relationship between GDP and unemployment, as well as the effects of fiscal stimuli. In the first part, Okun’s law is examined at regional level in three emerging Central and Eastern European countries. In the second part, the emphasis is given to the concept of fiscal multiplier and its policy implications. In the third part, fiscal multipliers are assessed in emerging countries, particularly those of the Mediterranean and the Central and Eastern Europe regions. The thesis makes use of time series and panel econometrics methods."
"The DownSide Risk (DSR) model for portfolio optimization allows to overcome the  drawbacks of the classical Mean-Variance model concerning the asymmetry of returns and the risk perception of investors. This optimization model deals with a positive definite matrix that is endogenous with respect to the portfolio weights and hence leads to a non standard optimization problem. To bypass this hurdle, we developed a new recursive minimization procedure that ensures the convergence to the solution and gives a smooth portfolio efficient frontier. Our method consists in replacing all the returns by their nonparametric estimators counterpart using kernel mean or median regressions. This technique provides an effect similar to the case where an infinite number of observations is available. We also develop a new portfolio optimization model where the risks are measured through conditional variance or semivariance. This strategy allows us to take advantage from returns prediction which are obtained by nonparametric univariate methods. The prediction step uses kernel estimation of the conditional mean. Data from different markets are used to test and validate the proposed approaches, and results indicate better overall performance"
"This PhD thesis aims at rehabilitating the circuit analysis of economic crises. This analysiswas supplanted by the neo-liberal one at the end of the post-war boom. However, the neo-liberalmodels, and even the most recent ones, could not prevent nor solve the crisis that we are now goingthrough. We find the circuit theory, of which Marx and Keynes are distinguished representatives,much more capable of explaining the current crisis. We set up a dichotomy in economics betweenthe circuit analysis and the so-called liberal analysis, which we also call in this thesis the «marketanalysis». We show how this analysis and the hypotheses that stem from it were built. This work alsoincludes an empirical analysis. We use the circuit analysis to show the consequences of neo-liberalpolicies on economic dynamics. Thesefinancial and commercial liberalization policies should havelead us towards afull employment general equilibrium. On the contrary, they brought aunderemployment generalizeddisequilibrium.This thesis’ conclusions in terms of economic policiesare in favor of a concerted and reasoned protectionism on the international scale, as well as a controlof the financial system in order to fund non-financial corporations accumulation of capital."
"Economic growth and its driving forces have been the maintopic preoccupying economic researchers since long time in macroeconomic branch. Public investment in human capital through educational system plays an ultimate role in boosting economic growth and development, this role has taken a place since the innovative dawn of endogenous growth theory. The focus and efforts of investing in human capital could be destabilized by the global and recent return of sovereign debt crisis in several countries, which continues its rise since theearly 2007, and the after-crisis necessary adjusting policies. Getting back wise policies should be composed of mixture of growth fostering activities, including the investment in human capital, austerity and forbearance.The main purpose of this thesis is to provide new empirical inferences on debt-growth relationship and its interaction with human capital formation. Estimates are carried on a recent and complete data set that spans over 22 years and involves 76 countries worldwide. The range of invested variables encompasses many macroeconomic aggregates such as : GDP annual growthrates, public debt to GDP ratio, and public education expenditure to GDP ratio, average schooling years, inflation rate, and others. Using a superior estimation semi-parametric technic which accounts for some data issues, the empirical results suggest a heterogeneous impact of public debt and education expenditures levels on GDP growth rates. Henceforth, the use of education expenditure in the whole sample is inefficient,where policy makers should adjust and well manage the function of these expenditure in line with the public efforts to reduce debt high levels and rise economic growth. We also show that the use of textual analysis tools in economic studies, such in growth literature, offers a rapid and total lecture of the hidden research trends embodied in the huge empirical and theoretical literature of economic growth."
"Regulatory authorities of BCBS member countries decided to enforce Basel III as bankinternal risk management and market discipline have failed to avoid one of the worst crises in the historyof international finance. This Accord promotes a more resilient banking sector fostered by banks’increased ability to absorb shocks without relying on taxpayers. However, the overall effect remainsambiguous and seems to result from a bargaining between its positive and negative impacts : on theone hand, borrowers could benefit from a more stable banking system that reduces crises’ frequencyand magnitude. On the other hand, more stringent requirements could slow down banking activityand projects’ funding.We aim at evaluating Basel III effects on emerging market economies and French small and mediumsizedenterprises’ bank funding. Such bank-dependant risky borrowers are more prone to shoulder theimpact of the new regulatory requirements as they are the largest consumers of equity and liquidassets. Eventually, a more binding regulatory environment could reduce world growth. Therefore, weintroduce all the new adequacy standards and how the literature analyses them. Afterwards, we offeran empirical assessment of Basel III likely impact on emerging countries and French SMEs. We provideevidence that the new regulation could result in an overall decrease of 20% in the inflow of cross-borderbanking claims held on emerging countries. Regarding SMEs, Basel III effects could produce an Mshapedimpact pushing banks towards positions offering the best regulatory adjusted risks/returns."
"The purpose of this research is to understand how and by which mechanisms multi-generational family firms may renew and thrive across generation. The theoretical anchor just nesting in two theoretical corpus rarely involved: the family firm and strategic renewal. The work has focused especially on multi-generational family firm for what it offers as a potential study of family dimension and the importance of generational aspect in the strategic behavior. Therefore, some key concepts of strategic renewal have emerged leading to the sustainability of the family firm. By a historical and narrative approach, we analyzed the strategic renewal process in four century-old family firm. The results allowed us to understand the role of the family in the strategic renewal process and to propose an integrative model of strategic renewal of the family firm."
"In an objective to revitalize the sector, railways in Europe have gone through changes in order to introduce competitive forces in an industry previous lydominated by state monopolies. Not unlike what occurred in other network industries, the upstream management of infrastructure -considered a natural monopoly- was separated from the downstream market of train services which was deemed contestable. But the experience from previous reforms shows that the markets stemming from this new organisation are made and don’t necessarily just happen.This dissertation preys on those changing times to analyse how such transition can be achieved. More specifically, it uses the framework developed by the Theory of the Firm to investigate some of the challenges that have risen to investigate some of the challenges that have risen from this new organisation due to vertical separation and the need to develop coordination. Then using the tools developed by Agency Theory, the dissertation investigates the introduction of tendering in public procurement for rail services.Throughout the analysis, an emphasis is put on finding how regulation can provide a remedy to the identified challenges. In chapter 1, we review how the reforms were designed in Europe. It highlights that there was very various applications across countries on several dimensions such as the vertical structure, regulation or downstream competition, triggering debates on the relative merits of each option.relative merits of each option.Furthermore this plurality questions the motivations behind these choices. And although those motivationsare brought up in the literature, the previous empirical studies do nottake them into account when comparing the relative performance of one form against the other. In such a case, endogeneity might come and biased the results of econometric regressions. Having constructed a database covering four years between 2009 and 2012 in 25 European countries we use a two-stageleast-square model to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effects of the abovementioned dimensions. In conclusion, we find that endogeneity does create abias, in particular when measuring the merits of full separation. Chapter 2 builds on the French rail sector’s example to shed the light on the crucial and understudied impact of coordination costs, one of the drawbacks arising with separation in the sector. We develop a model explaining why inefficient outcomes may arise in the railway sector when vertically separated firms have to commit ex ante on quantities. Our results indicate that credible and effective price regulation can overcome the limits of separation on the infrastructure side. On the other hand, if the market is not flexible enough, it may become harder, as the downstream market is becoming more competitive, for train operators to make optimistic production forecasts."
"Relying on knowledge based view; this study tests the effects of three concepts as the prerequisites for interfirm learning: Intent to explore, Existence of novelty, and Approach of exploration. The paper defines the existence of new knowledge to be learnt by the level of partner diversity and addresses approaches of exploration by the interactive effect of the explorative intent and partner diversity. The hypotheses are tested based on a survey over a sample of 114 French companies.   Determinants of knowledge transfer between partners such as ambiguity of partner's knowledge, knowledge protection and trust are controlled.  Using Tobit regression models, the findings show that the intent to explore is positively related with interfirm knowledge transfer. Moreover, an inverted U-shape relationship is observed between partner diversity and the effectiveness of interfirm knowledge transfer. Finally, the negative moderating effect of partner diversity on the relation of exploration and knowledge transfer highlights the effect of two approaches of exploration: depth and scope of exploration. In the accordance with the concept of depth of search we find that the interactive effect of similarity of partners with explorative intent is positive on interfirm learning. We also find that a broad search scope represented by the interactive effect of partner diversity and intent to explore has negative impact on interfirm learning"
"This thesis aims to understand the mechanisms through which Payments for Environmental Services (PES) emerge and influence the effective conservation of natural ecosystems in Cambodia. It also contributes to the operationalization of institutional conceptual frameworks for the analysis of PES, as it takes to the case of one of the world’s least developed countries. In Cambodia, PES appear to be the result of political processes (negotiations) influenced by pre-existing institutions and in which some stakeholders, such as the Government and NGOs,seek to influence decisions related to the definition of new rules for the use of natural resources so that they align with their interests. This explains why some types of PES schemes face political blockages at the national level. The thesis also seeks to measure and explain the environmental effectiveness of one community-PES. The case study leads to the effective conservation of forests even when the external pressure increases. However, this effect depends on some characteristics of the local socio-economic context, probably because they influence the likelihood of local collective management of forests, which the scheme aims to strengthen. In addition, the permanence of these effects is not guaranteed in the long run. The program has indeed eroded some perceptions of use values of forest conservation, which are, in a context of poverty and strong dependence of local communities on natural resources, the foundation for partially intrinsic motivation to conserve."
"National power generation mix composition is based on the ranking (merit-order) of the various means of production from their marginal cost of electricity generation. Thus, significant reserves of hydrocarbons in oil-producing countries favoured the abusive use of oil or natural gas in the electricity mix. The purpose of this research is to analyze the power generation mix of these countries by constructing an optimal electricity mix based on the rational use (from an economic point of view) of various electricity production means. In this work, we assess the current and future situation of electricity production in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Iran, thanks to linear, dynamic and statistical modeling efforts. Thereafter, we will conduct sensitivity analysis to measure the optimality and efficiency of electricity generation by taking into account the integration of alternative non-fossil-fuel based resources."
"Media relate instances where MMORPG players are being recruited to responsibility positions, thanks to their managerial skills, acquired through playing. Do MMORPG players really develop such skills though playing, and if so, under what conditions? To explore these research questions, we're basing our works on the Social Learning Theory as well as the Social Cognitive Theory, both resulting from of Albert Bandura's researches. Literature reviewing as well as an exploratory qualitative study (13 players and older MMORPG players) led us to propose a managerial skill learning structural model of the MMORPG player. Two analyses were realized.The first one, in an exploratory aim, allowing to refine measuring tools, saw 414 questionnaires being validated (on 707 collected). The second one, with a confirmatory aim, allowing to verify hypothesis, saw 2 628 questionnaires being validated (on 3 690 collected). Once we've drawn the MMORPG player's profile, we're showing that there are managerial skill learning phenomena perceived by the players that are developed then mastered in MMORPG, under specific conditions linked to the game's environment, as well as the internal state of the player. The proposed model is thus validated.Conclusions of this research offer possibilities for players as well as organizations in various domains, such as recruitment or training, by benefiting MMORPG's potential. Longitudinal studies would deserve to be done in order to explore the MMORPG's player learning evolution, and confirm our results."
"The complexity of financial markets and the resurgence of severe crises contribute to the skepticism and evolution of standard econometric models in the explanation and prediction of financial time series. The warning given jointly by  prudential authorities and researchers aims to encourage the development of nonlinear and more complex models inspired by other disciplines. I argue in this thesis that a chaos-stochastic approach of financial dynamics is likely to lead to better results. The relevance of this association is evaluated for market risk in two distinct analytical frameworks. I show the improvements given by a synthesis of chaotic models and GARCH specifications with or without Markov Regime Switching (MRS) for modelling and predicting the Value-at-Risk of 7 mains index of Monetary and Economic Union. It appears, from this study, better results from chaos-stochastic models.  In the case of the MRS-GARCH specifications, I find more adequacy of the chaotic model of Lasota (1977) for the indices of Southern Europe, which are especially more volatile than those of Northern Europe for which I recommend the model of Mackey-Glass (1977). This combination allows, in a bivariate framework, to provide information on the relationship between these different indices. I introduce two new specifications that integrate issues related to correlation breakdowns. The first distinguishes, by a sub-periods analysis, the relations of interdependence of contagious relationships. Meanwhile, the second provides, in a unified framework, an integration of correlations breakdowns. These two analyses imply It appears from this double analysis the leading role of the Franco-German duo, the existence of two distinct spheres formed in a part by the Northern European indices and in another part by countries of the Southern Europe, and the intensification of relations between some indices following the sovereign debt crisis. Finally, these results support the relevance of a chaotic model which may account for some volatilities that are, wrongly, attributed to GARCH effects."
"This PhD studies the process of becoming a partner in professional services firms, envisaged through the lens of the building of the partner identity. To this end, it implements the concept of « career » developed by interactionist sociology to analyse the making of a partner in the context of the Big 4 international audit firms. Becoming a partner is a process that starts right after recruitment and which is governed by complex and largely informal mechanisms and political manoeuvring. We characterize these mechanisms with the help of the notion of “stable”, whose purpose is to understand procedures of co-option in their unofficial dimension but also to account for the structuration of the partner level in firms and the role played by hierarchies within this level in post-partner career progression. We come to the conclusion that auditors actually become partners much earlier than their official promotion to the rank, from the moment they consider themselves as such. This awakening is yet only the first turning point on the road to partnership. It is only when they are officially co-opted that auditors become the partners they were, by being recognised as such by their peers, completing therefore their identity conversion.This work contributes to the literature in the sociology of professions and organizational theory fields by investigating how professionals are socialized and how their identity is constructed and by grasping more accurately the organization of professional services firms"
"This dissertation introduces mechanisms that explain the international expansion of emerging-market multinational enterprises (EM MNEs) into advanced economies. It aims to provide a theoretical explanation of global champions from emerging economies. We propose path-breaking change as a complementary view that is the driver of emerging-economy firms’ international expansion into advanced economies. We argue that path-breaking change is a prerequisite before emerging-economy firms build and, in turn, leverage their ownership advantages in advanced economies. In addition, we further investigate the antecedents of path-breaking change. Building upon the upper-echelon theory, we assert that the composition of a top management team (TMT) and a board of directors (BOD) have an impact on the extent of a firm's path-breaking change. We argue that foreigners and executives with international exposure may bring new knowledge and introduce new management practices to their organizations. They may usesuch knowledge and skills to transform firms into more market-oriented entities. However, success in the domestic market may prevent a firm from changing. Firms tend to build their capabilities upon their historical path trajectory. Hence, market leadership position, conglomerate diversification, and government ties deter firms from venturing into advanced economies"
"The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the social security reform debate which is becoming an up-to-date concern with an aging population context. In this research, we analyze the impact of the macroeconomic and welfare effects of the pay-as-you-go system and of its reform especially during the transition. In this perspective we developed an overlapping generation model based on a general equilibrium framework. Our model takes into account the evolution of the Tunisian demographic structure. Results from simulations suggest that a social security reform combining a decrease in the replacement rate, an increase in the contribution rate and a five year increase in the retirement age have positive financial effects. However, it has negative effects on savings and on capital stock in the economy. According to our model, a fully funded pillar introduction, keeping total contribution rate constant, has a positive impact on macroeconomic variables. Nevertheless, this reform hurts the transitional generations welfare. Using these results, we propose a two-step reform of the Tunisian retirement system which introduces a fully funded pillar. This reform proposal can insure financial equilibrium of the retirement system until 2040."
"The rise of “Web 2.0”, commonly referred to as social or participatory Web, has reactivated the terminology of “community” to characterize the spontaneous gathering of individuals around joint discussion topics or projects. As the computerized information and content sharing platforms – such as Facebook and Twitter – develop, companies are heavily investing them by creating brand pages and accounts permitting them to take advantage of the expressivity of Internet users through the prism of the “brand community”. The animation of these innovative promotional spaces is entrusted to a new category of service providers – the community managers – responsible for promoting organizations and responding to the consumers’ ongoing demands for information. This thesis questions the dual mechanism of online collectives’ commercial reinterpretation and of the strategic aim of their management.Considering community management as a practical achievement, the analysis describes how a marketing doctrine is being unfolded in a professional activity that is successively reconfigured through the rationalization of digital brand communication. By doing so, this research wishes to contribute to a pragmatic sociology that refuses to reify the process of “digital transformation” of our societies by describing how the latter is performed by a plurality of actors working to adjust the expressiveness of connected consumers to the companies’ needs."
"In the context of a rapidly aging population, this doctoral dissertation explores the relationship between health and long-term care arrangements and addresses the issue of the financing of long-term care.Meeting the needs of dependent elderly is an important objective of public policy. Chapter 1 estimates the effects of both informal (i.e. family) care and formal (i.e. professional) home care on the mental health of French dependent elderly. The results highlight that informal care decreases the risk of depression and that formal care can improve general mental health.Recent studies acknowledge that providing informal care has adverse health effects and emphasize the importance of supporting caregivers. Chapter 2 examines the effect of social support on caregivers' health. It shows that formal care and informal support limit the negative consequences of caregiving on mental health.Finally, given the increasing financial and fiscal pressure on public systems, Chapter 3 investigates to what extent Europeans elderly are able to pay for their periods of long-term care needs on the basis of their income, financial assets and home equity. It also studies the role of reverse mortgages. The simulations stress that only a small proportion of individuals would be able to finance totally their long-term care expenses and that housing assets may play an important role in long-term care financing."
"Since the Brundtland report (1987) the number of labels and standards related to CSR have multiplied. Although historically the first works and tools related to CSR were mainly targeting large enterprises, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are increasingly concerned by this topic. This thesis aims at exploring how organizations assimilate a management tool, which, in turns, contributes to CSR institutionalization.In order to do this, we develop a particular case study in a context of SME digital inter-clusters with a sectorial CSR label. This study includes 44 interviews and observation phases within 28 businesses embedded in clusters, cluster governance authorities and system holders/creators.The contributions of this thesis project are at a managerial level to provide elements that facilitate the appreciation/valorization of this type of device by both the relevant undertakings and the device holders. At an academic level, the originality of our research field lies in its potential to open up theoretical contributions on the integration of CSR in SMEs, inter-cluster relations and management of a tool to achieve institutionalization."
"Taking the Natura 2000 sites on the French coastal area as a case study, this work aims at strengthening the understanding of the practices in terms of local biodiversity conservation measures, analysed through the concept of public policy instruments : what are the instruments that are chosen, during both the planning and implementation phases? What are the factors influencing these choices? Our work combines two approaches. First, a quantitative analysis allows us to describe the measures that are provided in 113 management documents (Docobs) of coastal Natura 2000 sites. Through a method to select and average binomial logistic models, we identify contextual factors that influence the choice of instruments of action. Second, a qualitative analysis focuses on the coastal Natura 2000 sites in Brittany and paves the way to a better understanding of the implementation of the different instruments available for the management of the sites. Our results tend to show that the choices of instruments of action on each site are parts of the adjustments allowing the integration of the policy into a formal and informal institutional local context. In particular, the regulatory instrument seems to play a significant role in the implementation of this policy, but this role is sensitive to the local context of the site, especially the political context. We emphasize the association of some instruments to different types of ecosystems. Our results lead to question the autonomous nature of the Natura 2000 policy for the marine area. Our results also highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the different instruments of action in the implementation phase, especially with regards to the associated transaction costs. In the face of the constraints that we identify, we stress the importance of the operational complementarity of voluntary and regulatory instruments, of the commitment of local authorities and of the leading role of the Natura 2000 site managers."
"We study how popular investment rules in financial markets may induce endogenous movements inasset prices, leading to higher market risk.In the first chapter, we focus on portfolio diversification. We show through a theoretical model that this strategyis beneficial at the individual investor level, but also creates endogenous links between assets and investors, whichcan be dangerous from a systemic perspective. We measure both effects in order to discuss the overall desirabilityof diversification.The second chapter considers strategies based on grouping assets that share common characteristics intodifferent classes, or styles. We postulate that these strategies create excess comovement between assets of asimilar style, as they are traded together as part of the same class. Applying this reasoning to bond credit ratings,we show that bonds joining a new rating class indeed start comoving more with the bonds of this rating, evenwhen fundamental factors suggest otherwise.In the third chapter, we study three investors who operate in the foreign exchange market: carry traders,chartists and fundamentalists. We provide a theoretical model which suggests that the interaction between thesetrading rules may explain the well documented exchange rate disconnect from its fundamental value, and lead toendogenous currency crashes."
"The main objective of the thesis is to find solutions to improve the effectiveness of risk management for Vietnamese coffee stakeholders through trading on commodity exchanges. Like any agriculture products being subject to an important international exchange, coffee is known as a price significantly fluctuated product, which impacts not only the profitability and sustainability of producing entities, but also the export value of the major producing countries. The issue of management of price risk and implicitly, which relates to the appropriateness of the derivatives usage as hedging tools are central in fact.In order to understand how derivatives are applicable in the circumstances of Vietnamese coffee producers, the thesis focused primarily on studying about how to organize the coffee supply chain in Vietnam and foreseeing whether more intervention from intermediaries (traders, industrial shopkeepers) – before the product arrives the consumer – causes any effects. Each participant may face many risks, which has a direct or indirect impact on the product sale price. Producers are exposed to the risk of falling prices while intermediaries (processors or “simple” traders) are exposed to the risk of reducing their intermediation margin. In fact, they buy the product to resell but the two activities (selling and buying) are not done in a simultaneous way. From this point of view, the risk level to which they are exposed is usually significant in comparison with their commercial margin. The thesis tried to define which the most appropriate solutions should be taken by Vietnamese coffee producers in order to protect themselves against short-term unfavorable prices. This led us to consider the relevance of domestic as well as international coffee futures markets.For exporting products like coffee, there are two types of market which coexist: The Future Market (or organized market) - such as ICE Europe in London which deals Robusta coffee, ICE Futures U.S with Arabica coffee, CME and CBOT, the oldest and most active commodity exchange in the United States, and the Forward Market which is in India, China and Vietnam. There’s no better market since each type has its advantages and disadvantages. However, based on the previous research of commodity and finance exchange, we could estimate its respective interests for the Vietnamese economy leading to the possibility of optimizing only to the risk management function. Therefore, its roles in information dissemination and the implementation of storage policies may be unavoidable in some cases. According to this evaluation, the thesis also aims to propose some methods of improving the price risk management and storage policies in the Vietnamese coffee sector."
"Indonesia is a developing country that has adopted an open economy wheretrade relations with other countries is significant. Indeed, there is a high level of internationaleconomy traffic that has substantially impacted the economy and national development.Throughout the nation’s development, cooperation and involvement with other countries hasbeen widespread. This thesis investigates the economic impact of free trade agreements andthe trade liberalization attempted in Indonesia in order to: examine the effect of tradeliberalization on the volume of exports and imports; analyse state revenue regarding aspectsof international trade, such as import duty; and provide a detailed investigation of therelationship between trade liberalization, poverty and inequality in Indonesia. An empiricalanalysis is conducted by adding liberalization factors to the import and export demandfunctions to determine the impact of liberalization on export and import activities in Indonesia.The results indicate that, for this nation, trade liberalization policies measured through exporttaxes and import duties negatively impact exports and imports. To deal with fiscal issues, itcan be concluded that the policies of trade liberalization are still able to increase importvolume. Conditions of poverty and inequality in a country can also be influenced by theopenness of its economy. The results reveal that trade liberalization negatively impactspoverty and may reduce poverty levels in Indonesia."
"This thesis investigates the cognitive factors involved all along the entrepreneurial process and their impact over the different activities underlying such process. We aim at answering the research question: What is the impact of entrepreneurial cognition on the successful implementation of an innovation?To tackle this question, we depicted the subject in three axes. The first essay proposes a conceptual model of individual innovation embedded in the entrepreneurial process. We conceptualize the different stages of creative idea generation, evaluation and implementation and examine the peculiarities of each stage and the influence of cognitive factors. The second paper presents an empirical analysis that tests the hypotheses issued from the model through an economic experiment with 70 entrepreneurs. The experimental design provides an objective measure of innovation and imitates every stage of the process: from the generation of ideas all throughout the implementation and performance of innovations in the market. Our findings show that although creativity is the source of innovations, the relationship between generation of ideas and its implementation is influenced by cognitive factors: overconfidence, optimism and risk-taking. The third essay focuses on the decision by innovative individuals to start a venture. Building on a quantitative study with 124 researches, from which 76 created their venture, we contribute to the debate about the link between innovation and entrepreneurship: being innovative is not enough for becoming an entrepreneur, self-efficacy beliefs an risk-taking behavior are two drivers of individual’s decision to start a venture."
"Although information resource management and management tools are becoming more and more numerous, the management points to a lack of coherence in the organization that could lead to a decrease in performance. The search for coherence should  be reconsidered to develop management control to be capable of fulfilling its primary mission. Our research focuses on the case of a group of automotive dealerships who has the distinction of being multi-brand and in full development phase.The thesis revisits the fundamentals of management control and provides new insights by engaging the concept of boundary object, as a mediator and co-vector in the absence of consensus within the organization.The research results thus suggest that the management tools with the properties of a boundary object, are more likely to contribute to the coherence in the organization."
"From a global perspective, a low-carbon path to development driven by a growth of nuclear power production raises issues about the availability of uranium resources. Future technologies allowing nuclear reactors to overcome the need for natural uranium will take time to fully deploy. To address these issues, we analyze the conditions of availability of uranium in the 21st century.The first two conditions are technical accessibility and economic interest, both related to the cost of production. We study them using a model that estimates the ultimate uranium resources (amounts of both discovered and undiscovered resources) and their costs. This model splits the world into regions and the resource estimate for each region derives from the present knowledge of the deposits and economic filtering. The output is a long-term supply curve that illustrates the quantities of uranium that are technically accessible as a function of their cost of production. We identify the main uncertainties of these estimates and we show that with no regional breakdown, the ultimate resources are underestimated.The other conditions of availability of uranium covered in our study are related to the market dynamics, i.e. they derive from the supply and demand clearing mechanism. To assess their influence, they are introduced as dynamic constraints in a partial equilibrium model. This model of the uranium market is deterministic, and market players are represented by regions. For instance, it takes into account the short-term correlation between price and exploration expenditures, which is the subject of a dedicate econometric study. In the longer term, constraints include anticipation of demand by consumers and a gradual depletion of the cheapest ultimate resources.Through a series of prospective simulations, we demonstrate the strong influence on long term-price trends of both the growth rate of demand during the 21st century and its anticipation. Conversely, the uncertainties related to the estimation of ultimate resources have limited influence. We also underline the uneven evolution of market shares between regions. Finally, particular changes in supply (production shutdown in one of the regions, for example) or in demand (irregular growth or introduction of new technology) also have a significant influence on the evolution of the long-term price or its cyclicity."
"The theoretical literature that deals with phosphorus considers the market of the resource as being perfectly competitive, whereas the reality of this market suggests otherwise. Indeed, several interactions occur in this market. The main aim of this thesis is to rethink this market in an imperfectly framework. More specifically, we analyze the effect of recycling on the extraction of an exhaustible resource, on the dynamic of the resource price, on its date of depletion and on the reduction of water pollution. This thesis consists in a general introduction and five theoretical chapters all dealing with the economics of phosphorus or of exhaustible resources. Chapter 1 considers a two-period model where an extractor and a recycler compete with quantities. We assume that extracted and recycled phosphorus are strategic substitutes. We show that the effect of recycling on the extracted quantities strongly depends on the level of the stock of phosphorus. Chapter 2 extends the previous chapter in a continuous time framework over an infinite horizon. It investigates the effect of phosphorus recycling on the monopolist's extraction and on the dynamic of its price. We postulate an optimal control model and show that the price of the resource does not necessarily increase through time. Chapter 3 considers that extraction and recycling can be either strategic substitutes or strategic complements. In a two-period model, we show that the effect of recycling on the monopolist's second-period marginal revenue and on its extracted quantities depends on whether extracted and recycled products are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. Chapter 4 considers that the extracting sector chooses between accommodating or preventing the recycler's entry. The entry prevention can take two forms: either deterring or blockading. In a two-period model, we show that the strategy of the extractor depends on the level of the fixed costs incurred by the recycler and on whether the resource is scarce or not. Chapter 5 addresses the problems of phosphorus exhaustion and water pollution. We consider one firm that extracts and recycles phosphorus. We investigate the influence of a tax-subsidy scheme. We show that a combination of these two instruments enables to reduce water pollution and to prolong the lifetime of phosphorus."
"Governments have recently pledged to halt the loss of biodiversity. In this context, biodiversity offsetting (BO) appeared as a political response by allowing, in principle, to reconcile two often conflicting interests: economic development and biodiversity conservation. The objective of this work is to analyse whether BO can fulfil that promise. I am considering this issue from an interdisciplinary perspective by mobilizing the contributions of economy and ecology and using three complementary approaches. First, in a theoretical perspective, I ask the question of the compatibility of the offsetting principle with its biodiversity conservation goal. Second, in an empirical approach, I investigate the strengths and limits of using BO mechanisms in conservation policies, particularly two specific mechanisms analysed through two French case-studies: habitat bank and agri-environmental contracts. I mainly use the new institutional economics framework to analyse the effectiveness of these mechanisms for achieving the environmental objectives of BO. Finally, I adopt an epistemological approach to question the role of political dynamics in the diffusion and the promotion of BO in the scientific community. The results of the theoretical analysis highlights the inherent limits to the BO principle to achieve its conservation goals, especially with regard to the impossibility to adopt a complex ecological approach to biodiversity in the process of BO. My empirical study shows that the mechanisms of BO also have limitations that force compromises likely to jeopardize the achievement of environmental objectives of BO. These outcomes highlight the role and the importance of institutions in the implementation of BO, especially to provide clear and precise rules in order to limit the emergence of opportunistic behaviours, responsible for the major problems identified. Finally, my epistemological analysis shows that the development and the promotion of BO actually respond to a political agenda driven by the Anglo-Saxon policies and some conservation stakeholders. Overall my work emphasizes that BO is not a neutral object as it serves to spread a certain ideology on the practice of biodiversity conservation through the lens of sustainable development and green economy. Finally, this work allows stressing that reconciling economic and conservation interests is a complex problem that cannot be solved by using idealized consensus. Rather, the concept of BO offers an opportunity to think about the conditions of possibilities and impossibilities of the protection of nature today."
"This thesis comprises three essays on estimation methods for the dependence between risks and its aggregation. In the first essay we propose a new method to estimate high level quantiles of sums of risks. It is based on the estimation of the ratio between the VaR (or TVaR) of the sum and the VaR (or TVaR) of the maximum of the risks. We use results on regularly varying functions. We compare the efficiency of our method with classical ones, on several models. Our method gives good results when approximating the VaR or TVaR in high levels on strongly dependent risks where at least one of the risks is heavy tailed. In the second essay we propose an estimation procedure for the distribution of an aggregated risk based on the checkerboard copula. It allows to get good estimations from a (quite) small sample of the multivariate law and a full knowledge of the marginal laws. This situation is realistic for many applications. Estimations may be improved by including in the checkerboard copula some additional information (on the law of a sub-vector or on extreme probabilities). Our approach is illustrated by numerical examples. In the third essay we propose a kernel based estimator for the spectral measure density of a bivariate distribution with regular variation. An extension of our method allows to estimate discrete spectral measures. Some convergence properties are obtained"
"This research is concerned with how « Soft » information affects small and medium-sized enterprise financing. We particularly focus on the effect of their collect and the Social interactions that allow the exchange of such information on the specific asymmetric information problems. Although banks are more and more equipped with computerized decision tools, the qualitative nature of the information collected remains decisive in filtering the records of credit to SMEs. The author of this research offers a relationship Bank-SME conceptual framework by putting in obvious place elements determining the Trust between Credit officer and borrower. This model puts in an obvious place four elements having an influence: the general context of relation and more particularly pressure of the bank and organizational structure on the Credit officer ; personal and interpersonal elements as entrepreneur’s motivation and both experiences and duration of the relationship ; Relational elements based primarily on proximity, networks and interactions as well as third party intervention and finally, the determinants of trust can encompass several elements of passion specifically banker’s intuition about the project. The author supports that the trust is built on « Soft » information which are itemized. These results were acquired from assumptions based on the literature about conventions, trust and embededness. They were supported by a double field investigation, exploratory and confirmatory conducted with Lebanese Credit officers."
"The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate that the strengthening of the environmental institutions enforces environmental responsibility. If institutional changes are setting up to promote environmental responsibility, then a co-responsibility takes form making environmental protection more efficient and more effective. Given the extent of environmental degradation and their consequences, environmental liability bccomes a panacea to the ecological crisis. The notion of sustainable development echoes to it. however anchoring in a larger dynamic. The concept ofsustainable development comes at industrial level by the corporate social responsibility. lt is clear that the answers given by the institutions and the industrial segment fall far short of responding to the environmental challenges. Historically, regulatory instruments have been mobilized to deal with irreversible damage. The recent issue of emission permits still experiences difficulties. Despite the European theoretical and empirical evidences, French ecological taxation doesn't comply with the economic recommendations. The reasons for these failures depend on the difficulties of acceptability. These considerations lead us to rethink the patterns of state intervention in environmental. The contribution of this thesis is to propose the establishment of new institutional arrangements based on the establishment of environmental institutions which have capacities of expertise, enforcement and compliance."
"Our research consists of studying the behavior of professionals, leaders, advisors, and customers, in the areas of retail banking and insurance that have implications for the risk borne by clients. Legislators and supervisors focused on regulations and standards, in particular in prudential, accounting and technical areas but underestimated the role and impact of the behavior of each actor that may be inappropriate and unfair despite the new regulatory framework. Understanding, recognition and control of the behavior of each actor are necessary for a healthy balance between efficiency of the company and respect of the interests of customers in a sustainable manner.This study was conducted in immersion during three years within the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution, allowing to see, analyze and understand in parallel the issues of supervisors and the subjects of their controls. The analysis of various national and international reports, procedures and monitoring reports, questionnaires for professionals and semi-structured interviews with all stakeholders related to our research subject, allowed to have relevant, reliable and practical elements to address our central problem.The financial activities are based on trust and in this context of continuing crisis, the need for monitoring and regulation is increasing. Banking and insurance sectors are complex, technical and hardly intelligible to the general public, the behavior of financial actors must be exemplary in their interactions with customers, especially when they present and explain financial products.Since the beginning of the crisis at the end of 2007, many international scandals have highlighted a large number of human errors related to unethical behavior in the field of consumer protection. Beyond the loopholes regarding financial or operational risks, the business practices of some financial institutions have been challenged leading to penalties by the national supervisor for certain banks and insurance companies.This raises the essential question of ethics within financial institutions and the effects of each stakeholder’s behavior in the business relationship. Ethics involves the concepts of accountability, respect and courage, it must be taken into consideration and put into practice to achieve a double objective: the human and economic performances of companies.Legislators and regulators through the directives CRD4, Solvency 2, MIF2, IMD2 PRIPs and their requirements focus mainly on accounting rules, technical and related business practices. Although many financial scandals, particularly since 2007, have shown serious behavioral excesses in finance, the measures implemented (management tools, methods or devices) to decrypt and control the behavior within financial firms are underdeveloped and underused, particularly for the risks borne by the customer.Our study describes and analyzes the behavior of professionals and clients, the role of emotions in financial decisions, the influence of standards and their controls on the behavior of professionals to understand what is contrary to a virtuous organizational functioning and responsible business practices. We question the management of risks borne by the customer within the organization and resources allocated to the protection of customers, and we propose a set of recommandations in order to reduce these risks in the future."
"Car ownership and use are a decisive part of our society, which was sometimes designed as the “civilization of the car”. Despite many critics, the car has become ever-more central in the modern way of life, with an ever-increasing number of cars per adult and proportion of trips realized by car. However, from the beginning of the millennium, there was a reversal in the trend towards ever-more car use. For the first time, the average number of daily trips realized by car has been falling down in French conurbations, and nationwide traffic by car is leveling off. This situation, nonetheless, is not specific to France but is common to many developed countries, and is often referred to as the “peak car (travel)”.  The main explanations for such a downturn include rising fuel prices from the late 1990’s, followed by the recession in 2008, but also household’s willingness to control their travel time budgets, in a context of increasing commuting distances and reduced travel speeds. Besides, the diffusion of car ownership is approaching saturation. While on the long-run, average car travel per adult is indexed on motorization, mid-term fluctuations of average car use per vehicle are related to the energetic purchasing power, and a simple model based on these two variables is suggesting that the stagnation of car use from the 2000’s could be a reaction of a usual kind to an exceptional rise in fuel prices. The growth in motorization is itself principally caused by the follow-up of ever-more motorized generations, especially among women, given their increasing access to driving license, job participation and ever-more diffuse land use patterns, which have increased the need for a second car within households.  In order to model auto-mobility, a nested, individual and longitudinal approach is implemented, segmented by gender.   Auto-mobility can indeed be seen as a follow-up of nested choices, as driving license is necessary for holding a car, while access to a personal vehicle is itself required for car use. The advantage of a longitudinal approach consists in the ability to distinguish between measures of heterogeneity and sensitivity, which can be shown not to be equivalent. For every given level of choice, the approach is based on an age-cohort-period-type analysis. Motorization rates happen to be more heterogeneous among women, a result which is likely to receive an interpretation either of a social or economic nature. According to the first interpretation, it should be regarded as the illustration of gender inequalities. However, it could also be regarded as reflecting the still-intermediary status of the second vehicle, which opportunity is assessed depending upon household’s specific needs and constraints. On the contrary, car use is at the same time higher and more heterogeneous among men, given the collective function of the first vehicle and household’s internal trade-offs in residential and job choices.  Finally, average partial effects and elasticities are estimated from panel data models, either with respect to income, fuel prices or density. Generally, results are consistent with the descriptive part, as with the literature. The model also rationally gives account of the decreasing trend for elasticities, which was often noticed in the literature and reflects the approach of saturation. As a conclusion, an a posteriori evaluation of the assumption of a sequential decision process is made, confirming that choices of motorization and car use are mutually independent."
"At the exact opposite intuitions according to which regional disparity is an unavoidable consequence of the dilemma of winners and losers, construction of inequalities in Tunisia is attributed to real forces. The first force echoes the economic development model at work since structural adjustment. Indeed, the forced march towards liberalism and globalization zeal and speed in the field has significantly contributed to the widening gap between the coastal and deep Tunisia. The polarization of economic activity which falls within the logic of productivity growth, has not exercised the desired ripple effect which helped to dig the groove separating the rest of the coastal territory. The second source of inequality raised by the thesis is the institutional environment. Indeed, the quality of regulation, political stability and the low participation of the local population in the implementation of development policies and in political life have significantly contributed in the construction of regional inequalities in Tunisia. However, economic growth is pro-poor generally. She contributed in reducing inequalities.In terms of economic policy recommendation, it seems imperative to correct if not reduce to a minimum inequality, to review the liberal flight of the Tunisian economy and its integration into the global economy pushed by a state interventionism (rethink investment incentives in the deeper regions, direct public investment in infrastructure to deeper areas ...). The second recommendation refers to the need for a shift towards a territorial development approach that gives pride of place to local stakeholders in the design and implementation of development policies. The third recommendation is the need for a revision of the horizontal and vertical modes of governance to promote the regionalization process and improve the quality of economic and political institutions"
"The objective of this research is to develop conceptual, analytical, and managerial models and insights by analyzing a portion of the supply chain made up of a retailer dealing with two suppliers in an uncertain environment. In the first part of this thesis, we consider a single high-end (or perishable) product, single period, variable unit price, variable unit production cost, variable unit shortage cost, variable unit salvagevalue, stochastic demand problem. In a second part of the thesis, we consider settings inspired by the case of large international companies sourcing some of their products from low cost countries. This structure is as follows: two products (one sourced locally and the other sourced abroad), a three-period, two-stages, two capacitated suppliers, and a single capacitated retailer. Both analytical and numerical results are provided. Important theoretical results and insights are developed for these types of settings. These models can be used as decision-making aid tools in such environments"
"This research aims at studying the impact of consumers’ tiredness on the way they perceive and process advertising information. More specifically, we try to understand how tiredness influences advertisements’ visual processing as well as consumers’ attitudes and memorization. Relying on Resource Matching theory, we hypothesize that advertising informationprocessing, and therefore advertising efficiency, is optimal when the level of available resources (consumers’ tiredness) matches the level of required resources (advertisement complexity). Results show that the impact of tiredness differs according to sample under consideration (students or staff members). Tired students adopt a “screening” visual strategyin order to compensate for tiredness effects and ease their information processing. Tired staff members adopt a “sustained attention” visual strategy consisting in mobilizing their few available resources in order to efficiently process information. In this second case, sustained visual attention leads to better advertising memorization. We show that the Resource Matching theory is not the appropriate theoretical framework to study our research object. Indeed, we find that cognitive resources are dynamic:if motivated to do so, individuals are able to adapt their resource level according to the processing task. Theoretical,  methodological and managerial implications are discussed."
"This dissertation explores how logic duality, that is the coexistence of two institutional logics in an industry, affects firm strategic behaviors, and how in return firm strategic behaviors contribute (or not) to maintain logics segregated. Theoretically, I investigate the liability firms face when entering industries governed by a different logic, the wayincumbent organizations respond to the conformity demands of logic foreigners, and the determinants of firm-level institutional capital. Empirically, I study investment funds, filmmaking organizations and production firms in the French film industry (1987-2008), and find strong support for the proposed theory. By revealing strategies available to firms in dual-logicsettings and highlighting sources of institutional capital, this study contributes to the strategic management literature. The result is also a contribution to our understanding of why industries resist the “inexorable push towards homogenization” predicted by new institutional theory. By shedding light on the positive and negative effects of logic duality for firms, this work has also implications for practice."
"Information and communication technology (ICT) radically affects the tourism industry by overturning its production and distribution vertical value chain. Direct exchange between tourist and suppliers is the beginning of a new era. ICT has also given the opportunity to many new players to introduce themselves into tourism market. From now on, travel agencies and tour operators are not the only ones able to connect supply with demand. Internet has also contributed in changing the tourist’s demands and activities. Tourism is no longer limited to a mass product. The tourism intermediaries must evolve in a less favourable environment. The question is about their place and value creation in the industry. A literature review allows us to understand that the tourism intermediary is present to overcome market’s imperfections and propose value through the following functions: informational, expertise, assurance, economic, innovation and networking. If this literature review shows that the intermediation functions are value creators, it does not necessarily claims that all functions are always carriers of value creation. Therefore, we analyse the intermediaries’ value propositions by trying to find the functions they perceive as being important to cope with tourism evolution. Consequently, we will complete our theoretical analysis with an empirical observation to identify the functions on which the intermediaries rely the most to face the evolution of the tourist market. By means of statistical analysis of our semi-structured interviews, we show in particular that: the expertise and assurance are the most important value propositions of tourism intermediaries; tour operators take less financial risks except for owning a competition-free offer. Furthermore, specialisation and destination management are revealed as strategic choices."
"In this dissertation, we propose a methodological perspective on the twofold role of language in economic rationality, economists’ uses of language to theorize it and economic agent’s uses of language to express it, can clarify three main issues (and their connections), underlying the behavioral versus standard economics debates: the issue of the theoretical unification regarding the three dimensions of economic rationality, the issue of interdisciplinarity between economics and Psychology and the positive/normative issue within models of individual behaviors. Regarding the positive/normative issue and the role of language in the behaviors of economic agents, the intention is to provide a constructive criticism of contributions from behavioral as well as standard economists. Following the entanglement thesis of philosopher Hilary Puntam and philosophers-economists Vivian Walsh and Amartya Sen, it is argued that both standard and behavioral economists propose an unsatisfying articulation between the positive and normative dimensions of models of individual behaviors; and that recognizing the entanglement of facts, values and conventions can actually be theoretically and empirically fruitful. Paying some attention to the role of language in the behaviors of economic agents may sometimes show that a seemingly irrational behavior can in fact be defended as rational; hence we argue that, and show how, the implicit axiom -- known as ‘description invariance’ -- in standard models of individual behaviors preventing the influence of language needs to be weakened (though not dropped entirely), contrary to the positions of most behavioral and standard economists."
"In business management, audit seems to be a key element of corporate governance which contributes to improve the quality of financial reporting. For this purpose, it plays an essential role in reducing the information asymmetry between stakeholders and in ensuring the credibility of accounting numbers disclosed. Firms must be audited by competent and independent auditors. In this academic area, since the seminal studies of Watts and Zimmerman (1979), and DeAngelo (1981), the operationalization of audit quality remains critical for researchers, because of its unobservable character. This thesis, hereby, proposes an analytical framework for audit and empirically examines the economic consequences of this procedure for stakeholders. On the one hand, focusing on an institutional context of implied audit (i.e. WAEMU), and based on a sample made of commercial banks over 2006-2010, we find that audit quality through mandatory joint audit is complementary to traditional corporate governance mechanisms. On the other hand, under an explicit audit context, we test an original proxy for audit quality and study its economic consequences for French listed companies over the period 2006-2013. Our results suggest that the higher single and joint auditor independence are, (1) the better earnings quality is, (2) the less implied cost of equity is, (3) the higher disclosure on goodwill impairment testing is, which leads financial analysts to greater earnings forecast revisions."
"This thesis addresses several issues: on the one hand we focus on medical practice variations; one the other hand we examine determinants of social and spatial inequalities in access to care for individuals with cancer.In recent years, high practice variations are noted by health public authorities. The first chapter wonders about the determinants of variations in the use of prostatectomy as prostate cancer management. Results indicate a strong positive influence of supply-side factors in both régions and départements.Reducing social inequalities in access to care is also achieved thanks particular scheme as the LTI system. The second chapter focuses on the determinants of health care utilization, i.e. GP and specialist physicians. For those, we differentiate between visits related (or not) to LTI conditions. Concerning GP visits, individuals with lower socio-economic status tend to have greater GP visits. Regarding specialist visits, results point out a clear influence of financial factors, especially for non LTI-related visits.Finally, since 2004 organized breast cancer screening program invites all women 50-74 to be screened. The aim of this chapter is to examine the potential influence of supplied-side factors (GP and specialist physician density) on the use of organized cancer screening in France between 2005 and 2012. Results show that a higher GP density is associated with higher screening rates. On the contrary, a higher specialist density tends to diminish the participation rate to organized screening. Results also underline the presence of a spatial effect which means that neighboring behavior in terms of cancer screening has an impact on the cancer screening rate in the observed area."
"This thesis consists of three empirical studies on the analysis of non-take-up to means-tested social assistance benefits in France. Different econometric methods were used on recent survey and experimental data. International literature on this topic is now substantial but few quantitative studies have been conducted in France. We propose, in this thesis, to provide insights on some points which have been too few studied in the French or international literature until now. The first chapter studies the non-take-up to the French basic income support program which has been hidden by the particularly high level of non-take-up to the supplemental income support. The analysis shows the presence of a substantial level of non-take-up for a poor population entitled to important level of benefits. This phenomenon appears to be explained mainly by the lack of contact of some households with the administration in charge of providing the benefits. The second chapter extends the analysis to the population of homeless as this population was not studied by former french and international works. This population has a lower non-take-up rate than the general population because homeless are generally more in need of benefits. It appears however that this population is very heterogeneous. Poorer homeless and homeless suffering worst housing conditions have a particularly high level of non-take-up. The third chapter documents the presence of spatial effects in the non-take-up of a program that provides free public transportation. The chapter shows that the farer households are from public transportation the less they claim for the program because they are less in need of such transports. The analysis shows also that the probability to know the program is affected by the propensity of households who know the program in the neighborhood. The fourth chapter tests the effect of different mailing in the propensity, for an income support beneficiary, to follow the steps required to stay in the program. The results show that the simplified mailing has no substantial effect on the attendance. However, providing information on the advantages and helps that are linked to the receipt of the income support program increases significantly the attendance of young men."
"Trademarks are the starting point of this study. The value of this intangible asset for companies and investors led me to conduct this thesis, which problematic is to question whether the financial information provided to investors in the annual reports enables them to estimate brand’s value. Our empirical observation begins with the difficulty for investors to obtain a right measure of the brand’s value. We started this study by determining the amount of information available in annual reports and whether this information is sufficient and relevant for a proper understanding of the brand’svalue. We combined, for our study, and in regards to our methodological approach based on a literature review, an exploratory case study and a confirmatory empirical research completed by a qualitative study, to draw closer to our results. Our results highlight the lack of communication related to our research and enable us to make a proposal to improve the terms of this financial information. We also brought the limits of the study out, which ones can represent areas of interest for further research."
"This thesis aims at exploring to what extent globalization, through its diversecomponents, impacts the health of European workers. In a first part, we expose the socio-economicconsequences of this multi-faceted phenomenon. In a second part, we show that internationalcompetition, one of the essential components of globalization, is a risk factor for non-skilledworkers. Nevertheless, individual and organizational factors are the most likely to explain mentaland physical disorders prevalence in the population as a whole. Globalization also implies newpractices linked to firms’ internationalization strategy, another component of globalization. Weunderline that workers must acquire the skills to stay attractive in a constantly changing worldand they do not find much support in their companies. In a third part, we show that globalizationenhances the surge of the service sector in industrialized countries. In addition, the leanmanagement is implemented in those sectors and competitive pressure increases. These changesimpact the way the work is performed. Within this context, the health of workers deterioratesbecause they are exposed to changing risk factors, among them: intense of work related tointerpersonal relationships. Finally, we find that the Corporate Social Responsibility comes as ananswer to improve workers’ health and as a consequence, firms’ social and financial performance."
"The purpose of this research is to establish factors for commercial performance in the professional training sector, the case of the N.T.C. (Neo Trainer Consultant). Empirical observation: The author has trained job seekers (more than 450) for over 10 years. Through this experience providing lessons, a suspicion arose regarding the origin of the difficulties (N.T.C.) concerning the factors for commercial performance in professional training.Research work plan: The start point is a group of five randomly selected N.T.C. to confirm the suspicion. Then the state of the art bring the definitions, the development of concepts, and the literature review, research the works that already exist in the field in France and in English-speaking countries. The concepts of expertise and confidence are highlighted.The hypotheses are defined by the Delphi group (20 experts and 4 rounds of expressed opinions) and validated by the quantitative study (301 responses). Result: This method offers 2 factors of success: demonstration of the expertise and establishment of the confidence ascribed to the 4 principal parameters influencing 2 factors of success : comprehension of the client's problem (95%), involvement (91%), realisation of similar actions (86%) and demonstration of the methods employed (77%).Managerial recommendations enlightend by the group of experts who suggest to the N.T.C to develop their charisma and authoritativeness by mastering their grasp of rhetoric. If the work creates a conflict between this notion and talent, the N.T.C. will see factors for commercial performance transform his experience into expertise and his expertise into income."
"At a time where welfare at work seems to be a priority for managers and organizations, and where mobile technologies allow permanent access to business information, increasing the porosity of borders between private and professional life; this thesis questions the impact of mobile technologies on employees’ psychological health and more specifically about their well-being (effects of nomadic technologies on the border between private and professional life, interpersonal relations, etc.). To explore this issue, we mobilized the Resources Conservation Theory (Hobfoll, 1989), a motivational theory which is based on the variety of resources available to a person in order to maintain, or reach, a situation of well-being and balance. The sales teams of a large French group, which were fitted in 2012 with Mobile Technologies (MT) constitute our field of investigation. The literature review and the results of an exploratory qualitative analysis, conducted using a semi-structured interview, with 34 commercials and managers, lead us to submit a structural model of the influence of mobile technologies on well-being at work, combining organizational, individual, and technological variables. This model was tested via a survey at a national level. From the 850 questionnaires which were sent, 400 usable responses were studied. First, our empirical results lead us to identify five categories of mobile technologies use, both depending on the nature of the technological support and on the performed task. The five obtained variables, became the input variables, through the modeling stage realized by the structural equations method. The test of research hypotheses emphasizes the role of certain resources such as autonomy, the meaning of work, the usefulness of technologies or organizational social support, especially to cope with the invasion of technology into the private sphere and the pressure related to its use. Overall, our results suggest that, despite the changes brought by the arrival of MT, there is no duality regarding the direct or indirect effect of these technologies on the stress level or on the welfare at work. Few interviewees are adamant on purely negative or purely positive impact of mobile technologies about welfare at work. However, a large majority of commercial and interviewed managers considered that the arrival of mobile technologies has ""somewhat"" favored well-being at work, despite the increased workload and technological invasion that it induced. In the end, MT seem to constitute constrained resources. To conclude this work, the theoretical and managerial contributions are presented as well as future opportunities of research."
"This thesis, focusing on the choice of residential location, is based on the theoretical framework of urban micro-economy and random utility. Though discrete choice modelling is the most appropriate in this field, the difficulty lies in choosing the appropriate model to the spatial context of residential location choice (spatial autocorrelation, large number of alternatives), on the one hand, and in the way of defining the spatial scale, on the other hand. For this purpose, we proceeded in two stages. We estimated a multinomial logit with random sampling of alternatives to understand the process of residential location choice before taking into account the spatial autocorrelation, and estimating a nested logit model. It also allowed to investigate the feasibility of applying a new method to correct biases of sampling alternatives in the case of nested logit model. In terms of results, we have shown that social environment are the most important determinants of residential location choice. Though job accessibility still weigh on household choice decision. In terms of methodology, we were able to test the feasibility of estimating a nested logit model with sampling of alternatives to analyze the choice of location of Lyon urban area. However, we could not overcome the difficulty of distinguishing spatial autocorrelation from nesting. The use of 1999 and 2007 databases to model residential location choice also helped to provide answers on the temporal transferability of location choice models and discuss in future work the predictive power of a location choice model."
"This PhD dissertation investigates the linkages between prison, reentry and recidivism. Eachof the four chapters contributes to the growing field of the economics of crime, applying a series of econometric methods on French data to answer highly policy-relevant questions.Chapter 1 explores the dynamics of the risk of recidivism after prison release. This article is the first to document the shape of the hazard of recidivism over time in France (a fastlydiminishing function) and to explore the key individual characteristics explaining the level and dynamic of this risk over time.Chapter 2 investigates the causal effect of sentence reductions on recidivism. This article is the first to explicitely account for the key mediating role of anticipations and adaptation by prisoners. By exploiting the French collective pardon of July 1996 as a natural experiment, the article finds strong evidence supporting the importance of the concrete design of sentence reductions.Chapter 3 offers the first evaluation of the causal effects of a major penal policy in France, the introduction of Electronic Monitoring (EM) as an alternative to short prison sentences. Using the staged rollout of EM across courts and over time, the paper finds evidence of significant beneficial effects of EM on recidivism, compared to incarceration.Finally, Chapter 4 measures the deterrent effect of fast versus slower incarceration on future crime. This article is the first to estimate the large beneficial impact of using fast-track procedures, instead of longer procedures, on recidivism after release."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) dominate the French business environment making a significant contribution to the national economy. Unsurprisingly, an extensive set of empirical studies explores critical issues that affect SMEs including factors that can reduce the credit risk associated with bank debt. Despite that internationalisation has a number of key characteristics that can influence credit risk, the nexus between internationalisation and credit risks remains underexplored. This thesis aims to address this knowledge gap by examining this nexus for a panel of French SMEs. To do so, the thesis estimates the effect of export intensity of French SMEs on their default probability. Key findings illustrate that internationalisation plays a critical role in decreasing the credit risk. Motivated by these results, the thesis assesses the relationship between internationalisation and modelling credit risk through evaluating the effect of several financial variables on default probability of domestic and international SMEs, separately. Interestingly, the findings reveal that modelling the credit risk of SMEs could be improved by considering domestic and international SMEs separately. According to these findings, internationalisation is one of the most important factors that should be considered in future research in relation to SMEs."
"The protection of marine natural resources is a major challenge for policy makers. The recent development of marine protected areas (MPAs) contributes to the preservation issues. MPAs are aimed to preserve the marine and coastal ecosystems while promoting human activities. The complexity of these objectives makes them difficult to reach. The purpose of this work is to conduct an ex-ante analysis of a proposed MPA to Kuriat Islands (Tunisia). This analysis is an aid to decision makers for better governance by integrating the actors involved (fisherman, visitor, boater) in the management process. To do this, we use the contingent valuation method (CVM) to samples of fishermen and visitors to the islands Kuriat. We are interested in the treatment of selection and sampling bias and uncertainty about specifying econometric models during the implementation of the CVM. We use the model HeckitBMA, which is a combination of the Heckman model (1979) and Bayesian inference, to calculate the willingness to accept of fishermen. We also use the model Zero inflated ordered probit (ZIOP), which is a combination of a binary probit with an ordered probit, to calculate the willingness to pay of visitors after correcting the sample by multiple imputation. Our results show that groups of actors are distinguished by their activity and economic conditions that cause them to have different perceptions. This allows policy makers to develop a policy of compensation to compensate the players who have been harmed."
"Agriculture and rural sector play a key role in the development process of agriculture-based countries. This function can beensured only by public policy that takes into account the diversity and complexity of rural areas. It is therefore essential todeepen the knowledge of each context and the ongoing dynamics. This study introduces an analysis of the relationshipsbetween rural social structure and structural transformation through a microeconomic perspective, with an application inMadagascar, in the Itasy region. Specifically, the Moderate Prosperty class, which is an adaptation of the middle class notionto poor rural areas, is used as an analytical framework. To this end, the first step aims to conduct a conceptual, theoretical andmethodological construction of the Moderate Prosperity notion by using the rural livelihoods framework and provides anoperational conceptual framework. Second, the conceptual framework, thus defined, is used to implement a multidimensionalstratification of the social space in Itasy by conducting a classification method on quantitative data dating from 2008. Thisstep aims to define the various Moderate Prosperity and social classes that reflect the heterogeneity of the nature andprofitability of the rural households’ livelihoods. Third, a dynamic analysis of the Moderate Prosperity groups is conductedby combining quantitative with qualitative methods based on a longer observation period. Several trajectories linked to thevarious classes can be observed. They allow us to understand the construction and transformation process of the familyproductive organizations in Itasy. The last step uses the Moderate Prosperity framework to study the specific issue of thecredit demand and the supply adequacy on the financial market in Itasy. It appears that the financing demand is highlysegmented according to the social groups and the available supply cannot meet their financing needs, despite the existence ofinnovative products. Inclusive policies that are adapted to each household profile are therefore necessary to ensure a rapidand harmonious structural transformation in Itasy."
"In the first part, the thesis discusses structural change, not only from offerconditions but also from the point of view of the demand parameters. Following theHarrod, Prebisch, Kaldor and Thirlwall analysis, we identified the existence of astructural constraint to growth, as a result of the particular foreign trade dynamic inthe less advanced economies (demand for imports vs. demand for exports). Weexamined the different theoretical models that formalize such restriction and, weelaborated a Thirlwall's Law empirical test in five emerging economies (Brazil,Colombia, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia).In the second part, the thesis examines the structural change process in South Koreaand Colombia, in order to understand how these countries, have deal with thisrestriction and how it has impacted their long-term economic growth. To accomplishthis historical analysis, the key concepts of French regulation school areincorporated."
"This thesis raises the question of the appropriate type of management accounting in local government. Thepurpose of this research is to study how local authorities have been using managerial accounting. Originally,managerial accounting was meant for companies and using it for non-profit organizations, which have differentpurposes, is problematic. Studying the literature on this topic shows that the use of this management tool bylocal authorities since the 1980s has not been smooth, as it originated from an ideal-type of managerialaccounting applying to companies. There is no recent literature reflecting the real conditions of thismanagement tool in local authorities.Our exploratory and qualitative research, built on nine case studies, reveals a wide variety of practices, whichenabled us to develop research hypotheses. These hypotheses were then tested on a large-scale, throughquantitative research. The 124 completed questionnaires we analyzed showed that managerial accounting isincreasingly used to address diversified targets and uses different approaches and methods. This in turnenabled us to build typologies. This research shows that local authorities have opted for a contingent approachto managerial accounting. Current transpositions focus more on the aims of management accounting (lookingfor legitimacy or efficiency), than on its contents (cost method)."
"This research focuses on protest movements towards market system and its devices, having for main motive the social and environmental concerns. This work aims at underlining the existence of the socially responsible resistance (SRR) and therefore its interest, considering its uniqueness and the managerial challenges that it implies. Through an observational netnography approach using an interpretativist method for data analysis, the research is based on a study of three virtual different communities’representative of the investigated phenomenon and leads to two major results. On the first hand,  the research end in an understanding conceptualization of the phenomenon, stressing its initiator factors, caracteristics, but also the SRR wide range of expression forms. On the other hand, this work emphasizes evolution and reform perspectives of marketing practices, methods and strategies."
"The objective of this thesis is to better understand the participation of internet users in creative crowdsourcing activities, which is often used in marketing to generate new innovation and/or communication ideas. After providing a definition and a conceptual delimitation of the term, we propose a literature review about the participants and their motivations to contribute. We then present the results of three exploratory studies which help us better understanding who these participants are and what influences their participation on a crowdsourcing platform. This literature review and the results of our exploratory studies then allow us to propose a theoretical model based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and to test it with a questionnaire sent to eYeka community members. The analysis of 1,261 responses as well as secondary data reveals that participation intention is predicted by the members’ attitude towards the brief (which is, in turn, best predicted by the task’s perceived autonomy) and the attitude towards the platform, but not by the attitude towards the brand which sponsors of the contest. Peer pressure is another antecedent to be positively and significantly correlated to participation intention, but the hypothesized moderating effect of cultural variables is not verified. Finally, we find that participation intention positively predicts effective participation, and that this relationship is moderated by the professional status of the individual. We end our work with a discussion of our results and by outlining future research proposals for academics to consider."
"In this thesis we are interested in the following question: does the CSR management impact significantly the instrumental and organizational characteristics of the management accountant function? Firstly, we propose a theoretical analysis of the question by using a fonctionnalist and contingency approach of the management accountant. With reference to the ""dissociated/integrated"" modalities of CSR management (Capron & Quairel 2006), we suggest that in the dissociated way, there is no significant impact of CSR management on the management accountant characteristics. In the integrated way of CSR management, we suggest that there is a significant impact. Secondly, we realize a qualitative study based on interviews and documents analysis in five organizational contexts in order to evaluate our theoretical analysis and formulate some testable hypothesis. This study shows that in these organizations, CSR management is systematically dissociated and management accountants are maintained in their traditional economic missions. Based on these results, we stated twelve hypotheses that express the significant impact of CSR management on the management accountant function characteristics. Thirdly, we collect some data with a survey (92 management accountants respondants) to test these hypotheses. Based on this data, we have rejected the twelve previously stated hypotheses. Finally, in regard of these results, we defend the thesis that: due to its dissociated nature, CSR management does not impact significantly the instrumental and organizational characteristics of the management accountant function."
"This dissertation deals with the impact of speculative behaviour on output patterns of the real economy. The impact may be twofold. Speculative behaviour occurs due to positive developments at the real economy and optimistic outlooks. Also, speculative behaviour may occur at other markets, like the stock market. We address both, a spill-over effect and the build up of speculation due to economic activity. Therefore, we implement realistic behaviour in an evolutionary framework and use emerging heterogeneity for the impact assessment. lnspired by the dotcom-bubble we focus on technological advancement as possible factor of growing optimism. ln the first part of this thesis we introduce feedback from stock prices into a model of economic growth determined by financing constraints. We focus on three known feedback channels: stock market information for the assessment of creditworthiness, stock market value as determinant in determining bankruptcy of a firm and performance based compensation of the firm management. The second part introduces financing constraints into an evolutionary framework and tackles determinants of credit supply for their impact on the occurrence of innovation. Those determinants are market based and also behavioural in nature. The third part provides a more detailed bank behaviour and two industrial sectors competing for credit. Therefore, the third part is a refinement of the second one."
"This Ph.D. Dissertation aims at providing accurate and simple tool to evaluate income inequality and mobility. Our work relies on a subgroup decomposition property recently introduced in the literature as the $``$emph{weak decomposition}$""$ to break down total disparities into within-group and between-group disparities. A particular interest is given to the context in which subgroup decomposition can be applied. We introduce within-group and between-group transfer principles that can be modulated according to a decision maker's preferences. The axiomatic basis of the subgroup decomposition property are also dealt with. Some general weighing functions are introduced to caracterize a two-parameters class of inequality measures denoted denoted (alpha,delta)-Gini. The parameters alpha and delta allow capturing the set of decision's maker point of view (from extrem leftist to extreme rightist). Furthermore, we demonstrate the the application of the weak decomposition can easily be extended to income mobility. We propose an adaptation of the subgroup decomposition property to a bimensional framework and we characterize 2 classes of  inequality adjusted growth and income movements measures consistent with such a property. Various empirical studies are also carried out to illustrate the various developed concepts."
"In this thesis we combine long memory processes and regime switching models to study the nonlinear dynamics of hedge funds returns and their exposure to market risk. The attractiveness of hedge funds lies in their ability to generate returns uncorrelated to those of traditional assets while allowing to improve returns and/or reduce the risk, regardless of market conditions. However, some specificity of returns of hedge funds as their nonlinear and asymmetric nature as well as the presence of a strong autocorrelation in related to illiquidity problems make this aspect only valid in a Gaussian framework. In this study, we adopt an econometric approach that reconciles the notion of long memory and that of pure performance persistence. In this regard, we focus on the risk of confusion between real and spurious long memory long memory since certain processes can generate similar characteristics to that of long memory processes. It appears from this study not only the inadequacy of standard models to take into account the characteristics of the series of financial returns but also the relevance of using mixed models to better understand all of these features within a unified framework. The Beta Switching ARFIMA-FIGARCH mode we suggest reveals the complexity of hedge fund return dynamics and proves the need to better understand the dynamics of returns of hedge funds in order to explain the interactions between hedge funds themselves and between hedge funds and standard markets. The long memory component is taken into account both at the conditional mean through the ARFIMA process and at the conditional variance through several specifications heteroscedatic fractional processes including FIGARCH, FIAPARCH and HYGARCH models. This model take into account several features of hedge fund returns, highlights their hidden risks and represents a new perspective to which managers could move."
"Voluntary certifications offer consumers information on the process in which products are produced. Farmers’ organizations play an important role in the management of certifications and in small-farmer access to certified markets. Costa Rican farmers’ organizations have a long history of participation in the certified value chain and in fomenting small farmers’ access to certified markets.  Farmers’ organizations also make strategic decisions related to the organization’s participation in the certified value chain and how farmers are supported and incentivized to join.For these reasons Costa Rica provides an interesting milieu to study how farmers’ organizations manage certifications. Because of their importance in the certification process in Costa Rica, this research focuses on cooperatives and consortia of cooperatives. Considering the gap in knowledge regarding the role of cooperatives and voluntary coffee certifications, this thesis presents the following questions: What is the role of cooperatives in the management of voluntary coffee certifications?, What are the advantages and disadvantages of participation in voluntary certifications for cooperatives?, What changes do certifications induce at the cooperative and farm levels?, What social aspects in Costa Rica influence the management and effectiveness of certifications? Administrators from twenty of the twenty-two coffee cooperatives in Costa Rica were interviewed to obtain basic data on harvest size, membership and management and participation in certifications. Four cooperatives were selected for in-depth case studies.Certifications are often criticized for not eliciting widespread change at the farm level due to the selection of compliant farms, but it is the structure of the certifications, including low demand, weak and variable price incentives, high costs of auditing and high requirements for management and training, which incentivize cooperatives to choose individual certifications.In Costa Rica, voluntary coffee certifications promote small but real benefits to cooperatives and their members. Cooperatives make decisions about the management of certifications based on their business strategies, the type of coffee they produce and the social capital inherent in the cooperative, which is manifested as a group solidarity approach or a commercial approach.Certifications incite a more holistic approach to coffee production by requiring training and services related to sustainable production. Certifications encourage cooperatives to collaborate with other stakeholders, increasing their connectedness and organizational social capital. This gives members access to new knowledge and services and has the potential to create a virtuous cycle of the production of social capital.Certifications, however, may induce cooperatives to offer additional services or financial incentives to some members and not to others. A high level of social capital is needed at the administrative level to ensure an equitable distribution of the benefits of certifications while still offering members incentives to pursue certifications."
"Chapters 1 and 2 revisit the Beard and Beil (1994) two-player coordination game with two Nash equilibria: one Pareto-efficient, the other is Pareto-inefficient and involves a weakly dominated strategy. Existing experiments using this game robustly show that suboptimal outcomes arise as a result of two puzzling behaviors: (i) subjects doubt that the offer players will seek to maximize their own payoff (ii) these doubts are, in some instances, justified. In Chapter l, we report on new experiments investigating whether the inequality in payoffs between players, maintained in most lab implementations 0 this game, may explain such behavior. Our data clearly show that the failure to maximize personal payoffs, as well as the fear that others might act this way, do not stem from inequality aversion. This result is robust to: varying saliency of decisions, repetition-based learning and cultural differences between France and Pol and. Then, we assess whether information about the interaction partner helps eliminate inefficiency in this game. Our treatments involve three information ¬enhancing mechanisms: repetition and two kinds of individual signals, messages from partner or observation of his past choices. Repetition-based learning increases the frequencies of the most efficient outcome and the most costly strategic mismatch. Moreover, it is superseded b, individual signals. Like previous empirical studies, we report that signals provide a screening of partners' intentions that reduces the frequency of strategic mismatches. Unlike these studies, we find that the transmission of information between partners, either via messages or observation, does not suffice to significantly increase the overall efficiency of outcomes. This happens mostly because additional information does not restrain the use of the dominated action. Therefore, this chapter identifies important limitations of cheap-talk communication -- a mechanism generally considered by economists as a useful means to improve the efficiency of economic interactions. It suggests that in the absence of a pronounced link between one's words and actions, institutions involving communication may well happen to be insufficient for this purpose. This issue is addressed in Chapter 2 where we explore whether the social psychology theory of commitment via a truth-telling oath can improve the performance of pre-play communication regarding the coordination of strategies and the efficiency of outcomes. As an addition to the classical cheap-¬talk communication protocol utilized in Chapter l, we ask ail players to sign voluntarily a truth-telling oath before entering the lab. Three principle results emerge with commitment-via-the-oath: (1) efficient coordination increases by nearly 50 percent; (2) senders' messages are significantly more truthful and actions more efficient, and (3) receivers' trust of messages increases."
"From the linkage between interpersonally comparable well-being and equity based on the separateness of persons, the Ph. D. dissertation introduces a theoretical framework in which ethical preferences are represented by additively separable social welfare functions. The thesis has two goals ; by exhibiting distributive judgments necessarily embodied by the functions that fulfil income transfer principles, the first aim is to provide comparison cirteria between these functions and those that fulfill utility transfer principles (prioritarian functions). The  second aim is to expose a plurality of distributive judgments and of degrees of adhesion they can rise. For such purposes, interpersonal comparability of utility as well as that of ethical values (transformed utilities) are needed. This two-level comparability is granted when inter-household utility ratios are supposed to be comparable. In this framework, the social welfare functions satisfying the Pigou-Dalton principle of income transfer are not necessarily prioritarian. Moreover, the functions potentially support two meanings of adhesion for inequality aversion. First, if a function is willing to endorse a inequality-reducing transfer entailing a greater loss in the transferred benefit to be socially desirable, then it is more inequality averse. This definition is characterized by proportional transfer principles well-adapted to ratio-scale comparability of utility. Second, the degree of adhesion for inequality aversion is presented as a downside inequality aversion. Informational hypothesis rule out parts of the exposition of the plurality of degrees, they put limits to distributive judgments too. By going beyond that, the Ph. D. dissertation studies the interplay between any number of income and utility transfer principles all defined recursively. Finally, four distributive judgments are characterized by the fulfilment and/or non-fulfilment of a set of transfer principles. The willingness to neglect the welfare evolution of a given proportion of population to take into account that of a minority represents the degree of adhesion for one of those judgments."

"In agricultural markets, producers incur price and production risks as well as other risks related to production contingencies. These risks impact the producer activity and could decrease his income. The globalization of markets, particularly those of agricultural commodities, provides hedging instruments including futures contracts which will serve to develop a hedging strategy. However, the situation whereby a single futures contract-based positions could offset many risks leads to incomplete market. Especially, an producer looking for better hedging strategy could also include insurance, option contract or mutual funds  to further guarantee his income, specially when crop yields are lower than expected.vspace{0.25cm}We investigate the hedging strategies in static framework as well as in continuous time framework. Prior, we analyze the behavior of agricultural prices using various statistical approaches and suggest appropriate price modeling for data at hands. The static hedging strategy also accounts for rollover process which gives raise to additional risks due to spread between new futures and nearby futures and inter-crop hedging. We particularly address hedging strategy that combines futures and insurance contracts. Since decisions making in static framework does not include price changes along the hedging horizon, optimal hedging strategy in continuous time framework will take into account jumps and seasonality by combining futures and option contracts."
"Innovation and management control are both considered as determinants of business performance. Yet, these two concepts appear at first sight contradictory, and some researchers have presented them as difficult to reconcile, advocating innovative organizations to have recourse to other modes of control. The issue of the role and influence of management control in innovative context arises and motivates this doctoral work.Beyond the literature concerned with the influence of management control on innovation, we use the theoretical and conceptual frameworks bearing on managerial innovation and organizational ambidexterity in order to deal with this issue of the link between management control and product innovation. The methodology is exploratory, qualitative and adductive corresponding thus to an interpretativist epistemological positioning. It consists of a two-stage approach : an exploratory study with nineteen start-ups and SMEs innovative and two case studies of SME which are both recently entered into an innovation strategy.The results of this research show that innovation and management control are far from being antagonistic. First, management control whether interactive or cybernetic type appears as favorable to innovation, but innovation also appears to impact the management control systems, pushing companies to develop tools of control on the one hand, tools which are reshaped and adapted on the other hand. Finally, we observe that product innovation and managerial innovation support each other, but also that management control appears as contextual ambidexterity support. Moreover, this study highlights the key role of the leader as hybrid or ambidextrous actor."
"This thesis explores the relationship between ownership structure (cooperative versus investorowned), market strategies as well as financial performance and risk. It tackles three databases in three different sectors: (1) French SMEs, (2) French wine sector (3) and financial institutions in the USA, along with a comparative methodology using empirical data. It contributes to the existing literature through a transversal approach between marketing and finance, in the framework of cooperatives with significant samples of data.Results show that cooperatives have lower levels of financial performance (except thrifts) with lower financial risk (except credit unions) compared to investor-owned firms; cooperatives have higher level of capitalization allowing them to face economic crises. Moreover, cooperatives adopt different market strategies. Research in the wine sector show that cooperatives tend to choose collective branding whereas investor-owned firms prefer private brands. As for financial institutions, business lines and relationship lending approaches vary according to ownership structures. In terms of the relationship between ownership structure and market strategies on one hand, and financial performance and risk on the other, results show that market strategies can affect financial performance while the main factor reducing the risk is cooperative structure."
"The purpose of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the carbon price quota structure, the analysis of its fluctuation, and the interactions that may exist between on the one hand the EU system of emission quota exchange (ETS) and the mechanism for clean development (CDM) and on the other hand between carbon quota market and the quota in the energy sector. For this study, we introduced the hypothesis of heterogeneity of agents' behavior on the carbon market where coexist multiple scales of investments.To achieve this, we used a time-frequency approach (wavelets) that can analyze the local behavior of a signal by isolating the components related to the agents’ trading frequency. This method allows variance decomposition of a time series into different frequency components. The time investment horizons are assigned to each frequency band associated with a degree of market risk. High frequency bands obtained by wavelet decomposition contain information pertaining to the short-term time series structure; the medium and the low frequencies respectively capture the structures of the time series in the medium and long term.To complete this project we proposed developing of our research in 3 chapters:The first chapter presents the carbon market, its creation, its operation, and the various actors who animate it. The formation of the CO2 price, its evolution and its determinants were also analyzed during this chapter.The second chapter develops a multi-scale analysis of the co-movement between price of quota (ETS) and carbon credit (CDM). This particular study was based on two assumptions:- The first assumption was the homogeneity of the various agents’ behaviors. The co-movement relationship between the price of quota (ETS) and carbon credit (CDM) assumes that market participants have the same investment strategy especially since all stakeholders agents invest in these markets on the same horizons. This relationship is studied using standard econometric tools such as Analysis of Co-integration of causality and Vector Autoregressive modeling.The main result of this specific part highlights the existence of a unidirectional causality from the ERC to the EUA with an observed acceleration of the mechanism for clean development (CDM). Manufacturers have a strong interest in the CDM which has had a direct impact on the price of EUAs on the European carbon market. We also observed a dynamic interconnection through the VAR (1) between EUA and CER.- The second assumption is the heterogeneity of agents' behavior. We highlighted  the relationship of co-movement between price of quota (ETS) and carbon credit (CDM) to a multi-scale analysis derived from wavelet theory. We show that whatever the different investment horizons retained (short, medium and long term), there is a significant positive relationship between the two sets of prices. The more dynamic causal wavelet on each pair of frequency bands detects an unstable relationship between EUA and CER which confirms our working hypothesis.And finally, a third chapter that complements the previous analysis by the co-movement between multi-scale carbon allowance prices resulting from the ETS to those energy markets (oil, coal and gas). Using coherence wavelet, it examined the simultaneous dependence (co-movement) between two price series in time and frequency. It can be interpreted as a local measurement of correlation calculated non-parametrically. Overall, this study is the first attempt at a multi-scale analysis of the co-movement relationship between the CO2 market, Oil, Gas and Coal which is based on the hypothesis of heterogeneity of agents using a template from wavelet algorithm. The model used in this study will allow stakeholders agents on the carbon market to have a great range of choices for their strategies to be able to anticipate wisely because of the high volatility of carbon prices on their different investment horizons."
"The CAC 40 index is the first thing that comes to mind when talking about financial markets. However it is not negotiable. Therefore appeared derivative contracts such as futures contract FCE whose underlying is the CAC40 index which can be bought and sold. Their values are very close but not equal. So what is the relationship between the FCE contract and the CAC40? Using daily downloadable data on the Internet and accessible to everyone, answers will be given. In the first part we present the future contracts derived from the CAC40, the reasons to trade it, and we compare it to other stock index futures in the world. We then study the relationship FCE / CAC40 in terms of informational efficiency. For that we will study different notions of basis and try to model them. Finally in the last part we are interested in the same relationship but with a microstructure point of view, studying in particular non-price variables: volume and open interest, and volatility. Finally, we will try to modelise volatility with these variables."
"As a large agricultural country, it is of great importance to study on household consumption in rural China. Many factors may affect consumption, such factors including not only those related to the tremendous changes in the labor market, i.e., the increasing number of rural to urban migration, but also unprecedented changes in the accumulation of household wealth. Until now, systematic evidence is missing on how consumption is affected by migration and household wealth. Moreover, regarding rural household consumption, another related issue, consumption poverty, should also be studied, but so far less has been said on the targeting performance of the poverty alleviation policy, the rural Dibao Program.The first chapter concentrates on the impact of migration and remittances on educational investment in rural China. Using household data from the China Household Income Project 2013, we find that they both play a negative role, but the amount of remittances can act as an insurance mechanism. The second chapter focuses on the wealth effect on consumption and its changes between 2002 and 2013. It shows that the marginal propensity to consume out of net wealth is highly significant and it increases over time for both urban and rural households. Moreover, housing wealth effects are strong, especially for the rural households, while the estimated elasticity of consumption with respect to financial assets is much smaller and elusive over the two years. The third chapter evaluates the targeting performance of the rural Dibao program. The result reveals quite large targeting errors using traditional income identification criteria. However, after taken the multi-dimensional identification criterion the targeting effectiveness increases, but the coverage rate remains low."
"In a managerial literature balancing between criticism and defendants, the budget, object of the present research is omnipresent in the managerial practices of enterprises. In this study, the approach of this management control tool is particular: we access the budgetary system according to its degree of complexity.The  first objective of this research is to conceive a taxonomy  of budgetary systems within a specific context: the SME in Tunisia.The main questioning is to identify the structural (SME) and behavioral (the manager) contingencies that influence the complexity  of the budgetary system.Being the  principal actor  in the SME, the manager is subject to  a particular attention; that justifies  the second objective of this research: conceiving a typology of Tunisian managers.Data analysis has been collected through questionnaires administrated by direct interviews  within 116 industrial Tunisian  SME's. It has  shown that there are no structural or behavioral determinism that explain the variability of observed budgetary systems within Tunisian SME's.The  profiles of managers that appeared through the typological analysis regroup social, professional   ( experience, education) and cultural ( Hofstede) dimensions: Two main results show from this analysis: First, considering an Arab culture is a reducing vision of the richness of these nations. Second, the profiles of Tunisian managers are culturally different."
"This PhD dissertation is made of four papers on central banking in inflation-targeting emerging economies. The first part of the dissertation is dedicated to two empirical works, based on the experiences of the 19 emerging economies that have adopted an inflation-targeting framework. I examine what exchange rate arrangement these economies are implementing together with the inflation targeting strategy, and what can explain their choice. ln the first chapter, I propose a new method to build up taxonomies of exchange-rate regimes. My approach is based on Gaussian mixture estimates. ln the second chapter, the choices for exchange-rate arrangements are explained though panel econometrics analysis. The second part of the dissertation is about the theory of optimal monetary policy. ln the first chapter, I propose an original dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to study what should monetary policy do when food price hikes, in a small open emerging economy. ln the last chapter, a similar modeling approach is used to analysis how credit constraints impact monetary policy in financially venerable emerging economies."
"The place of scientific research activities in the economic dynamics, especially their links with enterprises and territories have been studied largely since the 1990s, and have produced extensive literature. After first synthesizing and putting those studies into perspective, this thesis intends to contribute to the analysis of the role of this research in the economic development of territories, focusing on the local territory. Our reflexion is based on a double case study, both thematic and geographical: the field of marine sciences, with the territories of Brest and Western Brittany (France) as a baseline case. Three types of methods are implemented. First, to characterize the field of marine research, scientific production in that field is analyzed on a global scale. This step highlights the inclusion of this field in the institutional and territorial realities: locally based scientific entities, and even in some cases whole local research systems. Then, the economic benefits related to the localized spending of the research activity are estimated, mainly using an input-output modeling adapted to the regional and local scales. If the results do reveal the relatively limited nature of these benefits in our case study, they also reveal the good potential of the research activity in terms of outputs multipliers, added value and employment. Finally, the impacts of research on supply actors are grasped, namely ""knowledge transfer"" types of effects. A comparative survey is conducted on two territories: Brest and Bergen (Norway). Several factors, both internal and external to scientific institutions, appear to be decisive in the level and quality of such transfers at large: more specifically, the extent to which the research conducted locally and the locally existing economic activities match. A strong heterogeneity in the distribution of those effects – disciplinary, sectorial and spatial – can also be observed. Overall, the results shed singular and innovative light on the potential integration of the research activity in a territorial development strategy."
"The main objective of this thesis is the study of the model risk and its quantification through monetary measures. On the other hand we expect it to fit a large set of complex (exotic) financial products. The first two chapters treat the model risk problem both from the empirical and the theoretical point of view, while the third chapter concentrates on a theoretical study of another financial risk called basis risk. In the first chapter of this thesis, we are interested in the model-independent pricing and hedging of complex financial products, when a set of standard (vanilla) products are available in the market. We follow the optimal transport approach for the computation of the option bounds and the super (sub)-hedging strategies. We characterize the optimal martingale probability measures, under which the exotic option price attains the model-free bounds; we devote special interest to the case when the martingales are positive. We stress in particular on the symmetry relations that arise when studying the option bounds. In the second chapter, we approach the model risk problem from an empirical point of view. We study the optimal management of a natural gas storage and we quantify the impact of that risk on the gas storage value. As already mentioned, the last chapter concentrates on the basis risk, which is the risk that arises when one hedges a contingent claim written on a non-tradable but observable asset (e.g. the temperature) using a portfolio of correlated tradable assets. One hedging criterion is the mean-variance minimization, which is closely related to the celebrated Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition. That decomposition can be deduced from the resolution of a special Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) driven by a càdlàg martingale. When this martingale is a standard Brownian motion, the related BSDEs are strongly related to semi-linear parabolic PDEs. In that chapter, we formulate a deterministic problem generalizing those PDEs to the general context of martingales and we apply this methodology to discuss some properties of the Föllmer-Schweizer decomposition. We also give an explicit expression of such decomposition of the option payoff when the underlying prices are exponential of additives processes."
"Today working life is characterized by highly complex, unpredictability and insecurity. The interest for employability was motivated by the economic impact of skills shortages and labor force; the changing nature of careers, and the erosion of job security.To ensure the job security of its employees who are guarantors of its adaptation and its performance, the organization must take action to maintain and to develop their employability.The purpose of our study is to understand how HR practices influence employability and organizational commitment. The answer to this issue helps organizations provide a suitable method in terms how to use HR practices which they have at their disposal approach.Two types of methodology were crossed. First, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted with a multi-actor sample, 21 persons (executives, DHR and employees) were interviewed. It aimed to enrich and to verify the relevance of the research model proposed after the literature review; to identify HR practices in favor to employability; and to explore the concept of employability through an explanation of its dimensions. Then a quantitative study among 266 employees helps us to confirm the type of relationship that may exist between HR practices, employability and organizational commitment.Our research shows that in a general way, HR practices positively influence the employability and organizational commitment particularly affective dimension. This study suggests five families of HR practices (the learning organization and mobility, training and evaluation, communication, compensation and management planning of employment and skills) acting on employability (individual approach, skills approach, and internal / external approachs) and organizational commitment (affective dimension and continuance dimension)."
"In France, one in four inhabitants is exposed to floods. In this thesis, we studied the mechanisms that lead individuals to adapt to these natural risks. More specifically, we examined the influence of the characteristics of individuals and their situations relating to risks on their adaptation decisions. To do so, we conducted a quantitative survey of 331 inhabitants of flood-prone areas in the South of France. To design the questionnaire used in the quantitative survey, we relied on the literature and on the analysis of an exploratory qualitative survey. According to our results, the appraisal of the threat posed by floods and the perception of the severity of past experiences of such disasters have a positive effect on adaptation intentions, as described in the Protection Motivation Theory (Grothmann and Reusswig, 2006). Our results also suggest the existence of a negative feedback effect of past adaptation decisions on the appraisal of the threat posed by floods. Consequently, caution should be taken when interpreting the observed relations between perceptions and past adaptation decisions. Moreover, our results show a positive relation between indicators of the frequency and severity of floods and the respondents' perceptions of these features. Since these perceptions have a positive effect on the intention to adapt, it implies that the individuals who face the most frequent and severe floods are the most likely to adapt to these risks in our sample. We also examined the relations between perceptions and attitudes in the domains of financial and flood risks and studied the influence of these variables on individual adaptation to floods. To do so, we used the financial subscale of the DOSPERT psychometric scale (Weber et al., 2002; Blais and Weber, 2006) and developed a new subscale following this model, but relating to flood risks. The new subscale has acceptable internal and external consistencies. The analysis of the data collected using the flood and financial risks subscales suggests that these two types of risks tend to compete with each other. Hence, the importance granted by the respondents to financial risks compared to flood risks seems to have a negative effect on their adaptation intentions. Consequently, precautionary measures cannot be treated as types of self-insurance, which reduce only the risk of financial loss. Thus, our results suggest that individual adaptation to floods depends in particular on people's perceptions and attitudes regarding financial and flood risks, but also on their perceptions regarding the measures that can be taken to adapt to floods. According to the social amplification of risk framework (Kasperson et al., 1988), perceptions and attitudes can be modified by the first-hand or indirect experience of a risk. Our results support the hypothesis that first-hand flood experience changes attitudes and perceptions, not only in the flood domain, but also in the financial domain. To examine the role of indirect experience of floods on individual adaptation, we designed a theoretical model. It describes the relations between the components which can be taken into account to study the diffusion of an adaptation measure within a social network. In particular, social interactions are represented in this model."

"The place assigned to Gabriel Bonnot de Mably (1709-1785) in contemporary historiography is ambiguous. He is portrayed as a main influence of the French Revolution then as a precursor to the communist doctrine. Recently, the Cambridge School works' and in particular Pocock's works led to a consensus: Mably was the archetype of classical republicanism in France in 18th century. The aim of this thesis is to examine the membership of Mably in this republican tradition taking into account two fundamental elements of his thought: i) his connection with Vincent de Gournay and the ""science of commerce""; ii) the influences of modern natural law and in particular that of John Locke. This leads to reassess the controversy between Mably and Physiocrats. He seems close to accepting the Physiocratie argument for a society based on self-interest and individual calculation. But only a republican solution, the participation in the collective life of every citizen, is able to secure the theory, called liberal, of natural law. His opposition to the liberalization of grain tracte results from a defense of the ""science of commerce"" i.e. a framed free trade. Thus, paying particular attention to Mably's intellectual influences particularly those of Locke and Gournay, this thesis highlights a new interpretative grid, a rniddle position, in which the republican language of Mably secures his theory of natural law."
"In France, where fishing rights are non-transferable, the management of fishing quotas is essentially delegated to producer organizations (POs). POs are granted collective allocations based on the aggregate fishing rights of their members and are then responsible for managing their fishing opportunities. The goal of this research, which contains theoretical developments as well as empirical analyses applied to the Bay of Biscay sole fishery, is to determine how outcomes of fisheries management are altered by the presence of POs within institutions as compared to alternative governance systems such as individual transferable quotas (ITQs). This dissertation notably brings together bio-economic approaches and institutional analyses to better anticipate the ecological, economic and social impacts of potential governance options. The research questions are the following: (1) What mechanisms could ensure a high level of compliance and what are the potential gains of placing the POs between the regulator and the fishermen? (2) What are the distributional effects of catch share management by POs? (3) What is the added value of integrating institutional arrangements involving POs into bio-economic modelling for the impact assessment of catch share management options? The analyses that were developed establish the ability of institutional design to influence outcomes in catch share systems in terms of compliance, distribution, and ecological-socioeconomic trade-offs achieved by alternative management options."

"In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, France has set Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction targets of 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. More recently, Mexico has set the objective to achieve a 50% reduction by 2050 with respect to the base year 2000. Since the transport sector in urban areas with approximately 1 million inhabitants accounts for most CO2 emissions and will continue to increase its share, we wanted to determine to what extent the experiences observed in cities from developed countries (peak travel, dissemination of new vehicle technologies) may be repeated in urban areas from developing nations. For this purpose, we focus on case studies in France (Paris and Lille) and Mexico (Juarez and Puebla). The first objective of this thesis was to identify the determinants of mobility on each urban region. The second objective was to apply the age-cohort model for the development of long-term travel demand forecasts in order to take into account changes in the population structure (ageing) and in travel behaviour. The last objective was to develop GHG emissions assessments from observed travel demand. The decline in mobility and the dissemination of new vehicle technologies in France led to a reduction in GHG emissions. However, these changes are not sufficient to achieve the GHG reduction targets. The case studies in Mexico show the inability to reverse the trend towards the increase of GHG emissions; therefore the reduction targets will be hardly achieved. The case of Mexico give us an overview of trends in emerging countries, which are very far from achieving sustainable development and will face a major challenge in the coming decades."
"With the renewal of financial cycles and the subprime crisis, literature had focused on the macroeconomic influence of the financial factors. From the credit market, it mainly developed along the theory of financial accelerator (Bernanke and Gertler [1989], Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist [1999]) which is based on the hypothesis of asymmetric information. This thesis gives aim to complete this literature by considering that credit supply must be also considered in radical uncertainty and to return on it by proposing, from some of its own limits, another mechanism of financial accelerator which can be viewed as more macroeconomic. So, it leads us to improve our understanding of the credit market in the explanation of macroeconomic fluctuations and to reconsider economic policy related."
"The competitiveness agreement of the productive fruit chain of the Department of Huila has prioritized the Passion fruits as a productive bet. The Passion fruit sector is characterized by the dispersion of the planted areas without specialization and like a supplement income of the main productive activity.The main objective of this research was the identification of labor skills of the passion flower producers in Huila and its relationship with the level of regional competitiveness. For that the current state of labor skills has been identified, the link between labor skills and competitiveness for the Passion fruit sector was established and the reinforcement levels of producer labor skills to the sector productivity was also verified.The research method is positivist, the rationing mode is abduction, the search process is the hybrid exploration, the methodological approach is mixed and the access strategy to reality is the case study. This research, in general, determines the labor skills of Passion fruits producers in the department of Huila and establishes relationships between them and the regional competitiveness plan.The search results show a Passion fruit producer with low levels of education, manual work, little use of technology, with low associativity and expectative of official support by government agencies and industry leaders."
"In economics, it is today usual to use search models to modelize labor market, and assess public policy on this market. In this thesis, we introduce the age heterogeneity of workers in a search model which takes into account both labor market flows and endogenous wage distribution. We show that this heterogeneity affects greatly agents' economic behaviors in terms of wage setting, search intensity, and matches' productivity, by its two dimensions, the workers' experience and the workers' horizon. This model allows us to decompose  the wage trajectory of workers over their life cycle into three main channels : the wage game, the human capital accumulation and the presence of institutions. Besides, we show that this last channel, as composed of unemployment benefits indexed on workers' last wage, accounts for the simultaneous strong wage progression and weak workers' mobility observed in the French data. Yet, the horizon can also be technological : firms' embodied technology becomes obsolete with time. Given this technological horizon, the presence of tenure-growing unemployement benefits yields a distorsion which fastens obsolescence. In this context, only a tenure-growing firing tax allows the economy to reach its social optimum."
"The goal of this thesis is twofold: (1) uncover the sources of labor market fluctuations and evaluate their costs, (2) understand whether monetary policy should be concerned with stabilizing these fluctuations. More precisely, it addresses a certain number of intertwined questions. First, which disturbances underlie labor market fluctuations? Do they find their origin within or outside the labor market? Second, are there key characteristics of the labor market that tend to amplify or dampen the effects of these shocks on economic activity? Third, how costly are these fluctuations, and what does this imply for stabilization policies, especially monetary policy? The first chapter addresses the first question. It identifies and quantifies the importance for economic fluctuations of two labor market shocks, a labor supply shock and a wage bargaining shock, within a Vector Auto Regressive (VAR) mode!. The shocks are identified with sign restrictions. The main result that emerges from this analysis is that both shocks are important for output and unemployment fluctuations in the short run and in the long run. The second chapter is related to the literature that argues that wage rigidity is key to explaining the size of labor market fluctuations. It derives an analytical solution for the wage from an alternating-offer wage bargaining game à la Hall and Milgrom (2008) under a plausible parameter restriction. The third chapter addresses the third question. It tries to understand how the nature of unemployment fluctuations shapes the optimal design of monetary policy. It shows that, when unemployment fluctuations are asymmetric, the standard macroeconomic trade­-off between inflation and unemployment stabilization becomes a trade-off between inflation stabilization and average unemployment. In this environment, it is optimal for the central bank to adopt a dual mandate, that is, a policy that features a strong response to employment alongside inflation. The welfare gains of adopting this policy rather than a policy of price stability are found to be substantial."
"This thesis sheds light on the role of social movement organizations in the developement of nascent sectors that are aligned with the values of a social movement.The first research chapter questions the assumption that activists and firms have divergent interests, and the emphasis on the confrontational role of social movements.Propositions are developed to explain why non-oppositional social movement organizations' (SMOs) actions matter for fims, and when SMOs willl influence firms' strategic behavior.The second research chapter investigates whether support for social movement organizations sympathetic to an industry is linked to increased commitments of firms to the focal sector.Using a unique longitudinal dataset of European solar cell producers, this hypothesis is tested empirically and confirmed; further, it is demonstrated that the type of firms and their prior commitments moderate the link between SMO support and increased firm commitment to the industry.The last research chapter investigates the enactment of favorable policies for solar energy across EU countries. Empirical findings suggest that such policies can be partly explained by the interaction between de novo firm density in a country and SMO support. This dissertation contributes to strategic management, social movement theory, and studies of industry creation"
"This dissertation looks into performance implications of firms’ non-market strategies. It draws attention to the double-blade nature of firms’ non-market strategies, as well as the importance for the firm of forming a right portfolio of such strategies. Using insights from social exchange theory and resource dependence theory, it first outlines the conditions under which firms will be subject to rent extraction by politicians. It then looks into the impact of political linkages on firms’ financial performance, differentiating between different types of political linkages; which expose a firm to different levels of uncertainty regarding the continuity of exchange with the politician, and different levels of ex-post dependency on the politician. Finally it investigates how community engagement might act as a complement to firms’ political linkages, and how such complementarity may help to achieve improved financial returns from those political linkages. The predictions of the essays are empirically tested using a unique longitudinal dataset covering various types of linkages between all politicians and all publicly listed companies in the UK, for the period from 2002 to 2011. Taking a critical stand on the value to be drawn from firms’ non-market strategies, this dissertation contributes to strategic management literature, particularly the literature on firms’ non-market strategies and their implications on financial performance"
"Fleet management is a major concern for international humanitarian organizations because of (1) the magnitude of transportation related costs in humanitarian operations, second only to personnel cost and, (2) the pivotal role that transportation plays in the order fulfillment process. Humanitarian organizations face unusual operating constraints, which include working in areas with poor infrastructure, extreme environmental conditions as well as budget limitations. Most of the existing models derived from commercial supply chains are inapplicable in such a context. Therefore, a new set of tools and theories is required. This dissertation contributes to the development of such a new set of tools. It is composed of two parts that address two related questions in humanitarian fleet management: (1) how to determine the optimal fleet size and the optimal procurement strategy at an aggregate level and, (2) how to optimally manage an existing fleet the field level. Lack of data is the main challenge that prevents humanitarian organizations from adopting data-intensive models developed for commercial supply chains. Accordingly, the first part of this thesis studies how to determine optimal fleet capacity over time and how to minimize procurement costs for different demand profiles in the absence of detailed data. Contrary to conventional wisdom in humanitarian organizations, its findings show that a mixed policy of level and chase procurement strategies minimizes procurement costs and that a level strategy is the optimal approach to procurement in most humanitarian missions. The second part of the dissertation concentrates on fleet management policies at the field level. To optimize fleet performance and maximize demand coverage, humanitarian organizations implement policies to enhance the utilization of vehicles and minimize their physical depreciation. Through the analysis of a large humanitarian organization’s fleet in four representative countries (Sudan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Georgia) the results of this dissertation suggest that: (1) it is not necessary to assign different vehicles to specific mission types (2) all vehicles should be used following the same usage policy regardless of their mission type and, (3) the vehicle replacement policy implemented by most humanitarian organizations is not effective and needs to be reconsidered. Results also demonstrate that, on average, a utilization-depreciation trade-off does not exist and that a wellconceived fleet management policy can allow for both higher vehicle utilization and lower depreciation."
"The domain of sales management research for luxury products is still nascent. With the persistent growth of luxury brands and ongoing optimistic projections for the future, it is imperative to take a step forward in this field and understand the triggers that enable luxury sales. The personal luxury goods industry operates via two routes to market – “retail” (directly controlled by luxury brand manufacturers) and “wholesale” (outside of luxury brand manufacturer’s control). A significant amount of sales happen via the “wholesale” route, in multi-brand stores where a mix of luxury brands co-exists with non-luxury brands. Drawing from a literature on cognitive dissonance and social identity theory, using multilevel methods, this dissertation raises the question of how to predict salespeople’s effort allocation towards a focal luxury brand in this multi-brand selling environment"
"Global warming is nowadays a significant issue. Firms respond to this challenge by, among others, voluntarily disclosing information about their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Three empirical studies, each dealing with one dimension of the disclosure strategy, are conducted. They are all based on the Carbon Disclosure Project program. The first study identifies two sequential steps leading to information disclosure: information production and selective disclosure. A costs-benefits analysis is performed on a global sample in order to identify the different determinants of the two decisions and calls for a finer consideration of the disclosure process. The second study examines the influence of internal corporate governance on the quality of carbon information disclosed. Environmental-specific governance is distinguished from general governance. In the American context, analyses show that the role of the environmental-specific governance is contingent: its positive influence is moderated by the general governance context. The third study focuses on the concurrent use of two disclosure channels. It appears that French firms adapt the content of their GHG emissions indicator to the channel and the target audience. To ensure data credibility, information traceability is sustained in this case.Overall, this dissertation contributes to our understanding of the way stakeholders’ needs are managed by companies. Our knowledge of the informational environment created by firms about global warming is thus improved."
"This dissertation explores how intraorganizational networks and interorganizational collaboration, individually and jointly, shape firm innovation. Organizations rely on both external and internal collaboration to obtain and integrate knowledge in new products and processes. Internal collaboration networks among R&D scientists facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer whereas external collaboration via alliances and joint ventures provide an organization with access to new knowledge. This model is empirically tested in the North-American medical devices industry between 1990 and 2005. Contrary to the expectations, more cohesive and clustered intrafirm networks actually reduce knowledge transfer and diversity, which then reduces firm innovation. But well-connected intrafirm networks augment the effects of interorganizational collaboration on firm innovation. This dissertation contributes to the networks and innovation literature by examining the mechanisms that mediate the effects of network structure on firm innovation. It also explores the multilevel nature of networks by combining both intrafirm and interfirm relationships to explain firm innovation"
"This dissertation explores the antecedents and outcomes of organizational illegitimacy. How do organizational illegitimacy emerge? Why does it persist? Using an institutional logis perspective, I investigate the materialization of a stigmatized category, and how variance in disapproval within this category can signal proximity to a field-level logic and yield beneficial outcomes.The stakes of transferring and manipulating illegitimacy set the stage for blame games at the field of organizational level. These questions are examined in the empirical context of the US investment banking industry in the aftermath of the 2007 crisis. I focus in particular on its perception in print media. This work sheds light on the strategic nature of negative social evaluations, and provides implications for corporate image management and policy practice"
"Cultural values and their impact on people’s attitudes and behavior have long been a place for debate. Globalization, migration and expatriation have contributed to the conflict caused by the interaction among multiple cultural identities, particularly when it comes to organizations with diverse workforce. Specifically, France is a unique case that provides a historically and culturally rich, yet very ambiguous context for studying this topic. The dominant culture in France emphasizes on egalitarianism and secularism. However, a great part of the population has adopted distinct cultural values with regard to their religious beliefs. Moreover, the perception about ‘equal opportunities’ provided by the society varies considerably across the cultures. The topic is specifically important at workplace, where individuals with diverse and sometimes divergent beliefs take part in collective activities. The objective of this dissertation is to discover the mechanisms by which cultural attributes predict work ethic and productivity- first, through their interaction with religious beliefs; and second through the implicit theories about the societal structure. The findings reveal that religious thoughts positively influence work ethic and level effort when a culture of religiosity is prominent and negatively when the laïc culture is salient. Furthermore, this research sheds light to the different perceptions about equal opportunities in the society. The meritocratic attitudes are directly influenced by the extent to which people perceive the social structure to be malleable vs. fixed. Across three essays, this dissertation addresses a particularly important issue as faced by employers and policy makers, specifically in France. It provides a compelling understanding about a number of antecedents of work ethic and work behavior; namely, the cultural and religious values, perceptions about malleability of the social structure, and mindsets."
"This dissertation is made of three distinct chapters. The first chapter shows that managers overreact to salient risks. They respond to the occurrence of a hurricane event when their firms are located in the neighborhood of the disaster area. The sudden shock to the perceived liquidity risk leads them to temporarily increase the amount of corporate cash holdings, even though the real liquidity risk remains unchanged. The second chapter examines earnings announcements by US firms, and how far in advance notice of the event is given (the ""advance notice period""). Such advance notice period affects how much investors pay attention to earning news. This variation in investors' attention affects short-run and long-run stock prices, thereby creating incentives for firms to strategically reduce the advance notice period when they plan to disclose bad news. The third chapter studies M&A league tables, which provide rankings of investment banks. The rank of a bank in the league table predicts its future deal flow. This creates strong incentives for banks to manage their ranks in the league table."
"Product design stage is utterly important for successful product development, as up to 90% of the product costs are locked in during the concept and design engineering phases. At these phases, manufacturers of new products actively involve their suppliers to participate in product development. However, academic literature has not given sufficient attention to the link between the early supplier involvement stage and the subsequent mass production stage. The goals of the product developing manufacturer and its suppliers are not necessarily aligned, which can result in serious inefficiencies. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to resolve the conflict of incentives at the product design stage when a manufacturer of a new product involves a supplier of a key component. This thesis considers three important facets of collaborative product development: (1) multiple alternative designs of the key component, (2) parallel component development by several suppliers, and (3) testing of the key component by the supplier in order to learn its quality. Relying on the methodology of non-cooperative game theory, the thesis provides practical prescriptions on how to mitigate the incentive misalignment in each of the three cases."
"Probability and causality are two indispensable tools for addressing situations of social risk. Causal relations are the foundation for building risk assessment models and identifying risk prevention, mitigation and compensation measures. Probability enables us to quantify risk assessments and to calibrate intervention measures. It therefore seems not only natural, but also necessary to make the role of causality and probability explicit in the definition of decision problems in situations of social risk. Such is the aim of this thesis.By reviewing the terminology of risk and the logic of public interventions in various fields of social risk, we gain a better understanding of the notion and of the issues that one faces when trying to model it. We further elaborate our analysis in the case of nuclear safety, examining in detail how methods and policies have been developed in this field and how they have evolved through time. This leads to a number of observations concerning risk and safety assessments.Generalising the concept of intervention in a Bayesian network allows us to develop a variety of causal Bayesian networks adapted to our needs. In this framework, we propose a definition of risk which seems to be relevant for a broad range of issues. We then offer simple applications of our model to specific aspects of the Fukushima accident and other nuclear safety problems. In addition to specific lessons, the analysis leads to the conclusion that a systematic approach for identifying uncertainties is needed in this area.When applied to decision theory, our tool evolves into a dynamic decision model in which acts cause consequencesand are causally interconnected. The model provides a causal interpretation of Savage’s conceptual framework, solves some of its paradoxes and clarifies certain aspects. It leads us to considering uncertainty with regard to a problem’s causal structure as the source of ambiguity in decision-making, an interpretation which corresponds to a common understanding of the precautionary principle."
"I study infinitely repeated games with imperfect private monitoring played on networks. Different networks may represent the structures of interaction, of monitoring, and of communication of the repeated game. Communication is costless, and may be either private or public. I study different models of repeated games, depending on the networks considered, on the nature of communication, and on the solution concept. The aim of this thesis is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the networks for a folk theorem to hold"
"This dissertation consists of four distinct chapters.The first chapter presents the joint work with Christophe Spaenjers.We find that individuals with longer subjective life horizons hold higher conditional equity shares, and the effect of a shortening life horizon on portolio choice is offset by bequest motives. In the second chapter,I examine the explanatory power of birth order to financial household decisions. I show that firstborns differ in their financial decision-making from later born siblings. The results highlight the importance of personal family experiences for household choices. In the third chapter,I document that, in surveys, the presence of companions decreases the probability of respondents replying, and increases the probability of respondents overreporting their self-assessed abilities. The overreporting leads to a downward bias in the estimates of the importance of overconfidence for individuals' behavior. The fourth chapter presents joint work with Thomas Bourveau and François Brochet. We identify M&A lawsuits, where plaintiffs allege that the firm hid poor performance related to prior acquisition. Using the filing of a lawsuit as an industry shock, we show findings consistent with a disciplining effect from the lawsuit for the investment behavior of peer firms' managers"
"Difficulties of the central bank of Vietnam during the last decade in controlling price inflation and securing its inflation goals have launched and nurtured a vigorous debate on whether the current monetary policy strategy, in place since 1992 remains always appropriate. lnspired of this idea, this thesis aims to examine the relevance of the quantitative monetary targeting framework. Furthermore, the thesis recommends some arrangement in order to improve monetary policy efficiency. After an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 propose the state of the art of the economy of Vietnam. Two following chapters investigate the conditions that an effective money targeting strategy requires and whether they are fully satisfied in Vietnam. Indeed, the existence of a stable money demand function in the long run is considered in Chapter 3, and a significant predictive power that money should have on inflation is tested in Chapter 4. It is proved that the money demand function is stable and the hypothesis according to which money growth may forecast future inflation cannot be rejected. The monetary targeting is therefore still relevant for Vietnam. The last two chapters compute and suggest various monetary policy indicators by means of exhaustive evaluation exercises. Different core inflation measure and a composite index of financial conditions are introduced, which are justified to be meaningful for the policy making process of the central bank."
"This thesis deals with structuration in ordinary consumption activities (Gronow and Warde, 2001 ; Carù and Cova, 2003, 2007). Structuration is about the process of social relationships that structure in time and space through the duality of the structural. This means that individuals and collectives that interrelate in social systems, are co-created in structures. In this framework, social systems are both conditions and results of activities performed by agents who belong to these systems (Giddens, 1987). We propose a case study that builds on two different theoretical perspectives to investigate structuration in ordinary consumption. Our case is mostly built on consumers’ narratives about their trajectories in online discussion forums, and especially one of them called Jeuxvideo.com. In the first study, structuration is enlightened by revealing sensemaking processes in ordinary consumption experiences. In the second study, we focus on the mechanisms leading to the construction of the self considered in its complexity. This thesis intends to contribute both to a development of a new approach of consumption and to a better knowledge about structuration."
"The early 2000s were marked by an increasingly loud debate on the ability of French wine industry institutions to keep up with changing market demand and global competition. This thesis proposes a meso-level framework that follows the tradition of historical institutionalism. Our approach has been tailored to the analysis of production systems where the interplay between territory and sector is very important. Based on this framework, we focus on the articulation of the macro-meso- and microeconomic levels, on the political work of stakeholders in the wine industry and on the resources of patrimonial nature that ensure its persistence. The application of this methodology has made possible an analysis of the continuance of the French wine production system until the 1970s, the factors of its destabilisation at the end of the 20th century and the adaptation of the system in the 2000s. This thesis also emphasises the variety of the French wine production system, which is composed of diverse wine regions. Our analysis highlights the different historical trajectories of the three main French wine producing regions – Languedoc, Champagne and Bordeaux – and hence the difference in their capacity to adapt to the changes of demand and global competition. Finally, we highlight the diversity of actors in the industry in question by analysing the productive models of Bordeaux wine merchants."
"The experience of the recent financial crisis has strengthened the importance of the introduction of uncertainty inthe monetary policy design. This thesis has the objective to assess different implications of the uncertainty in themonetary policy strategy conducted within the BEAC. For this, we have evaluated the degree of independence ofthat institution and one of the prominent results was the requirement for central banks to be more independentbeside their governments, especially during financial stress period, in order to give more credit to policyimplementation. After an identification of different forms of uncertainty that may characterize the specificcontext of the CEMAC zone, it has appeared in our study that the heterogeneity problem of monetary policytransmission in this monetary union is the main source of uncertainty for policymakers. Through a simpledescriptive analysis, we were able to evaluate asymmetries transmission. The study reveals that theimplementation of an expansionary monetary policy, characterized by an increase of the money supply does notnecessarily provide the same effects from one country to another. Although the analysis of heterogeneity revealsheterogeneous financial structures, the heterogeneity problem in this area especially concern the transmissionlags of monetary policy, leading countries to adopt pro-cyclical fiscal policies in order to respond to shocks.These findings are reinforced by an analysis of the process of economic convergence of the members countriesof the zone through the multilateral surveillance mechanism, and despite the efforts in terms of integration, somedifferences still exist between those countries, particularly in term of fiscal policy."
"Tourism is a significant resource for Tunisia. Its economic impacts on the country are considerable (6% of GDP and over 386 000 direct and indirect jobs in 2009). But today, the tourism sector is facing many difficulties. This thesis is part of a plan to boost tourism in Tunisia. It is structured in two parts. The first diagnosis of the Tunisian tourism sector shows that it suffers on two levels: strategic (management is left to the private sector without government intervention, which leads to low profitability of some hotels, a high debt because of the pricing practice and the family business model) and qualitative (over-reliance on the Fordist model). The thesis discusses the limitations of Fordism quantitative, and demonstrates that a new reading of the tourism market is needed to achieve sustainable economic performance. From this perspective, the implementation of economic and environmental assessments is required. In the second part on the thesis, envisions a new trajectory for a specific territory (Djerba Island), it is to think of new trajectories. The work demands the search of relevant indicators of economic and environmental quality in order to assess the best methodologies to improve the assessment of the profitability of the tourism sector. Economically, the study proposes a new method for assessing the economic impact of tourism on the island of Djerba. This method called ""method of the masses"", builds on the theory of growth or development. It requires the determination of direct, indirect and induced activities. The indicators measured are: Value Added (VA), Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Employment (E). The results show that the most direct activities that generate wealth and jobs are hotels. For indirect activities, it is the consumption of food products, agricultural products and fisheries. These results may provide a basis upon which for policy-makers may evaluate future tourism development projects. In terms of assessing the importance of the environment, it allows the Djerbian tourism to defend its future. This evaluation will also examine the environmental dimension and provides an analysis of regulatory instruments in place in Djerba and seeks to integrate new instruments proposed by the World Tourism Organization which objective is to search for sustainable development of tourism activity to conserve the natural wealth of the island."

"After having accompanied the industrial revolution in the 19th century, rail transport difficultly adapt to the challenges launched by the road since a hundred years. Nowadays, European rail transport suffers from competition from the road, both for travellers and cargo. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the role of the railways in the goods and passengers transport has been declining. In the countries of the European Union, it now does ensure only 6% of passenger transport and 16% of goods transport. The European rail transport renewal is also marked by the development of the high-speed train. Total passenger ""high speed"" traffic is 15 billion passenger-km in 1990 against 111 billion passenger-km in 2014, that is an overall growth of 740%. The share of total passenger ""high speed"" traffic has increased from 4% in 1990 to 25% in 2014.The obvious observation is that, since the beginning of the 1990s, the railways have lost market share and therefore required growing subsidies.The need to improve this situation led to imagine a wide range of possibilities for action by national and European public authorities. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the European Commission is engaged in a vast reform aiming at the construction of an integrated railway area.In a context of European rail slump, we want to appreciate the performance of the railways in order to identify the main factors that will avoid the decline. We start from the idea that railways must be efficient in terms of production and commercialization of services.Each of the four chapters of this thesis uses various methods to contribute to the growing field of the rail transport.The first chapter uses the partial measures of productivity indicators to evaluate the performance of a panel of four European railway companies, the DB in Germany, SNCF in France, the RENFE in Spain and FS in Italy, observed between 1990 and 2012. Our aim here is twofold, to take stock of the current situation and reveal the path of major European rail companies on a period starting a little before the railway reforms initiated by the European Commission. These indicators help us to evaluate four areas of performance: productive performance, business performance, economic performance and financial performance. It is for us the opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of the directive 91-440 of 29 July 1991 relating to the development of Community railways, directive that recommends to promote the independence of management of railway companies, as well as their financial clean-up, especially their deleveraging. The second chapter shows the theoretical framework of technical efficiency, by a review of the theoretical foundations and by presenting the methodology of the borders. To complete this analysis, we propose a review of non-exhaustive literature of empirical studies on the evaluation of the performance of the railways. The third chapter suggests empirical contributions to the measurement of the performance of the railways. It is for us the opportunity to evaluate, compare and explain the differences in performance of some countries of the European union. Four performance indicators have caught our attention: productive efficiency, trade efficiency, technical efficiency and the variation of the total factor productivity. To this end, we simultaneously estimated three parametric and stochastic borders, namely, a production-oriented input border, a border of consumption and a border of technical efficiency-oriented input......"
"Due to seasonal blooms of green macro-algae belonging to the ulvaceae family, green tides are part of the larger class of harmful algal blooms (HAB), which has developed worldwide at a high rate during the last three decades, favoured by the eutrophisation of coastal waters due to human activities. The massive accumulation of seaweeds on the shore resulting from green tides generates a variety of damages to market and non-market activities, and is a potential threat to human health. In the same time, green algae are a natural resource that may be turned into a variety of valuable products through industrial processing. R&D programs devoted to this subject have been launched in countries subject to green tides, such as China and France.The subject of this dissertation is the economic assessment of green tides, in a cost-benefit perspective. To this end, it studies the costs of green tides for private agents and public bodies, as well as the benefits due to the processing of algae.The dissertation relies on two case studies, one in China (Yellow Sea), and the other in France (Brittany). Chapter 1 and chapter 2 are dedicated to the case of the green tides that have developed each spring in the Yellow Sea and reached the southern shore of the Shandong province during the last decade. Chapter 1 investigates the bio-economic mechanisms of these episodes, their economic consequences, public management policies, and stakeholders’ perceptions. Chapter 2 tries to quantify the social cost of green tides, including management costs (minus benefits generated by green algae processing) and residual costs to market and non-market activities. Chapter 3 relies on the Brittany case, and focuses on the economic consequences of green algae industrial processing. Making use of a regionalized input-output table, it estimates, at various geographical scales, the economic impact of a program concerning the industrial processing of algae that are collected during the green tides on the Brittany shoreline."
"As the concept of “territorial development” is still relatively ambiguous, this thesis proposes both a more rigorous and widerapproach than merely identifying it with the “economic development on a local area”. Our analysis goes through four distinct phases, each ofthem being dealt with in a different chapter.First, a brief historical analysis of relations between economic and political thoughts, in the sense of community affairsmanagement, emphasizes the reasons which allowed the economic sphere to progressively become more and more influential to the point toestablish itself as the finality of development and go over its status of a “tool”. Indeed, upon certain conditions, this shift can be justified,namely in presence of some scarcity of means in order to satisfy one’s own needs.Because making the concept of territorial development rely only on the economic aspect leads to implicitly consider the condition ofscarcity as permanent, we wished to verify if the current approaches to the economic theory were capable of taking into account the affluenceof developed countries. To this purpose, we relaxed the non-satiety hypothesis, which is implicit both in the convexity of the indifferencecurves in microeconomics and in the “psychological law” of Keynes’ General Theory.The extension of the economic theory to the condition of satiety, which was deeply looked into theoretically and checked against thereality all through the thesis, makes us gain a very unusual insight into economic phenomena. And, once the analysis was opened to therelations between different territories, we were able to demonstrate, from a purely economic point of view, the contradictory nature of theeconomic goals of development.Finally, taking territories as “social constructs”, the thesis suggests an alternative proposition, based on the freedoms to be and tomake, and their progressive enlargement, in a way close to Sen’s capability approach, yet not being a reduction of it. The proposed approachcouples coherently the economic and the non-economic spheres, in a development perspective which integrates completely the concept ofsustainability according to the proposition of the Brundtland Report, 1987, and it is summarized by a new synthetic development index, the“development space creation”."
"Structural change in farming has long been the subject of considerable interest among agricultural economists and policy makers. To account for heterogeneity in farmers’ behaviours, a mixture Markov modelling framework is applied to analyse this process for the first time in agricultural economics. The performance of this approach is first investigated using a restrictive form of the model, and its general form is then applied to study the impact of some drivers of structural change, including agricultural policy measures. To identify channels through which interdependency between neighbouring farms arises in this process, the mixture modelling approach is applied to analyse both farm survival and farm growth. The main conclusions of this thesis are threefoldFirstly, accounting for the generally unobserved heterogeneity in the transition process of farms allows better representing structural change in farming and leads to more accurate predictions of farm-size distributions than the models usually used so far. Secondly, the impacts of the main drivers of structural change themselves depend on the specific unobservable farm types which are revealed by the model. Lastly, the mixture modelling approach enables identifying different unobserved relationships between neighbouring farms that contributes to the structural change observed at an aggregate or regional level."
"This thesis aims to study the impact of feedback to households on their ability to control their electricity consumption and was based on an experiment conducted in the field, as part of a project called TicElec (Technologies de l'Information pour une Consommation Electrique Responsable), produced in the town of Biot, in Alpes-Maritimes (a department marked by power supply constraints in cold periods) and associating University, local authorities and a consulting firm. Our problematic which focused on the impact of several types of feedback (inspired by the typology of feedback developed by Darby (2006a)) applied to three groups of consumers over a period greater than six months, showed the existence of different consumer behavior and control of the electricity demand of households studied, more or less marked by the lack of information about their consumption patterns, that is to say, the weak link in energy management strategies. We also have shown that the results depend on the type of transmitted information, the nature and duration of feedback, but in general, the feedback on consumption (direct or indirect) was effective in controlling the application for electricity (by reduction and erasing peak), although the reduction was greater in groups direct feedback by acting on the Curtailment behavior, without triggering Efficiency behavior and Maintenance behavior, given the costs and time of implementation."
"This thesis analyzes the determinants of youth unemployment and the inequalities regarding entry on the labour market in Algeria, especially in terms of gender.The first research hypothesis holds some individual characteristics as factors predisposing at risk of unemployment. A typology is issued from a sample of unemployed from three regions (Bejaia, Tizi-Ouzou and Tlemcen), thanks to a Multiple Correspondence Analysis associated with an Ascending Hierarchical Classification; it reveals that youth unemployment is more urban mainly among women and the higher education graduates. Using a Logit model, we then show that age, human capital and gender affect significantly the likelihood of the active people to be unemployed rather than access employment in the region of Tizi-Ouzou.The second hypothesis is based on the “voluntary” nature of inactivity of women. The results of logistic regression performed on the sample of women in the Tizi-Ouzou region indicate that age, human capital and marital status are the most significant variables in driving women to inactivity.The third hypothesis suggests that discrimination against women is likely to be the cause of gender inequalities on the Algerian labour market. We explore the issue of hiring discrimination through the first correspondence testing conducted in Algeria (Oran). Against conventional wisdom, the analysis of gross and conditional discrimination reveals a marked preference towards female candidates applying for various job positions in the accounting profession."
"The objective of this work was to develop the framework of the new institutional economics to identify the economic constraints to overcome in order to encourage public or private agents to invest in restoring aquatic ecosystems. In the course of this work we mobilized different materials and methods that allowed us to identify three types of constraints: cost constraints, organizational constraints and institutional constraints.Our results show that these projects are exposed to a great variability of production costs, some key attributes play a decisive role in this variability: the type of targeted ecosystem, the institutional context, the initial degree of disturbance, the amount of works needed, the climate and the size of projects.Using the new institutional economics framework, we were interested in the transaction costs that surround investment project of restoring aquatic ecosystems. These costs are associated to the need of specific coordination devices between actors adapted to the complexity of biodiversity dynamics. Transaction costs originate from three different characteristics of projects: asset specificity, uncertainty and frequency of transactions. From the study of the market of wetland mitigation in the United States and of four case study in France, we show the link between the origin of transaction costs and organizational efficacy of the system. Among other results, we show that there is a tradeoff between an objective of challenging conservation and an objective of creating incentives for investment for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems."

"The main objective of this thesis is to study the interdependence of school resources and individual resources in human capital production. In three empirical analyses using French data, various methods arc proposed to evaluate the impact of educational policies, taking individual behaviors into account. The first chapter shows that compensatory education policies may result in individual sorting. The fact that socially more advantaged families tend to avoid treated schools cancels out additional resources positive effects on academic achievement. The second chapter examines whether pupils are constrained by local school supply. We find that opening a new high school increases the proportion of pupils who continue in upper secondary education, particularly in a vocational track. Studying how students evaluate teaching, the third chapter shows that they take contemporaneous information about their grades into account when they evaluate teachers' pedagogical qualities."
"What is Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and can it be demand-driven ? Is there a business case for corporates providing the public good or should it be solely provided by the government ? Are green products over-priced and should they be taxed ? If they are, who are the beneficiaries and who are the actual tax payers ? Will results differ whether the CSR investments in question complement or substitute for the government provision of public goods ? Chapter 1 of this Ph.D. dissertation will address these questions and create a conceptual framework for further analysis in subsequent chapters of CSR as a desirable activity whereby firms provide a public good alongside the private good they produce. One of the main issues that emerge from this analysis is the need to identify and explore a new kind of dichotomy, i.e. the trade-off between market provision of public goods via CSR and its public counterpart via the government. This question gains particular importance in the context of developing countries, as well as in some developed ones, where firms have strong political ties. In Chapter 2, it is shown that politically connected firms - or, at extreme, the business politicians - may try to influence the government to reduce its provision of the public good to maximize the reputational return on their CSR investments. The mechanism goes as follows. An underprovided public good offers the opportunity for large political benefits to firms stepping in the areas where the government fails to deliver through their CSR activities. Consumers are suspicious about the true motives for which firms engage in CSR, it may be out of benevolence or political greed, however, since all firms, including the greediest and the most prosocial ones participate, politics interfering with business does not spoil firms' image since those political benefits are so large that everyone does it. We refer to this phenomenon as corruption becoming a social norm. Chapter 3 provides a strategic explanation for this phenomenon of corruption being epidemic in the economy. It explains why corruption, in the form of bribe­taking, may become widespread among government agencies, for the mere reason that their efforts are interdependent."
"The transfer of scientific knowledge from the University to the industry encourageseconomic growth and innovation. One of the mechanisms allowing this transfer is the spin-offcompany. The creation of the latter from academia world involves a process initiated by theacademic researcher and expects the intervention of many actors. This process is consideredto belong, uncertain and less controllable. This research aims to understand this phenomenonthrough studying internal and external elements which limit or block the emergence of suchtypes of innovative companies.This study focuses on the Tunisian context, in which the creation of the university spinoffremains an uncommon and a poorly developed phenomenon. It was conducted through anempirical study organized in two steps (a synchronic exploratory study and a longitudinalstudy) that entrepreneur-researcher is encountered by a set of obstacles that delay or preventthe creation of the spin-off. Therefore, a classification scale of these obstacles is proposed inthis piece of research in order to clarify and specify the nature and the impact of each one onthe creation process. As a matter of fact, they can be related to the resources, entrepreneurialecosystem, University culture and legal regulation. In the light of these results, presented in aprocessual logic, recommendations were proposed in the form of policies and practices whoserole is to promote the creation activity of academic spin-offs. These recommendations can beuseful for entrepreneur-researchers, policy makers and academic leaders"
"Logistics activities are fundamental leverages for the productive systems’ efficiency, but also create a lot of jobs. However, logistics activities induce negative externalities: first, by the flows created by these activities, then by the facilities supporting it (infrastructures, equipment, buildings, etc.). To attract logistics activities, while reducing negative externalities, local public authorities use a certain number of regulatory tools. To that extent, a public policy is mostly used, pushed forward by modal report necessity linked with sustainable development: the logistics center, which is an area equipped in order to host logistics activities.This thesis focuses on the articulation between planning policies and regional economic development. The first part brings to light different roles played by logistics centers: two external roles, direct and indirect, and one internal. By using original methods and data, the second part of this thesis aims to test the validity of these different roles. The major result of this work is that by nature of logistics activities – which take part in enlarged chains and networks – the wider economic impacts of logistics centers are low"
"Industrial accident is one of the most destructive and unbearable crisis. In many cases, experience feedbacks show that the disaster could probably have been avoided. In this context, we come up the question of anticipation. In socio-technological systems with high-risk technology, what are the pathways to detect and prevent an accident sequence? To address this problem, our approach is based on decision making. Placed in a restrictive environment, operational management is a particular actor. A historical analysis of major accidents shows a gap between the vision of the manager, and the reality of operations. The manager is placed in a situation of ambiguity, in which he has to ensure the balance between the rupture requested by the safety requirement, and the absence of rupture imposed by the continuity of activities. Then, the challenges of complexity, time, and decision gradually degrade the decision-making environment and block the decision.Our thesis proposes an understanding and a modelisation of the decision ecosystem of the operational manager, in order to pass from a stressed situation to a situation where the decision becomes initiative. By make the decision of a prepared interruption, the manager strengths his anticipation capacity of major industrial accidents. By understanding its decision ecosystem operational manager can take initiatives that protect the continuity principle"
"In this thesis we study the application of Mean Field Game Theory in economics. This new branch of game theory is devoted to the study of systems involving a large number of interacting agents using the notion of mean field from Statistical Physics. This method reduces greatly the complexity of interactions. The first model is devoted to the study of Software market and shows that tolerance of piracy can be an effective strategy in order to limit the diffusion of free softwares. The second model is a static mean field game and addresses the problem of parking in cities by intro ducing heterogeneity among agents. This allows us to evaluate public policies. The third model analysis, in a dynamic setting, theconsequences of the choice of young researchers on the dynamics of science."
"The so called “citizen” funds are the organizations of social finance that collect funds, in the form of shares from physical persons in order to finance projects addressing social and/or political issues. They combine the necessary attention on the economic and financial sustainability with a political vill of social change. This work aims to precisely characterize the operating logics and to question their ability to coexist. The typology of the resources and the economic model of the citizen funds, the analysis of the legitating strategies through the speech as well as the relationship with the  public authorities reveal u four institutional logics: alternative, profit-oriented, public-oriented and logic of movement."
"The problematic of legal rulings concerning Occupational Health and Safety atwork (OHS) was absent from companies management policies for a long time, regardless of their size. However, because of legal, economic, social pressures and the development of normative references in the field of OHS (such as OHSAS 18001), employers are encouraged to develop more or less complex compliance management devices. Nevertheless, the implementation of a real Compliance Management System (CMS) forces to deploy important human, financial, time, methodological and technical resources. To face this situation, different categories of services providers henceforth propose monitoring and management solutions. Despite this, the study of companies state practices in the field of mastering OHS legal compliance shows that these practices are extremely heterogeneous and that needs concerning methods and data consolidation tools (compliance reports, action plans…) clearly appear. Based on these context elements, this research work proposes the modelling of a Compliance Management System responding to needs expressed by many companies to deal with aspects such as regulatory monitoring, compliance assessment and action plans management. To evaluate the interest and the relevance of the proposed model, several experimentations were conducted in companies. A synthesis of the results obtained is presented at the end of this research work."
"In our societies, where information is everywhere the capacity to capture and analyze this information is a major issue for every entity that must take a decision. From this capacity dependsthe efficiency of the actions and measures that will be undertaken. But face with the large increase of available data, the increasing number of actors and the increasing complexity of threats the strategic environment in which decision-makers operates is characterized by a significant uncertainty. This general observation is also present in the maritime domain characterised by heterogeneous threats, a large effective area and a large number of stakeholders.Therefore, this proposed research explores the potentiality of spatial ontologies for modelling, sharing and inference. The purpose is to provide a suitable environment for the experts where knowledge about abnormal maritime behaviour can be modelled. However, this knowledge is spatio-temporal. It has therefore been necessary to extend the initial functionality of the SWRL language to take into account these characteristics.Finally, the adopted approach has been had been implemented inside the OntoMap prototype. From retrieving the data to the cartographic analysis, this prototype offers all the necessary elements to understand an abnormal situation."
"Occupational health and safety (OHS) is at the heart of corporate policies and the increasing trend towards litigation has contributed to the inflated number of regulatory texts published each year. OHS professionals are therefore faced with the need to process a growing amount of data in order to remain in compliance. They train themselves in law, draw upon internal expertise (the company's legal department) or external consultants (advisory and enforcement agencies) and equip themselves with information systems. These systems are mainly ‘judicial monitoring' databases that contain regulatory texts and associated comments. For the most part, this data is complex to interpret and difficult to exploit given the growing number of texts, the expertise needed to understand them and the difficulty in being sure that they are relevant to the activities of the company. This need for clarity may be met by models and methods from artificial intelligence. Amongst these, we have selected the concepts of the ontology and the knowledge base. An ontology is a model of a particular domain of knowledge created for a specific purpose. A case study of the knowledge management is described as part of an experiment with a company in the energy production sector."
"Everyday thousands of trucks transporting hundreds of thousands of tons of dangerous goods by various modalities and both within and across nations. However, the term “dangerous” indicates an intrinsic adversity that characterize these products, which can manifest in an accident leading to release of a hazardous substance (e.g. radioactive, flammable, explosive etc.). In this situation, the consequences can be lethal to human beings, other living organisms and damage the environment and public/private properties.The importance of dangerous goods boils down to the significant economic benefits that generates. In fact, one cannot deny the contribution of the transport of all fossil fuel derived product, which represents more than 60% of dangerous goods transported in Europe. Eni, the Italian leading petrochemical company, every day operates a fleet of about 1,500 trucks, which performs numerous trips from loading terminals to filling stations. Distribution of petroleum products is a risky activity, and an accident during the transportation may lead to serious consequences.Aware of what is at stake, the division Eni R&M - Logistics Secondary, historically active in Genoa headquarters, is collaborating since 2002 with the DIBRIS department at University of Genoa, and the CRC at Mines ParisTech, with the purpose of studying possible improvements regarding safety in transport of dangerous goods, particularly petroleum products. Over years, this collaboration has led to the development of different technologies and mainly to an information and decision support system. The major component of this system is a platform for monitoring Eni fleet, at the national level, to deliver the products to the distribution points, called the Transport Integrated Platform (TIP). These vehicles are equipped with a device capable of transmitting data stream in real-time using a GPRS modem. The data transmitted can be of different nature and contain information about the state of the vehicle and occurred events during the trip. These data are intended to be received by centralized servers then get processed and stored, in order to support various applications within the TIP.With this in mind, the studies undertaken throughout the thesis are directed towards the development of a proposal to further minimize the risk related to the transportation of dangerous goods. In other words, a trade-off based model for route selection taking into consideration economic and safety factors. The objective is prompted by the need to support existent regulations and safety standards, which does not assure a full warranty against accidents involving dangerous goods.The goal is carried out by considering the existent system as basis for developing an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) aggregating multiple software platforms. These platforms should allow planners and decision makers to monitor in real-time their fleet, to assess risk and evaluate all possible routes, to simulate and create different scenarios, and to assist at finding solutions to particular problems.Throughout this dissertation, I highlight the motivation for such research work, the related problem statements, and the challenges in dangerous goods transport. I introduce the TIP as the core for the proposed ITS architecture. For simulation purposes, virtual vehicles are injected into the system. The management of the data collection was the subject of technical improvement for more reliability, efficiency and scalability in real-time monitoring of dangerous goods shipment.  Finally, I present a systematic explanation of the methodology for route optimization considering both economic and risk criteria. The risk is assessed based on various factors mainly the frequency of accident leading to hazardous substance release and its consequences. Uncertainty quantification in risk assessment is modelled using fuzzy sets theory."
"Tight VS loose coupling, managed VS enforced safety, engineering VS field knowledge... As they are now confronted with uncertain, complex environments, organizations manage safety by oscillating between rigid control and the flexibility required to manage hazards. At the heart of this tension rests the individual, who is able to determine whether following the rule is enough or if some level of adaptation is required. Yet this implies that the individual is no longer considered as a factor, neither of failure nor of reliability, but as a person who is autonomous and in a capacity to make enlightened, reasoned decisions. Building on Paul Ricoeur's practical philosophy, we develop the notion of « practical Safety ». It defends the idea that safety can be preserved by relying on people's practical reason rather than on organizational rationality, by mobilizing individual will rather than obedience. The PhD demonstrates that such an approach is both relevant and anchored in reality, using field data gathered within a gas distribution company."

"The industrial era and the subsequent development of the first modern socio-technical systems led to the necessity of taking risk into account. This concept, thought before the French Revolution on a theological basis, had to evolve in a more scientific direction. If the technical aspect focused interest at first, the human and organizational dimension had to be integrated, following major accidents. Risk management is a major concern for GrDF due to the nature of natural gas. Created recently, this company inherited a strong preoccupation for the reduction of risks. However, recent events demonstrated the existence of a threshold in this progression. The need for change led to the development of two important projects concerning the learning from past experience process and the formation process. First results show that a major evolution is reshaping managerial and field behaviors. Some perduring limits illustrates however that this change process faces strong resistance from an organization structured around the paradigm of technical safety. This case study first aims at identifying the key factors of success in such a process by developing a better understanding of managerial and operational trade-offs through observation."
"This doctoral thesis in management sciences questions the impacts of collaborations between companies and the non-governmental sphere. It takes into consideration the extent to which the NGOs contribute to the overall performance of firms through their social responsibility.The state-of-the-art of the key words with regards to our topic has highlighted a threefold expansion within companies: first, an openness of their governance which translates into the introduction of new stakeholders in the core of the society; secondly, a deepening of performance that is no longer observed solely from an economic and financial perspective but also from its social and environmental aspects; and finally, the development of performance measurement tools. As a matter of fact, economic reporting is now complemented by sustainable development reports. This expansion of measurement tools is sometimes characterized as an integrated reporting that systematizes the link between the financial and the extra-financial.The challenges of this qualitative research with an exploratory aim are threefold: firstly, it addresses understanding the involvement of the actors by characterizing their posture within partnerships but also by shedding light on their motivations to collaborate. Secondly, it is necessary to determine the modalities of the partnerships that exist between the firms and the NGOs, specifying the notion of ""dialogue"" and the characteristics of strategic partnerships. Finally, this research addresses measuring the contribution of NGOs to the overall performance by analyzing its impacts under the prism of a four-axial performance and more specifically using the methodology of Integrated Reporting.Our research has been materialized through a documentary and a statistical study of 301 companies and NGOs that revolved around their socio-economic sphere. Based on this sample, we further conducted 44 semi-structured interviews with companies and NGOs and completed our research with a case study on the strategic partnership between Michelin and WWF. In this case study we have on one hand interviewed internal stakeholders, such as those in charge of cooperation, and on the other hand, external stakeholders, such as the Deputy Managing Director of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) ) and the General Manager of the Union of Professionals for Tires (Syndicat des Professionnels du Pneu - SPP)."
"This thesis is a collection of political economy research topics fitting into the contemporary field of literature on the natural resource curse in developing countries. The thesis focuses primarily on the links between natural resource rents and political institutions, before studying the impact of oil resource rents on poverty under its different forms. The geographical scope of the thesis is both macro for a group of developing countries, and micro in the case of Chad and its regions. The first part, drawing on institutional change theories, tests the hypothesis on whether rents generated by natural resources have a detrimental effect on institutions in developing countries, by considering different types of natural resources characterized by their different degree of appropriability. Besides, we evaluate the hypothesis of a ""regional conflict system"" in the “tormented Triangle” which includes Central African Republic, Chad and Sudan. The second part assesses the impact of the “unusual” system for allocating and managing the expected oil income from the Doba Oil project on many aspects of poverty in Chad by using field survey data. As such, the first chapter of this part tests the hypothesis of an urban bias in children's time allocation in the oil context in Chad. Regarding the second chapter, it investigates the impact of oil extraction on poverty profile in the oil producing region by using quasi-experimental evaluation methods."
"The growing informal sector in Algeria has become a structural component of the economy. The old controversies on its role (dynamic, marginal or parasitic) are still going on and account for the complexity of the phenomenon. The subject matter of our thesis is to analyze the informal sector in Algeria, according to the ILO’s definition, in order to understand whether it is a dynamic or a subsistence sector. In this connection, we conducted a representative survey on a sample of 522 households in the wilaya of Bejaia, i.e. nearly 1000 employed workers. The cross-section analysis of the data, thanks to multivariate analysis (multiple correspondences) and the logistic regression, has identified the salient features of employees and self-employed of the informal sector. Thus, we distinguished various types (pure informal vs. hybrid informal; seamstresses, food sub-contractors and service providers homeworkers), which reflect its heterogeneity as regards the diversity of activitie s and actors, varying degrees of informality and income differentiation. The analysis of the informal workers’ mobility highlights strong intra-sectoral upward mobility within the informal sector and the segmentation between non-mobile and mobile self-employed. Low human capital and low income as well as weak linkages with the overall economy support the assumption of segmentation between the two sectors (formal and informal) as well as within the informal sector itself, but emphasize the existence of a large informal subsistence sector."
"In a context of development crisis which, the Lest Developed Countries (LDCs) are trapped in since their independences and faced to a persisting if not a contained expanding informal economy, micro enterprises are seen as a solution to boost dynamic Small Medium Sized business (SMEs) that can generate added value. Our reflection in this research project is to shed more light on the operational patterns of micro-enterprises and contribute to identify the main factors that determine their dynamism and thus, their transition to dynamic commercial SMEs. The project presents a synthesis of some of the different theories explaining the so-called informal economy and micro-enterprises. For this purpose, we have conducted a survey in 2012 among a sample of 205 urban micro-entrepreneurs in the Republic of Mali. Our research led us to accept and analyze the very existence and reality of the so-called informal economy; and study the operational logic of micro enterprises and thus come out with a typology of MSMEs into two main categories. The division is made according to the logic of operation and the size of the invested capital: enterprises for mere subsistence or commercial enterprises. For each category, appropriate incentive policies that can prompt micro enterprises to comply with formal legislation in force in the LDCs."
"As every socio-economic entities, the Very Small Business (VSB) / Small Business (SB) faces various risks related to its activities (fire, loss of an important supplier, work accident, failure in a partnership, industrial espionage,…). If large companies have at their disposal dedicated tools to manage them all and to ensure their durability, VSB / SB do not. Armed with this knowledge, the Group AFNOR (the French national body for standardization) in collaboration with the Center for research on Risks and Crisis of Mines ParisTech initiated a joint reflection to give an answer to this situation.This thesis presents the basis and the design of an approach for global risks mastery within VSB / SB. Obtained results of course concern to VSB / SB owners but also to all “intermediary actors” (businesses associations, (regional) chamber of commerce and industry, trade chambers, insurers,…) who accompany and support them in their risks management initiatives.It rests/is based on the definition and the construction of a diagnostic tool which allows to identify and to reduce the vulnerabilities of VSB / SB when they are confronted to their major risks. For this, the characterization of VSB / SB vulnerabilities led to highlight their transitory characteristic through the lifecycle concept. Once described, their modeling results in identifying criteria which explain variations of the nature and / or severity of damages when an event occurs. These criteria are the main constituents of the diagnostic tool. The latter allows to point the weaknesses of the enterprise in order to bring adapted improvements proposals/offers (training, specific diagnostic or self-diagnostic, coaching, consulting, sensitization,…)."
"Museums are increasingly developing international strategies to raise their profiles outside of home markets. How can we define this trend? A multiple correspondence analysis of a database, which is populated by the results of a survey that we conducted among international museums, reveals that museums fall into four categories regarding their internationalization strategies: ""elite"", entrepreneur-innovator"", ""entrepreneur-curator"" and ""artisan"" museums. Museums can have two complementary international strategies: one geared toward economic profitability or one geared toward the preservation of heritage. Traditional business models (dependent, independent, and mixed) face challenges from a decline in public subsidies, uncertainty surrounding private donations and stagnant ticket sales. The internationalization of museums have an impact on the historical models and contributes to the evolution of these business models. Two case studies illustrate the international characteristics and practices of museums: the Victoria & Albert Museum and the Musée des Arts et Métiers (Paris, France)."
"The thesis studies the influence of innate pre-existing behavioral biases for natural signals influencing product choice. By integrating evolutiannory concepts and theories from the discipline of behavioral ecology into the conceptual framework of the persuasion process on the one hand, and by the neurophysiological study of this processes on the other, this study offers a definition of the concepts of natural signals and pre-existing biases. Using the research protocol of behavioral ecology, the study shows that ripe fruits are natural signals. Their influence on the process of persuasion was tested by quantifying its effects on the following variables : selective attention, approach motivation, explicit and implicit memorization, explicit and implicit attitude as well as purchase intention. The results show that the color of a ripe fruit influences the persuasion process via a peripheral route without attracting attention, whereas the shape of the signal attracts selective attention and triggers a visual exploration behavior which improves memorization attitude and products choice. The study offers a theoretical framework for the study  of natural signals and their influence throughout different cultures and media and throughout various forms of marketing materials and communication devices."
"This thesis is composed of a set of research in applied economics that enroll in the contemporary field of economics of insurance. The thesis analyses how developing countries could develop more the insurance sector and benefit from these effects on local economy. The first part explored the determinants of insurance development from a macroeconomic perspective. First, the results show that increase of income per capita leads to an increase in life insurance premiums and that life insurance is a luxury commodity in Sub-Saharan Africa (chapter 2). We also find evidence that the marginal impact of income varies according to the quality of legal and political environment. Second, analysis of effect of the FDI inflows shows that these are a key factor in increase of non-life insurance premiums in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and in other developing countries (chapter 3). In chapter 4, the results highlighted that the activities of life insurance and banking are substitutable in SSA and, however, there is presence of unidirectional causality running from real private credit density to life insurance and insurance density. The second part of the thesis has analysed effect of development of insurance sector on economy in developing countries. First, it appears that the development of life insurance has a positive effect on economic growth on the one hand and on the other hand marginal effect of life insurance is influenced by the structural characteristics of countries (chapter 5). In chapter 6, the results showed that the insurance premiums significantly increase stock market value traded, before as well and after the 2007's economic crisis. Finally, the thesis showed that there is a long term relationship between the development of non-life insurance and trade openness and that non-life insurance premiums improve openness to international trade as well in developing countries than specifically in low and middle income countries (chapter 7)."
"We investigate how does a focal firm strategize and manage coopetition through the specific lens of knowledge sharing. Based on two case studies of two firms considered as masters in the management of coopetition, we identify three ways to create and pursue the focal firm’s current and future advantage in coopetitive project. The two first ways confirm the dominant research approach of coopetition which argues that a focal firm should obstruct or reduce to its strict minimum the coopetitor’s potential for internalizing the knowledge shared for the project success (i.e. reduce or restrict the focal firm’s knowledge transparency). Indeed, the value creation of a coopetitive project success can be jeopardized by the fear of knowledge sharing between competitors. The reduction or restriction of its knowledge transparency is a key organizational solution to overcome this fear of knowledge sharing and thus this fear of collaborating with a competitor. Alternatively, we identified a third way of strategizing and managing coopetition which goes one step further in coopetition. Indeed, by building on our empirical results, Deutsch’s theory of conflict resolution and Nonaka’s organizational knowledge creation theory, we argue that the creation and pursuit of current and future advantage for a focal firm in coopetitive project can also consist in implementing a strategy and management based on greater and freer transparency. In that case, the dominant coopetitive knowledge sharing adages of “protecting” or even “sharing and protecting” shift into “sharing and enabling for constructive capturing.” This third way opens academic research opportunities based our boarder theoretical roots than Hamel’s approach of inter-firm relationships in which the strategic intent is a learning race and one of the key organizational element is a minimized transparency. It also has managerial contributions. Indeed, it increases top management analytical capability by generating a new counter-intuitive insight: enabling a competitor in a coopetitive project can be strategic tool to create and pursue current and future advantage for themselves. Moreover, our integrated framework can be reused to train the analytical coopetitive capabilities of top managers by making them aware about three ways of strategizing and managing coopetition."
"This thesis brings ontology alignment to contribute to federated enterprise interoperability focusing on data interoperability at the semantic level. In response to existing problems and challenges, aiming at improving the matching ability and precision, a pattern-based core word ontology alignment approach is proposed, as well as an analytic matcher aggregation approach, which allows combining the multiple matchers automatically and improve the combined results. A prototype system is implemented for validation and further application based on the proposed approaches. The experiments suggest that the proposed approaches obtained promising results and reached expected goals. The proposed ontology alignment approach and implemented prototype system are applied to an ontology-driven architecture for querying data from multiple relational databases."
"The present manuscript tackles the supply chain forest transportation problem in the context of forestry primary industry. In this context, several risks may affect the forest supply chain: the unpredictable weather conditions (tree falling provoked by major storms); sanitary emergencies (tree pest and diseases); and, diverse commercial circumstances (the variability of market demands). The aforementioned issues motivate the diverse forest sector protagonists (entrepreneurs, forest operators and drivers) to seek support for improving their logistic operations. The aim of this effort is to improve the service quality (offer-demand agreement) diminishing in this way the total costs. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is the proposal of a novel management model which improves forest-to-mill transport performance. At the same time, the proposed model accounts for the forest sector manners and constraints. The contribution of this thesis is threefold: first a transportation model is developed, later on the transport planning is managed, and finally an optimization procedure is proposed.The thesis results propose a hierarchical planning for the forestry transportation. Two decision levels are suggested: tactic and operational. At a tactic level, a multi-period optimization is considered. The multi-period optimization strategy meets the customer supply demands while minimizes the global transportation activity. Such strategy takes into account the restrictions of the total available transportation means. Moreover, at this level the activity balancing politics may be developed, as well as subcontractors coordination between transport companies. On the other hand, at the operational level, the tactic planning assigned for each transporter is divided so an optimization of the fleet’s transport assignation is done considering the vehicles constraints.The decision process is modelled as a Mixed Linear Programming formulation. The application considers a data set coming from the industry settled at the Aquitaine region in France. The results have shown a significant improvement on the transport capabilities with respect to the conventional transport practices.It is worth to mention that the decision models were designed such that they may be adapted to different context either collaborative or not. In both cases, the tactic planning has a generic purpose, in other words, it is independent of the kind of organization involved, whereas specific organizations are taken into account when planning actors’ activities at the operational level."
"Theories in (New) Institutional Economics won recently the development debate. Meanwhile, the role of institutions is being taken into account progressively in development strategies analysis. Our research in Haitian Microfinance follows the same logic. Its fundamental idea is that development implies economic and social change and this is the result of a pattern of material and immaterial assets. Then, development is viewed as the process or outcome from the interaction of several capitals. In this study, we show that economic institutions structuring relations between economic agents are constitutive of a form of capital: the institutional capital. With an analysis based in the Haitian microfinancial intermediation, we find that institutional capital is a determinant condition for development strategies implementation. In microfinancial intermediation, institutional capital is a production of microfinance organizations. It influences users' behaviors of microfinancial services and generates economic and social outcomes. The main conclusion of our study using empirical evidence is the following: institutional capital matters, either for analytic purpose or as an asset used by economic agents to modify behaviors for change."
"Uncertainty hangs over rural households in developing countries. This thesis aims first to better understand the consequences of vulnerability on behavior and also to analyze the implementationand impact of risk management strategies, internal or external to the household. The first chapter concentrates on the effect of exposure to tenure insecurity in Angola on saving behavior. It states that households without document are not able to accumulate precautionary  saving. This behavior of self-Coverage only occurs with cumulated risks. The second chapter focuses on the decision-Making within the household for the choice of diversification strategies. The allocation of women working time in Senegal between domestic work and income generating activities is studied. A model of separate spheres with a transfer between spouses is validated. The low incidence of financial incentives and the importance of bargaining power are demonstrated. The last chapter analyzes the impact of external intervention on household vulnerability through a program which aims to develop access to energy services. Its impact is estimated on the nutrition of children. The results show a positive and progressive effect of the presence of the infrastructure on long- erm nutrition. The intensity of use reduces the short-Term malnutrition. A diffusion effect is also established. These three chapters allow to stress the inability of households to develop independent strategies against the vulnerability. Then they make out the need to develop market access in rural areas. Finally,the role of  external intervention to provide management tools to households is underlined"

"This dissertation investigates theoretically and empirically the interrelationships among population’s health,environmental degradation and economic development, its consequences for developing countries, and someeffective policy responses. The first part explores the association between health, environment, and inequalities. Itfirstly analyzes whether environmental degradation could be considered as an additional channel through whichincome inequality affects infant and child mortality (chapter 2). Theoretical and empirical investigations show thatincome inequality affects negatively air and water quality, and this in turn worsens population’s health. Therefore,environmental degradation is an important channel through which income inequality affects population health. Then,it is shown that sulphur dioxide emission (SO2) and particulate matter (PM10) are in part responsible for the largedisparities in infant and child mortalities between and within developing countries (chapter 3). In addition, we foundthat democratic institutions play the role of social protection by mitigating this effect for the poorest income classesand reducing the health inequality it provokes. The second part is devoted to the link among health, environment,and economic growth. The effect of health (global burden of disease, communicable disease, and malaria) oneconomic growth is assessed in Chapter 4. This chapter shows that health indicators, when correctly measured by thegap between current health status and an ideal health situation where the entire population lives to an advanced age,free of disease and disability, and when accurately instrumented have significant impact on economic performance.The consequences of these interrelationships on the convergence of poor countries towards their steady state aretheoretically and empirically investigated in the last Chapter (chapter 5). It is found that environment degradationreduces the ability of poor countries to reach their own steady state, reinforcing our argument according to whichenvironment quality improvement plays a considerable role in economic convergence process. Moreover, thedegradation of air and water quality affects negatively economic performance, and health status remains an importantchannel through which environment degradation affects economic growth even if it is not alone. The EnvironmentalKuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is also verified."

"The object of this research is to study the antecedents of the consumer’s intention of MMO/MMORPG by supporting the definition of Bell (2008), which is offering a consensus on the definition of the virtual worlds. By this definition, all the virtual worlds have three concepts which are inherent to them: the presence of social interactions, persistence and avatar. We adapted the model of technological acceptance by representing these three concepts by social identity at which we distinguished the MMO community and the Guild community, perception of the flow and avatar. Our work follows a hypothetico-deductive method, which was formalized by the development of a qualitative and a quantitative analysis, using structural equations method. The results showed that the motivational factors (Yee 2007) of achievement and immersion influence significantly and positively the personalization of the determinants of the avatar (physique, clothing and attitudes), a contrario of the factor of sociability which influences it negatively. The three concepts which are inherent to virtual worlds have a positive influence on the attitude which, itself, influences positively the intention. Our adaptation of the model of technological acceptance, by jointly integrating the three concepts of the MMO/MMORPG which are social identity, perception of the flow and personalization of the criteria of the avatar, explains to 27,4% the consumer’s intention of virtual worlds."
"Stated preference surveys are based on choice sets composed by the analyst and proposed to some respondents. Each situation of the choice set is the combination of pre-determined attributes. While declaring the choice they would make if they were confronted to the same situation in reality, respondents reveal their preferences and their perceptions of the attributes.This Phd work presents the results of three stated preference surveys applied in the camp of public transportation. All surveys form a part of more general research programs handled for the sake: of the French railway operator, known as the SNCF (2006/2007) ; of the French railway network administrator, called RFF (2008) ; and of the French research, experimentation and innovation  program in land transport, named PREDIT (2010). The use of stated preference methodology was required in order to deal efficiently with the issues of each of those research programs (respectively treating of social pricing ; train supply policy ; fuel rationing policies). The conception, the implementation and the analysis of the surveys have all been carried out during this Phd work in order to warranty control of each parameter and thus high quality results.In accordance with program research objectives, different econometrics treatments have been implemented.This Phd work shows how stated preference surveys may deal with different complex issues and therefore promote the use of this method. Each of these studies have finally strengthened the conviction that stated preferences constitute an efficient and complete tool."
"The aim of this thesis is to highlight and analyze the factors related to the spatial organization of the population and the economic activities which may produce a more sustainable mobility. By considering that the transport system is not sustainable, we measure mobility costs thanks to three indicators which represent the sustainability of household mobility: the annual costs of household urban mobility, the annual effort rate devoted by households to their transportation expenditures and the annual CO2 emissions. The link between urban form and mobility is not straightforward. Actually, it is a complex reciprocal link to be defined. The literature shows that three dimensions of local environment finally influence household mobility:  density, diversity and accessibility. The method consists on confronting the factors alleged to explain the indicators of the sustainability of household mobility and on determining which part is explained by urban form. On the enlarged perimeter of the household travel survey of Lyon (2006), our approach based on household mobility costs enables, moreover, an approach to financial inequalities and introducing the notion of household vulnerability facing their transportation costs. In order to determine the share of mobility costs explained by urban form, we build some explanatory models, at the household level, by integrating urban form and socio-economic household variables. Especially the analysis focuses on the influence of secondary urban poles on the household vulnerability and mobility costs. Some explanatory models by household types show also that the effects of urban form are differentiated according to household categories. It is also interesting to measure the savings generated by marginal changes of urban form. To do that, we build some econometric models in a more aggregated level which allows computing elasticity coefficients. Thus, we can estimate, in economic terms, the expected savings that are triggered by urban form changes."
"The context of freight transport in transit through the Alps is marked by several decades of traffic flow growth. Such a growth has been uneven over time and from passage to passage. A second element characterises this context. It deals with the peculiar fragility of the alpine areas to traffic impacts: the rising of environmental concerns in these regions appears to be stronger than elsewhere. The aim of this thesis is to comprehend the elaboration of transportation public policies concerning the transalpine traffics. Firstly, we endeavour to assess to which extent this decision making process has contributed towards the emergence of a geopolitical alpine space. Secondly, we seek to clarify the role of economical tools inside this process. The issue will be addressed at two different scales, on the basis of two case studies: the history of the Lyon-Turin project, aiming at retracing the evolution of the strategic goals it has integrated over time; the analysis of the alpine cooperation systems dealing with transports issues developed at the whole alpine arc scale. Outcomes show a progressive “alpinisation” of the transit question. Firstly, it results of a representation of the Alps as a system of interconnected passages. Secondly, it relies on the construction of some structures of cooperation bringing together actors involved by transalpine transit. Another group of outcomes shows that the economical assessment tools and their usage are closely linked to this “alpinisation” process. It also highlights an evolution from a deterministic approach, where economical tools mainly play a justification role for some pre-established strategies, to a procedural approach, where they are shared by actors and used in order to simulate different political options and to help so in designing policies."
"In the first part it analyses the effect of employment protection legislation on worker flows, i.e. the rate of worker reallocation, in OECD countries. Findings suggest that the more restrictive the regulation, the smaller is the rate of within-industry job-to-job transitions, in particular towards permanent jobs. By contrast, it finds no significant effect as regards separations involving an industry change or leading to non-employment. The extent of reinstatement in the case of unfair dismissal appears to be the most important regulatory determinant.The second part revisits the debate on minimum wages in Europe bringing new evidence on systems without a statutory minimum wage and comparing them with countries with a statutory one. Results show that systems with bargained sectoral-level minima are associated with higher Kaitz indices than systems with statutory floors, but also with more individuals actually paid below prevailing minima. Higher collective bargaining coverage can to some extent reduce this trade-off between high wage floors and non-compliance or non-coverage. The third part brings some evidence on the effect of diversity on firm productivity and wages in Belgium and France. Findings show that educational diversity is beneficial for firm productivity and wages while age diversity is harmful. Gender diversity is found to generate significant gains in high-tech/knowledge-intensive sectors or in family firms, while a negative effect is found in more traditional industries or in non-family firms."
"The promotion of railway modal share has large benefits on the environment by reducing the modal share of road transport, which is responsible for about one-fourth of European CO2 emissions. The aim of this dissertation is to analyse freight transport flows in order to provide operational solutions to increase the modal share of railways transport through a better use of intermodal terminals. In the first part of the dissertation a theoretical survey of freight transport models is provided, in order to show the linkage between freight transport and economic activities. A comprehensive analysis of data sources at European, national and regional levels is also provided. In the second part of the dissertation an application to the case of railway intermodal terminals in France is provided, with some comparisons to other European countries. The scope of the analysis is to estimate the potential demand of combined transport, to assess the productivity of intermodal terminals and to evaluate the socio-economic and financial impact of new investments in terminals, also through new project financing schemes (PPPs). The results show a large potential for railway intermodal transport, especially in connection with maritime ports, and low productivity in existing terminals. As a consequence it’s fundamental to concentrate new investments in a few high potential locations, in order to attract private investments and to provide a better use of public funds. The policy implications of this analysis are multiple: it concerns first the railway companies and the infrastructure managers, which should better plan their investments according to commercial needs. It concerns also governments and regional authorities which should better concentrate public funds on optimal terminal locations."
"This thesis, which fits the general economical issues on the research tools of the network industries regulation, questions the relevancy of the French railways regionalisation. The latter, since the reform introduced by the law SRU associates the maintenance of the railway service operating monopoly for the Regional Express Transport (TER) with the decentralisation to the regions, so that they benefit from a prerogative ensured hitherto in a centralised and bureaucratic way. In this institutional environment, original compared to the European movement, have the French regions managed to write and to govern the ""SNCF-TER system” ?To answer both questions, the author used the neo-institutional theory from which he offers an interpretative array on the economical structure of the TER conventions and presents a transposition of this method on surplus accounts to study the economical performance of these contracts.From a panel of seven regions which have tested the regionalisation, the results can only partially confirm the usual deductions made from the standard theory of the monopoly and the capture of the regulator by the regulated firm.  If the contracting SNCF/Regions, far from the “net cost” model, expresses that the legislature accepts a broad industrial and commercial insurance cover, and more on investments made by the community, then regionalisation resulted in a larger variety of employment contracts.A detailed analysis shows the hybrid character of the governance methods which the author calls “fiduciaro-authoritarian”. The method on surplus accounts reveals that, while the effect of monopoly is present and essential to the regions, then it means little benefit to the railway operator but much to RFF. Today travellers have trendily become the “winners’ of the rail regionalisation."
"The failure of structural flood control to mitigate economic losses has lead to a shift towards new policies: floodplain restoration and vulnerability reduction. The economic appraisal of these policies requires an in-depth evaluation of agricultural damage as they are key indicators to determine the efficiency of these policies. However, existing methods only consider harvest loss. We consider that farm vulnerability depends on sensitivity and ability to recover leading respectively to direct damage and induced damage on activity. Based on this, we propose a vulnerability model which allows evaluating the whole of these damages. Three farmer's profiles are defined depending on their ability to access to external resources (workforce and equipment) to recover after flooding. The “Internal” profile has no external resource as opposed to the “Service” and “Solidarity” profiles which can respectively rely on service providing and solidarity. The model is applied to evaluate damages on three farm types of the Rhône River downstream area with a financial and economic valuation. This reveals that damages endured by the profile “Internal” are much higher than those of the two other profiles. Then, avoided damages resulting from the implementation of mitigation measures to reduce vulnerability are evaluated. We prove that these measures are more efficient and can be implemented with Benefit-Cost ratio higher than one, only for the frequently flooded farms. Mitigation measures are also more efficient for the profile “Internal”. To organize solidarity between farms emerges as one of the most interesting measure for all farm types."
"In this dissertation, the reliability of environmental provisions is assessed through a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods to ensure a triangulation of the results. Firstly, the study of their disclosure by the French listed companies reveals its insufficiency and its degradation over the period of 2005-2010. Secondly, both compliance tests to Benford's law and multiple regression analyses do not undermine the reliability of environmental provisions disclosed by the same sample of French listed companies. These results contrast with previous research validating the use of discretionary environmental provisions to smooth earnings and to limit the emergence of political costs. Thirdly, the multiple case study conducted through semi-structured interviews with actors of these groups explains the reliability of environmental provisions by the one from their assessment process and the important institutional pressure that surrounds it. Therefore, the results of this dissertation suggest that some accounting choices that can discretionary affect earnings are better explained by institutional pressure than by the willingness of managers to improve their personal situations."
"The governance of French universities has been profoundly transformed in recent years by developments that have affected the entire public sector, leading to a real drive to achieve an enhanced public performance. The development of a management culture has led French universities to develop control systems to meet the new challenges resulting from these changes. Existing systems can meet the demands of regulatory authorities, but they are not sufficient to help in the strategic piloting. This is due to ambiguous objectives, resulting from the numerous missions of the universities and the similarly numerous stakeholders which should be taken into account. Thus the control systems in place are insufficient for the measurement and control of overall performance. This research shows that if the political will is strong in university, a methodological approach decoupling performance dimensions and based on the expectations of stakeholders allows clarification of the objectives. The implementation of management control systems is also made possible providing universities with the means to control their activities and evaluate their overall performance. Taking the example of the mission of the university in terms of sustainable development, an exploratory approach using multiple case study and action research contributes to the development of a management control system finalized by a Sustainability Balanced Scorecard."
"My thesis concern is about knowledge and in depth-understanding of the annual distribution of individual mobility in France (distinguishing daily, weekend and long distance trips) according to the residential locations (by category of urban areas) via the development of an annual CO2 emissions assessment, to address the issue of climate change. After a brief methodological description of the tool, using the dataset of the most recent French National Transport Survey (2007-2008), the paper presents some typical results, declining the distribution of CO2 emissions due to this mobility according to the zone of residence: beyond the initial descriptive analyses, a cluster analysis of mobility behavior results in four profiles of mobility according to the CO2-emissions budgets on these three time segments of mobility. It shows that each type of mobility behavior is not available (nor uniform) in only one type of space. A ""cocooning effect"" can be detected but it is probably not strong enough to confirm that the citizens of (large) city centers during the weekend necessarily ruin their rather virtuous behavior on week days through the use of less polluting modes. Case studies by gender, frequent travelers (pendulous or transcontinental), and some travel purposes (e.g. shopping, leisure) provide additional results. Finally, the analysis of occupancy rates of the car for local travel shows, that more passengers in a vehicle is an important factor for its energy efficiency (and therefore CO2) due to mobility."
"The aim of my thesis is to study  mathematically an indicator  widely used by the practitioners in the trading market, and designed to detect  changes in the volatility term . The Bollinger Bands indicator belongs to the family of  methods known as technical analysis which consist in looking t the past price movement in order  to predict  its future price movements independently of any mathematical model.  We study the performance of this indicator in a universe that is governed by a stochastic differential equations (Black-Scholes) such that the volatility changes at  an unknown and unobservable random time, for a practitioner seeking to maximize an objective function (for instance, the expected utility of the wealth at a certain maturity). Within the framework of the model, Bollinger indicator can be  interpreted as an estimator of the time at which the volatility changes its value. We show that in the case of small volatilities,  the density behavior of the indicator depends on the value of the volatility, which allows that for large ratio of volatility, to detect via the distribution estimation in which regime of volatility we are. Also , for the case of large volatilities, we show by an approach via the Laplace transform that the asymptotic tails behavior of the indictor  depends on the volatility value. This allows to detect  a change for large volatilities.  Next, we compare two indicators designed to detect a volatility change: the Bollinger bands and the quadratic variation indicators.  Finally, we study the optimal portfolio allocation which is described by a non-standard stochastic problem in view of that the admissible controls need to be adapted to the filtration generated by the prices. We resolve this control problem by an approach used by Pham and Jiao to separate the initial allocation problem into an allocation problem after the rupture and an problem before the rupture, and each one of these problems is resolved by the dynamic programming method. Also, a verification theorem is proved for this stochastic control problem."
"The aim of this thesis is to analyze consultants' practices in psychosocial risks (PSR) management. Phenomenon at the heart of news but without consensual definition, PSR have both approaches: a restrictive one individualizes the risk, limits employer's responsibility and promotes individual care; a broader one considers the organizational dimension of the risk, extends employer's responsibility and promotes work and organization care. This is a strategic field around risk responsibility allocation, putting employers against union representatives.We conducted an exploratory qualitative study at the pragmatic interpretativist paradigm, using a consultant sample (n=37). We showed the consultants' practices heterogeneity around customer/sponsor, specialization, context and PSR management characteristics. Three “practices-type” exist: co-constructives, adaptatives and activists practices. Consultants are hybrids actors from the perspective of competitive market logic: their practices fluctuate between co-constructives and adaptatives practices, even activists ones. We also performed a second field work highlighted one limit of consultants' practices: the “strategic re-appropriation”of recommandations by employer."
"It has been widely recognized that poor health is an important cause of poverty, especiallyamong the low- and middle- income countries. One of the reasons is the absence of publicfinancial protection against the medical consumption risk in these countries. This Phd dissertationis dedicated to discern the role that health insurance could play in the organization of healthfinancial protection system. The dissertation is composed of two parts. The first part discusses theproblems linking to the financing to medical consumption from a global point of view. Chapter 1brings theoretical discussions on three topics: 1) the specialties of medical consumption risks andthe difficulties in using private health insurance to manage medical consumption risks. 2) Therole of government and market in the distribution of health resources. 3) The options for theorganization of health financing system. Chapter 2 conducts a statistical comparison on theperformance of health financing systems in the countries of different social-Economic background.The discussion is carried out around three aspects of health financing: the availability of resources,the organization of health financing, and the coverage of financial protection. The second part ofthe dissertation studies the evolution of heath financing system in a specific country: China. Threechapters are assigned to this part. Chapter 3 introduces the history of Chinese health financingsystem since 1950s. It helps us to understand the challenges in health financing brought byeconomic reform. Chapter 4 carries out an empirical study on the distribution of health financingburden in China in the 1990s. It illustrates the direct results of the decline of public financing andincrease of direct payment. Chapter 5 presents health insurance reform that launched by thegovernment since the end of 1990s. An impact analysis is conducted on an original dataset of 24township hospitals in Weifang prefecture in the north of the China. The objective is to estimatethe impact of the implementation of New Rural Medical Cooperation System (NRMCS) on theactivities and financial structure of township hospitals. At last, we conclude that social healthinsurance (SHI) permits a sharing of health financial responsibilities between the service provider,the patient-Consumer, and the service purchaser. It can not only involve both public and privateagents into the collection of funds for health financing system, but also make each party moreaccountable due to the risks they bear from the result of medical consumption. Meanwhile it isnecessary to note that SHI is just one option among others to organize health financing system.The implementation of SHI requires a certain level of social-Economic development. SHI does notsystematically bring better performance on health financing if it is not accompanied by thereforms on provider payment or on service delivery system. Government commitment andinstitutional capacity are also key factors for the good function of the system."
"Our research focuses on cooperation within territorial networks. We wish, in particular, to characterize the cooperation process which is reached between the members of a social network born from the incentive of authorities. To achieve that, we use a qualitative methodology by carrying out a case study at the Pôle Tourisme de Territoire-Carac'Terres, and at the Pôle Services à la Personne, which were both created to be labelled ""Regional Pole for Innovation and Economic Development based on Solidarity"" (PRIDES) by the Regional Council PACA. We use a theoretical frame combining Proximity Science and Actor-Network Theory, in order to analyse these networks. Two levels of results are proposed. The first one is to characterize the development process of cooperation by identifying the predisposing and hampering factors, and by bringing to light the fact that cooperation is the result of the weaving together of four dimensions - the actors, the management tools, the areas, and the meaning - through a translator. The second level lies in the implement of a hybrid theoretical frame, which allows to grasp the dynamics of proximities through a translating process."
"Acknowledging a limited knowledge and use of climate data in development economics, this thesis proposes a new perspective on the use of both macroeconomic and microeconomic climate data. This thesis has a two-Fold objective: to deepen knowledge on climate data through the production of a new global database directly exploitable by economists, and to propose several applications of this database at different economic scales. The first part focuses on the macroeconomic aspect of the climate data. Its aim is to empower researchers with a deeper understanding of global climate data and to increase economic knowledge on the characteristics of climate change. Chapter 1 contains a climate database available monthly over the 1900-2008 period for nearly 200 countries. Based on this initial work, Chapter 2 proposes an original use of the database with the construction of a physical indicator of vulnerability to climate change, a tool which can be used as a basis for the allocation of aid for climate change adaptation. The second part of this thesis is composed of two microeconomic studies whose aim is to analyse the behaviour of agents facing a rainfall shock. In those two chapters, rainfall data is used to compensate for the lack of data on agricultural production. At the household level, Chapter 3 focuses on the implications of an episode of reduced rainfall on the nutritional status of children under five years old. It shows that rural households do not have the capacity to provide for or absorb climate shocks. At the grain market level, Chapter 4 studies the response of prices to a shock front rainfall. It reveals the presence of speculation, especially in small and poorly integrated markets."

"The installation of marine renewable energies is carried out in compliance with French environmental legislation. The mitigation hierarchy is thus applied to achieve an objective of no net loss of biodiversity. This thesis aims at questioning the effectiveness of the mitigation hierarchy and more specifically biodiversity offsetting as an internalization instrument to halt the erosion of marine biodiversity. We use a qualitative empirical approach to (i) identify the ecological and societal factors as well as their theoretical characteristics that are supposed to enable the offsets achieving the objective of no net loss of biodiversity; and (ii) control whether these conditions are verified in practice for the case of offshore wind farms in Europe and France. The analysis highlights the legal, institutional, methodological and societal issues to be addressed in order to enable biodiversity offsetting to achieve the no net loss priority. On the basis of this observation, a multi-criteria assessment is carried out to reinforce the avoidance and reduction steps of the mitigation hierarchy in order to better define offsetting needs. Ultimately, the analysis shows a shift in biodiversity offsetting based on a strict ecological equivalence to a biodiversity offsetting based on a released ecological equivalence. Offsetting actions tend to be more generalist and / or more directed to ecosystem services than to ecosystem components.

"This thesis investigates the choice of exchange rate regimes in specific economic contexts. The first part of this work (Chapters 1 and 2) considers the case of small open economies with foreign-currency denominated debt and that of a region where there is a similarity among trade-weighted currency baskets of countries. The second part of the thesis (Chapters 3 and 4) focuses on the study of exchange rate regimes and monetary integration in a liquidity trap environment relative to “tranquil” times. Based on dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models and Bayesian and Panel data econometrics, the thesis mainly uses the analyses of impulse responses, welfare and currency misalignments as comparison criteria among alternative currency regimes.The key lessons from this work are summarized as follows. For small open economies heavily in debted in foreign currency, like those of Southeast Asia, the flexible exchange is the best regime, followed by intermediate and fixed exchange rate regimes. At the regional level, it is shown that the exchange rate targeting regime leads to a stability of intra-regional bilateral exchange rates, which is a sort of fixity of exchange rates similar to a “de facto currency area”. In the context of a liquidity trap, we find that, contrary to common belief during the Euro area crisis, the currency union welfare dominates the independent floating regime. Only a central bank intervention in the form of a managed float policy could allow the independent floating to outperform the monetary union.Through both the empirical and theoretical analyses of the liquidity trap effects on currency misalignments, it is shown that the ZLB constraint tends to reduce currency misalignments compared with the independent floating policy. This suggests a reinforcement of the monetary integration within a monetary union during the liquidity trap"

"In a context where both academic institutions and government consider academic excellence as crucial, this thesis aims at contributing to the study of the determinants of scientific productivity of professors. Using an original database of French academic economists involved in the “Prime d’Excellence Scientifique” tournament, the four proposed contributions show the importance of considering two dimensions often ignored so far: first, collective externalities, and the multidimensional nature of professors’ activities.The first chapter investigates the determinants of success in a large competition among French academic economists, the “Prime d’Excellence Scientifique (PES)”. We are particularly interested in the dynamic aspects of this repeated tournament initiated by the French academic system in 2009 to select the best productive researchers for promotion. The econometric estimation of the transition probabilities using sequential-response models allows for identification of changes in weightings assigned to each criterion. Our results confirm the importance of peer-reviewed publications and identify discouraging factors in this dynamic tournament. We also find that past success influences the promotion of professors.The second chapter focuses on the most decisive factor in the award of the “Prime d’Excellence Scientifique”: the scientific production. It shows that the scientific environment can explain both the path dependency in individual scientific productivity and the high inequality and skewness of individual productivity distributions. The results of quantile regressions show the existence of two separated regimes of scientific production, namely the regime of specialists and the regime of generalists. Our results also show that life-cycle effects are not only significant for the evaluation of individual productivity scores but also for the stock of knowledge accumulated in economics departments.Taking into account the potential interactions between teaching and research activities highlighted in the second chapter, the third chapter investigates the determinants of scientific production, including collective determinants related to the research environment, in the context of multitasking teachers. The chapter develops a principal-agent model to understand how university professors allocate their time between two substitutable tasks: publishing and teaching. The theoretical model predicts that professors devote more time to the tasks for which they have a marginal advantage. Controling for endogeneity activity choices, the econometric analysis confirm the key predictions ofthe model: these tasks are conflicting and the institutional context affects the activity choices of professors.Based on the heterogeneity of publication outlets, the fourth chapter analyzes the determinants of the quantity-quality tradeoff in scientific production. The focus is on the determinants of two types of publications identified by the journals ranking in Economics of the French National Committee for Scientific Research (CNRS): publications in high-quality journals and publications in low quality journals. The joint estimates of these two types of publications indicate that there is a tradeoff between the high quality publications and low quality publications, and this tradeoff is imputable to the scientific environment of professors. Our results confirm a negative impact of teaching and administrative duties on the publications in high quality journals."
"User conflicts and resistance behaviours represent one of the major managerial difficulties during Information Systems (IS) implementation. Although numerous IS studies tackle user resistance and conflicts by anticipating, minimising or even amplifying these negative behaviours, little research has taken into consideration the contagion mechanisms of conflicts and examined why and how users similarly resist to entirely different Information Technology (IT) projects. The IS literature is sparse on addressing the impact of resistance behaviours that occurred in the past on the new IT. IS managers need to anticipate potential causes for project failure because of ongoing resistance behaviours toward the new IT, but also because of resistance behaviours occurred in the past and persist until today, or are likely to reappear. For IS researchers and practitioners, my research gives greater attention to issues related to current and prior conflicts occurring in a firm’s IT project portfolio. Therefore, we particularly mobilise the theories of contagion and Inoculation which have been so far weakly used in the field of information systems. The empirical part consists of a three-year action research project conducted at Efficient Innovation Corporation (a French management consulting firm). Firstly, my observations reveal that employees expressing task-oriented conflicts towards an IT deployment project were likely to use a bypassing strategy, hiding socio-political conflicts. Secondly, we were able to identify a phenomenon of conflict contagion between two IT projects despite their strong differences in terms of objectives, functional perimeters and users. Thirdly, the ""Inoculation"" techniques that we implemented succeeded to stall and limit the diffusion of resistance behaviours toward IT. The underlying message of this thesis is to consider prior resistance behaviours and conflict contagion as key processes integrated into IT implementation. Accordingly, we introduce the concept of ""Resistance Path Dependency"", and propose a conceptual model of possible conflict contagion mechanisms between different teams and IT projects."
"There is still much progress to make concerning the French and the European railway networks, both from governance and competitiveness standpoints. This is the conclusion this work lead to. The results from the Enerdata-LET research consortium (2014) illustrate that, considering factor 4 for horizon 2050, the modal shift of demand in transport towards railway could be massive. Regarding this, the situation of Paris-Lyon high-speed line, already up to its saturation level, addresses the issue of the capacity a system possesses to bear new traffics. Two schools oppose there. On one side, the supporters of the SNIT suggest a quasi-doubling of the high-speed railway network, in order to cope with futures needs, whereas on the other side, the “Mobilité 21” commission gives priority to the search of increasing returns from the existing infrastructure. Without claiming to solve the issue, this work attempts to bring up comprehension elements on the interaction between demand and offer in the railway sector.Studying the accordance between an increase in railway demand and offer leads us to question performance. It means being able to define capacity of the railway infrastructure, first. But it also means questioning its limits, which addresses the phenomenon of saturation, also called congestion. Eventually, this all inevitably leads to put into perspective the relativeness of these limits and to question the ways to overcome them. The objective of this research is to apply this issue to the railway system, accounting its specificities. We consider its constitution as a network industry and as a natural monopoly, when considering the infrastructure (infrastructure manager). Without pretending to conclude the debate on governance, we consider that this particularity might influence actors and, thus, performance. We also consider the legal framework at the European scale. One can’t question performance without framing the railway sector within its legal context. Then, the main purpose of the analysis stands in the study of saturation of the Paris-Lyon high-speed line. We consider the line as representative of the expected performance level of the whole French railway network. It challenges both technical and economic capacities that are in the core of our rationale on performance, its requirements and the opportunities of the French network."
"The price dispersion and the variety of products on the wine market has attracted an increasing interest from the economists community. On the other end, the agents of this market require new economic tools to understand the recent evolutions, such as the multiplication of influential experts and the accelerating integration of the wine regions in the global economy. This dissertation aligns the interests of economists and wine professionals by developing new methods for the study and the impact measurement of wine prices determinants. Each of the four chapters constituting this thesis introduces a specific methodological innovation and illustrates its benefits with an empirical application using novel data on the Bordeaux wine market. The first chapter builds on weather data to identify the subjective component of tasting grades and assess the influence of experts on retail prices. The second chapter proposes a scaling method to compare quality scores among different sources. The third chapter estimates the causal impact of the obtention of a medal at wine competitions on the prices paid to producers. The fourth and last chapter assembles a comprehensive database on macro-level determinants of the fluctuations of the Bordeaux wine market to build an operational forecasting model of the average prices by protected appellation of origin."
"The knowledge-based economy forces SMEs to form strategic alliances or merge with other similar or business companies in order to compete in the world markets. In the meantime, the concept of the industry cluster was widely implemented in many developing and developed countries for improving the competitiveness of their industries. Although many clusters have successful to develop their competitiveness, large numbers of them have failed. The study of Ecotec [DTI 05] which focuses on the key success factors of the cluster development stated that the two factors of the cluster development are collaboration and knowledge sharing among the cluster members. Thus, the principle of this study is to enhance the cluster by adopting the notion of the knowledge management which focuses on creation, representation, sharing, and reusing the knowledge. Therefore, Knowledge Management System (KMS) architecture for the cluster is proposed in this study in order to support these processes. We propose a “Model Suite” for analyzing and designing the KMS which comprises four levels:Firstly, the context level focuses on the cluster organizational analysis, which will present a global view of the actors, knowledge assets, and knowledge-intensive tasks of the specific cluster. Secondly, the concept level focuses on the knowledge itself by modeling the experts’ knowledge into the explicit form. Moreover, it also examines the collaboration model of the cluster. Thirdly, the design level aims at extracting cluster’s requirements into the system specification in order to be transferred to the implementation level. In this level, the information system is generated from different technologies for supporting the needs of the cluster organization. The KMS which is an outcome of the Model Suite is applied to a handicraft cluster in Thailand as our case study. It allows cluster members to create, share, and reuse the knowledge via a collaborative knowledge card module which is proposed in our study. The scenarios are presented in order to demonstrate how the KMS improves the collaboration and knowledge sharing among the members. Moreover, we also present the integration of the knowledge and collaboration services of the system in order to facilitate the knowledge users to retrieve the knowledge from the system via mobile device anywhere and anytime."

"This thesis contributes to the analysis of public debt sustainability and fiscal rules. It starts from the multiple empirical evidence that points to the existence of unsustainable fiscal regimes during which fiscal policy does not increase its primary surplus following an increase of public debt. Do unsustainable fiscal regimes necessarily threaten the long-run sustainability of public debt? If not, how long can fiscal policy be periodically unsustainable without being globally unsustainable? The first chapter answers theoretically this question and proposes a Regime-Switching Model­Based Sustainability (RS-MBS) test. We study a Markov-switching fiscal policy rule, which displays an unsustainable fiscal regime, and derive sufficient conditions for the No-Ponzi Game condition and for a globally stable public debt-to-GDP ratio. The second chapter proposes an empirical application of the RS-MBS to France's fiscal policy between 1962 and 2013. It shows that taking into account regime switches can overturn former results and conclude that France's public debt has been sustainable overall the period. The third chapter considers another case of unsustainable regime, when fiscal policy is constrained by the fiscal limit, and studies the effect of public debt maturity on the debt limit. We show that longer debt maturities do not increase the stochastic default threshold when sovereign default is triggered by bad productivity shocks. Finally, the fourth chapter proposes a critical appraisal of the fiscal architecture of the EMU, based on a literature survey about fiscal sustainability, monetary-fiscal interactions and fiscal rules in monetary unions."
"The debate about the contribution of domestic food chains to national food security in developing countries was revived by the last food price crises. In Asia, midstream enterprises implement technical changes and integrate new functions, resulting in increased added value and lower prices for consumers. The general objective of the thesis is to contribute to knowledge about the organization of domestic food value chains in Africa and their economic and social implications for small-scale farmers. It addresses three issues. First, it analyzes the organization of the rice value chain in Senegal to determine if it follows the same modernization pattern as the Asian one. Second, the thesis examines the inclusion of small-scale producers in contract farming, with a specific focus on the combination of marketing modes. Third, the thesis assesses the impacts of contracts on small-scale farmer incomes and food security. The theoretical framework is the governance of the Global Value Chain, which analyzes the influence of the driver of the quality on the distribution of tasks and skills among the actors of the chain. It is combined with the theoretical frameworks of plural forms and livelihoods to address the second issue. The case studied is the Senegal River Valley rice value chain. Data analyses are based on 154 qualitative interviews and a body of quantitative data involving over 913 actors in the value chain. Producer participation in contracts is analyzed with a multimodal logit model and the selection bias is corrected with instrumental variable and propensity score models. The first result is that modernization of the Senegalese value chain is in step with what is taking place in Asia. Nevertheless, in Senegal, (1) the benchmark situation is a spot transaction (and not a tied output-credit transaction), and processors carried out paddy collection before the modernization, (2) credit policies directly contribute to the change in governance, and (3) the modernization of the rice value chain does not make it competitive relative to imports of broken rice. The second result is that small-scale producers participate in contracts to secure agricultural financing. The segmentation of the credit market is linked to the indebtedness of small-scale producers to the national agriculture bank. Uncertainty is a second order driver towards plural forms. Besides, producers continue marketing through spot transactions which can be adapted to household needs. The third result is that the impacts of contracts on small-scale farmers are different. The marketing contract is a financial device which has no impact on agricultural practices, yields, product quality and income. It nevertheless slightly improves food security by mitigating price seasonality. The production contract has a positive impact on the income of producers who were excluded from bank credit. It nevertheless includes implicit interest and insurance costs, meaning that these producers make less profit than those financed by the bank. In order to support the modernization, policies should enhance the design of an appropriate insurance system for agricultural credit. They should also include small-scale processors in the modernization through the promotion of semi-industrial technics and the opening up of operating and equipment loans. Finally, they should fund studies about the use of small-scale mechanization."
"Despite their usefulness, few researches in social marketing have been conducted in the environmentaldomain (McKenzie-Mohr et al., 2011). This research proposes to focus on the persuasion of environmental associations promoting the adoption of pro-environmental behaviors on the littoral. A qualitative study carried out among 17 actors in coastal protection shows that the different elements of the social marketing mix are deployed by these actors with a predominance of communication in the case of associations. As the literature highlights the low level of involvement in environmental issues in recreational and tourism contexts, the second study focuses on communication heuristics. Thus, through a quantitative study of 1360 individuals, we analyze the effect of two communication heuristics: the nonprofit brand as the source of the message and the social norms within the message through a modeling of their effects on three pro- environmental behaviors (Garbage collection, petition signing, donation). The results model the antecedents of attachment to the nonprofit brand and show its significant positive effect on the adoption of pro-environmental behaviors. However, social norms do not moderate this relationship. This research contributes to the literature on social marketing highlighting the effects of nonprofit brand attachment to the adoption of behavior promoted by the association. It also contributes to the literature on pro- environmental behavior by studying these behavior in a less studied context, the recreational context. From a managerial standpoint, it offers a way to guide future communication campaigns of environmental associations and invites them to work on their branding strategy to accentuate the effects of thesecampaigns."
"This thesis contributes to the literature in urban economics on neighborhood effects by answering three questions : What is the importance of territory in unemployment-to-work transitions ? Are there neighborhood effects in France ? How to explainunemployment geography ? Answering to these questions requires an approach in several steps. Firstly, the importance of the territory is analyzed by a literature review that lists the different mechanisms by which the local context can affect individuals’ access to employment. We also propose a descriptive analysis of unemployment disparities between municipalities in France and especially in the Paris region. The strong contrasts, which are maintained even when one considers the composition of local job-seekers, show the relative importance of the territory. Then, the thesis proposes empirical analysis on individual data to demonstrate the existence of neighborhood effects in France. We show that the ""quality"" of the neighborhood and its characteristics determine individuals’ employment status. Individuals who live in deprived neighborhoods are less likely than others to find a job and when they find it, it is generally of lower quality. Among the observed neighborhoods effects, we seek to highlight the existence of territorial discrimination. We propose different but complementary methodologies to analyze the effect of the reputation of a neighborhood. We observe that it decreases the chances of finding employment. Finally, in order to explain unemployment geography, the thesis proposes some analysisformunicipalities in Paris region. The objective is to test different mechanisms discussed in the literature in urban economics (residential segregation, Spatial Mismatch, emphSkill Mismatch etc.) to see which are most relevant and which should be considered a priority. Identify the mechanisms involved is a necessary and an important step to guide public policies that want to improve the situation of deprived neighborhoods."
"This dissertation  evolves around the following three general thematic: uncertainty, utility and no-arbitrage.In the first chapter we establish the existence of an optimal portfolio for investor trading in a multi-period and discrete-time financial market without uncertainty and maximising its terminal wealth expected utility. We consider general non-concave and non-smooth random utility function defined on the half real-line. The proof is based on dynamic programming and measure theory tools.In the next three chapters, we introduce the concept of Knightian uncertainty and adopt the multi-prior non dominated and discrete time framework introduced in [25]..In this setting, in the second chapter we study the notion of quasi-sure no-arbitrage introduced in [25] and propose two equivalent definitions: a quantitative and geometric characterisation. We also introduce a stronger no-arbitrage condition that simplifies some of the measurability difficulties.In the third chapter, we build on the results obtained in the previous chapter to study the maximisation of multiple-priors non-dominated worst-case expected utility for investors trading in a multi-period and discrete-time financial for general concave utility functions defined on the half-real line unbounded from above. The proof uses again a dynamic programming framework together with measurable selection.Finally the last chapter formulates a utility indifference pricing model for investor trading in a multi-period and discrete-time financial market.  We prove that under suitable condition the multiples-priors utility indifference prices of a contingent claim converge to its multiple-priors superreplication price"
"Wine tourism has been a growing issue in vineyards since the last twenty years. Benefits are expected from its development for both wines sales and local economic development. However, wine tourism development is neither systematic nor uniform in vineyards. This observation leads the thesis to question the diversity of wine tourism and to develop its understanding. The main hypothesis is about the existence of a link between wine tourism diversity and wine industry diversity. Using an analysis based on regional economics, services economics and institutional theories of the firm, the thesis explains how local wine industry attributes influence local wine tourism. It highlights that the strategies of wine professionals play a key role in that influence – because they are simultaneously the central actors in the wine industry and in wine tourism. The application of the analytical framework to the champagne case confirms the hypothesis: the specific organization of the champagne industry and the particular geography of its vineyard affect the wine tourism strategies (individual and collective) of champagne professionals. It consequently gives local wine tourism a specific shape."
"The technical management of risks in Francophone Sub-Saharan Africa is often lacking in practice. In fact, in this zone, it is very easy to meet banks, insurance companies and pension institutions, doing their activities without integrating risk at the core of their management. This situation explains, a priori, the absence of reliable databases for quantitative studies.  This thesis, which is complementary to work of KAMEGA A., focuses on the design of relevant actuarial tools adapted to technical risk management in sub-Saharan Africa, which can be used by both the governments of this zone and the insurance and banks industry.  In view of the gradual development of the countries in the CIPRES zone, we believe that the economic scenario generator (ESG) is the common tool for the technical management of risks linked to the activities of the states and the banking and insurance industry. Note that the GSE is a tool able to forecast the economic and financial variables into a coherent system. This rich information will allow, for example, the governments of these countries to draw up their budgets mobilize resources on the local financial market and manage technically the public debt. In the context of the design of the GSE, the contribution of this thesis consists to specify initially mathematical models, adapted to the context of the CIPRES zone, covering a large number of economic and financial variables. In a second step, calibration methods are presented in the context of lack of data (expert opinion) or presence of data (statistical approaches). Particular attention is given to the extension of the GSE in order to take into account the future needs of professionals of the CIPRES zone. This thesis also gives importance to the application of the GSE in the development of the countries of the CIPRES zone through the contribution of the yield curve in the analysis and conduct of monetary policy, the forecasting of economic and financial quantities, Estimation of the probabilities of implicit defaults and the recovery rates of states and firms in the context of a local currency rating and the application of the Basel II / III framework in the course of 2018. Under the pension plans, these actuarial tools are useful in determining of the management parameters of the plan, including the ""best estimate"" of plan commitments, funding and asset allocation strategy"
This thesis focuses on the influence of green NGOs. It studies situations where theses organisations interact with other actors and try to change their behavior. The first chapter looks at the competition between several NGOs in order to get the attention both the population and the governement. The second chapter studies the relation between the NGO activities and their media coverage. It focuses on the media market forces which lead to differences in coverage of NGO activities. The third chapter focuses on activits mobilization against a public project with environmental externalities
"The main objective of this thesis is to estimate the volatility of high-frequency financial data by the Score-GARCH model in the context of the recent financial crisis (2007-2008). The actual contribution of our thesis covers three major axes. First, we have highlighted the stylized facts observed empirically in high-frequency financial data, in the case of four CAC40 financial assets. This study allowed us to analyze the dynamics and asymmetry of the returns of high-frequency financial assets. Second, given the stylized facts in relation to the behavior of volatility, we have modeled the volatility of high-frequency financial assets by the Score-GARCH model, and compared it with the classic asymmetric GARCH models (reference models ). The third axis proposes intraday market risk measures (VaR) in the particular context of high frequency data regularly spaced over time (every five minutes)."
"This thesis examines the impact of socially responsible investment on the risk and performance of portfolios. It is based on four studies, including three empirical studies.The first study proposes an inventory and a critical analysis of the portfolios' CSR risks. It indicates that CSR risks assessed in different ways by the actors still exist within the portfolios and evolve with the institutional context. Their level may be low or high depending on the CSR practices of the companies in which the resources are invested. The second study deals with the comparative analysis of the financial risk of SRI funds and conventional funds. On a sample of funds distributed in France over the period 2002-2012, our results show that SRI funds may have a higher level of diversification than matched conventional matched regardless of market conditions. These are SRI funds invested in the Eurozone and globally. However, regardless of market conditions, SRI funds invested in the Eurozone, Europe and France have a greater systematic risk than their traditional counterparts, contrary to SRI global funds. The third study analyzes the financial risk of portfolios built according to companies’ level of ESG performance over the period 2002-2014. These portfolios cover the Eurozone and the U.S. firms. Our analysis shows that the U.S. portfolios which over-perform on the aggregate ESG criteria or individually on the three ESG criteria have a lower financial risk than those that underperform on these dimensions. For the same types of portfolios, the Eurozone exhibit a lower specific risk. The results on the systematic risk are influenced by the industry-specific effects for the U.S. portfolios and the country-specific effects for the Eurozone portfolios. The fourth study examines the financial performance persistence of SRI and conventional funds. It shows through non-parametric tests that there is no performance persistence for both SRI and conventional funds."
"This thesis focus on cooperatives survival. Since the financial crisis, the cooperative model is particularly promoted for its ability to resist crises. However, this resilience seems to be inferred from many economic facts (growth in cumulative cooperative sector turnover, increase in membership and wage employment, etc.) and not scientific studies. Thus, the aim of this research is to provide scientific insight into the ability of the cooperative model to cope better than corporations. Cooperatives are held by their members who have the dual status of suppliers of capital and suppliers, employees or customers. From this singular ownership flows an ambition that goes beyond the dominant financial paradigm of maximizing value for capital providers: maximizing value for members. Hence, one question arises: does ownership of cooperatives affect their ability to cope better? To answer this question, we have structured our thinking around four essays. The first essay is a literature review that revisits the notion of cooperative performance: in the case of cooperatives, financial performance can be equated with the ability to resist over time, that is, to survive. In the second essay we compare the survival of cooperatives and corporations, by distinguishing between disappearances by mergers and liquidations, and test the influence of classical financial determinants. The results indicate that cooperatives seem to be more resilient through a particular mechanism: the merger. This allows a redeployment of the activity and members can continue to sell their production in an organization that they will collectively hold and that they will manage democratically. Thus, while mergers are not the property of cooperatives, they reflect the principle of solidarity between cooperatives and make it possible for members to avoid the negative consequences of the disappearance of the activity. The results also indicate that the traditional financial determinants do not fully account for the survival of cooperatives. The third essay focuses on longevity. We observe that cooperatives survive longer than corporations. Moreover, this article, voluntarily dealing with a precise and homogeneous sector, propose an explanation for the best survival of cooperatives: it seems that they reflect the fluctuations of activity on their members. The fourth and final essay of the thesis focuses exclusively on cooperatives in order to propose a specific financial analysis and special financial ratios to explain their survival. The results indicate that the determinants of disappearance by mergers and liquidations are different, and confirm the role of mergers as a mechanism of survival. Moreover, contrary to the flagship that cooperatives absorb shocks thanks to their common equity, it seems that the ones which cope better are those whose members agree to bear the risk through their remuneration."

"This doctoral thesis studies the New Rural Reconstruction (NRR) movement from a sustainable development perspective, through a concrete case of Sancha village, a rural community in China's Guangxi province. Initiated in 2003, the NRR is a grassroots network of development projects which unites intellectuals, students and organizations to experiment with different models of agricultural and rural development in China. As an alternative to agricultural industrialization, the NRR favors the cooperation of smallholder farmers, local knowledge and agro-ecology for sustainable agricultural development. In order to understand the NRR's institutional characteristics, functioning and impact, we conducted a survey in Sancha village to collect data on smallholder farmers' socio-economic behavior and performed three in-depth NRR case studies. Our empirical analysis suggests that the NRR has promoted the development of organic farming in the village. Social activities are cost-effective for social network building where organic farming is diffused rapidly. Nevertheless, without sufficient, ongoing technical training, farmers newly converted to organic farming tend to overuse nitrogen and lose their environmental advantage in rice production. To improve the performance of smallholder farmers, participatory social learning appears useful but limited because smallholder farmers are interested in economic performance rather than environmental protection. On basis of these results, we recommend a state-civil society partnership which combines the government's agricultural extension services and bottom-up rural reconstruction for the commonobjective of sustainable agriculture in China."
"The Mass-market retailing logistics relies on an organization multi-actor whose principles of flexibility and adaptability to the lesser cost are the levers of a performance based on the substitutability of the logistics service providers (LSP). This organization leads to a strategic dependence of PSL with respect to the large distribution. However, some providers incorporate a sustainable development approach. The problematic of the thesis is as follows: Why and how logistics providers incorporate, voluntarily, a sustainable development policy within the outbound logistics chain of the Mass-market Retail? The theoretical framework is first based on the model ""Plug and Play"". It allows characterizing the logistics of the Mass-market Retailing by asset specificity and contract approach. It is complemented by the theory of decoupling and embeddedness, according to White, which helps to explain the blocking attribute of the ""Plug and Play"" model and possible action of LSP. The methodology chosen is an abductive exploratory approach in a moderate constructivist position. It relies on an in-depth case study of an outbound logistics of a Mass-market Retailing and its LSP. A triangulation of methods essentially mobilizes a qualitative approach through interviews, but also a quantitative survey. The results of the research show, in the case studied, that the LSP are embedded in logistics 'Plug and Play' of the trade, and on which they are dependents. In response, some providers attempt to decouple themselves from the 'Plug and Play', by integrating a sustainable development policy and embedded themselves in a model of “Plug and Play” where the power relations between LSP and the trade is balanced."
"This thesis, consisting of four articles, deals with the dynamics of the diﬀusion of knowledge among the internal stakeholders of a French competitiveness cluster through multi-agent modeling. The ﬁrst three articles are a set of theoretical reﬂections on inter-organizational knowledge sharing and, as an extension of this, the fourth article includes the speciﬁcs of a cluster. Article number 1 provides a dynamic extension of the impact of the absorptive capacity of Sakakibara (2003) and Egbetokun and Savin (2012) on the stock of knowledge of partner companies. Article number 2 focuses on players who try to minimize the deﬁcit caused by a misperception of interactions of two projects in which they invest regularly. It analyzes a large number of decision makers sharing information with their closest neighbors. Article number 3 carries out an extension of the model of article number 1 based on article number 2, incorporating misperception of information exchanged between stakeholders and examines its impact on the accumulation of knowledge. The last article transposes the previous model by incorporating the notion of trust and certain speciﬁcities of French competitiveness clusters."
"The aim of this study was to improve the quality of dried tomato by the use of microwaves combined to hot air (MOAC). The main point was to preserve the quality of dried tomato avoiding the appearance of black spots which often occur during microwaves heating which result from local overheating of the product when it becomes dry. Therefore, an MOAC drying system with ability of automatic control of the power density was developed under LabView®. After an initial study where the applied microwave power remained constant during the drying, a second MOAC drying strategy, with two different control modes, was implemented. This modes consisted to adjust the microwave power density to the remaining amount of water (actually the weight of the product). In the fist one, it is adjusted every second, while in the second, the power was adjusted only every 5 min. Therefore the ratio between the power applied and the weight of the product (i.e. the specific power) remained constant. All the process parameters, including the power applied and the product temperature and weight were recorded every second. The final product was characterized by performing measurements on color, texture, structure and residual lycopene content. In our initial study on MOAC drying performed at constant power (i.e. variable specific power), we have obtained dried tomatoes with hot spots and with a residual lycopene content lower than 50%. The tomatoes dried at constant specific power showed a better physical aspect and a higher nutritional quality, even compared to two commercial products from Italy and Ivory Coast. In addition, the structure of dried tomatoes observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) allowed to explain changes in dried tomatoes texture. Chemically, the residual rate of lycopene in tomatoes dried at constant specific power ranged respectively between 64.78 and 55.63% for low power and air temperatures (3W/g-30 °C) and between 31.91 and 28.75% for high power and air temperatures (7W/g-50° C), while only 30.56 and 22.30% for commercial tomatoes from Italy and Ivory Coast."
"Literature has been deeply interested in the solitary entrepreneur, mainly in his origins, profile and actions. Some authors consider him as a myth and a hero capable to exceed himself in the most complex situations. The emergence of new technology companies introduced a new form of entrepreneurship more and more frequent, which comes in the shape of entrepreneurial team. Since there is a reservation on the topic of academic thoughts in this field of study, it is useful to provide some insight on this. This research is intended for a theoretical and practical contribution to the understanding of the entrepreneurial team concept. Following a literary review on entrepreneurial teams, we propose a theoretical framework based on systemic approach. In fact, the entrepreneurial team is a dynamic entity; an analytical analysis seems to reduce the complexity in its elementary components whereas it should be treated in its irreducible globalism."
"The purpose of this thesis is to study how a shared vision can emerge among the members of the entrepreneurial teams managing nonprofit organizations. We first examine the grassroots approach that emphasizes the collective action of volunteers and employees working together in the development of the association. We then consider social entrepreneurship literature focusing on the effective achievement of social goals. We integrate these two visions as two possible forms of entrepreneurship in nonprofit organizations. We identify the entrepreneurial team as a group of individuals working together toward the development of the objectives of the nonprofit organization and their achievement. We analyze how the different members of the team position themselves with regard to these two visions to analyze the risk of divisions, but also the possibility of the emergence of a shared vision. Adopting a socio-psychological approach, we conceptualize the notion of a shared vision in terms of social representations. We integrate the confrontation between these two representations as part of a cycle through which actors adjust their vision to fit reality. We then go on to study and explain how social entrepreneurship practices are introduced and develop within the entrepreneurial team of nonprofit organizations.Based on 48 semi-structured interviews and a full case study, the data collected contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms through which the shared vision emerges and evolves. Our research model highlights the distance between the ideal of the vision and the reality in practice. Between this ideal and the reality, operational and psychological processes are at work. Drawing on Weick (1979), when members of the entrepreneurial team are divided between two visions of their non-profit organization, the “retention” of one or the other is the consequence of managerial “enactment” rather than discussion."
"Every year, rescue operations at sea are increasing. In 2015, there was 5% more rescues than the previous year. Studies reveal that ""caution is not systematic"" and that there is a real “dangerconsciousness deficit"". Usually, they are often referred to ""irresponsible"" behaviours. Despite of many prevention actions over the past several years, the number of accidents continues to grow. Therefore, it seems important to understand and prevent this irresponsibility first, in order to use the responsibility of boaters more efficiently. The concept of irresponsibility and its motivations are poorly understood in management sciences, and especially in marketing. The purpose of this research is to explain irresponsible behaviours of sailors through their motivations. A review of the literature and two empirical studies have been conducted. The first chapter presents the current maritime context as well as a multidisciplinary literature review on irresponsibility. A conceptual framework of irresponsibility is presented in the second chapter, explaning how it leads to a first theoretical model. This model is improved in the third chapter through the qualitative study : a thematic analysis of content of 16 semidirective interviews. The fourth chapter presents the methodology used to test the model. The fifth chapter is about the creation of « the motivations to irresponsible behaviours » scale, and the  validation of the other measuring instruments. The final chapter presents the test of the model and a typological analysis. This research brings a contribution to the literature about the concept of irresponsibility and the measurement of its motivations. This research allows a better understanding of boaters behaviours and suggests some improvements of the maritime prevention campaigns."
"Team entrepreneurship is a reality for many businesses. Research works aim to study this side of management phenomenon. For this contribution we examine the individual expectation for self-employment and describe the effectiveness of the team, in the sense of satisfaction of the members, as an element for the survival of the business. The farm sector gives the opportunity for our discipline to examine this form of entrepreneurship. Farms succession, the size of the enterprises, justifies the development of multi owner organisations. Behavioural psychology and social psychology, help us to analyse the entrepreneur believes. Entrepreneurial initiative in a team context is widely mentioned by students, in a study based on entrepreneurial intention models. Then we ask farmers about the reality of their situation in regards of initial expectations. We challenge the professional organisations analysis to confirm our research.We offer to have a new approach of team entrepreneurship, helping entrepreneurs and consultants toward durability of the project.

"This thesis deals with the economic analysis of population diversity, specifically diversity in terms of people's countries of origin. We propose an index of birth-place diversity for the work force of 195 countries in the years 1990 and 2000. We show that birthplace diversity is a new dimension of population diversity that is conceptually and empirically distinct from ethno-linguistic and genetic measures of diversity and, unlike these, is positively correlated with long-run economic output. This effect is larger for skilled immigrants in richer countries and robust in a SLS setting. We also find the productive effect  of diversity to be larger for immigrants who are culturally close (but not too close) to natives and those who come from richer origin countries. We also investigate the link between birthplace diversity and attitudes to immigration. Using the World Values Survey with data for 72 countries, we find that skilled natives increase their support for immigration when diversity of skilled immigrants is high. results are robust to using the European Social Survey and also persist in a SLS model. We also find evidence for negative preference effects of immigrant diversity for more ethnocentric individuals. Lastly, we analyze the link between birthplace diversity and attitudes to redistribution in Europe. Using data for 29 European countries, we find that native workers tend to lower their support for redistribution of income when immigration is high. In addition, this effect varies along the skill distribution of natives, converges towards zero for highly educated individuals and is robust to using more detailed measures of labor market skill."
"This research takes the literature on management tools (Moisdon et al., 1997 ; Hatchuel et Weil, 1992 ; David, 1996, 1998) as a starting point. I focus on the co-evolution of a management practice in-use (Jarzabkowski, 2004), here Knowledge Management (KM) and an organisation. My research deals with the question « How can we do KM ? ». This refers to the different approaches for managing knowledge as well as to the different reasons that lead an organisation to adopt KM practices and tools. A multi-level analysis, combining the institutional, organisational and inter-individual contexts, is carried out. This framework calls upon various theories: institutionalism, management tools, managerial theories of the multinational corporation, social regulation (Reynaud, 1989), thus broadening our understanding of the dynamics of a management practice in-use within an organisation. The concept of emplotment (Ricoeur, 1983) is used to study the dynamics of KM within the Cement Division of the Lafarge group. The main plot - why KM? - brings forward the strategic context of the cement industry and the organisation of the technical expertise function. This plot is the starting-point for the different stories of KM in the Cement Division, which are told from different perspectives in time and space. The main results of this research show that Knowledge Management is mainly used to increase the firm’s legitimacy both towards external and internal stakeholders. KM is a tool in the hands of strong headquarters that claim to be the ultimate knowledge owner. Thus, I related the switch of KM from a perspective based on personalisation, competencies management and autonomy to a perspective focusing on codification, information management and prescription. Resistance to codification highlights the conflict between KM, set in a control mode (régulation de contrôle) and the employee’s will for autonomy (régulation autonome). The tension between these two types of regulation leads to a crisis as can be seen through the growing sense of unease among the experts. In the end however, such tensions do not interfere with the daily run of operations as KM is decoupled from ongoing activity. Thus, the story of the Cement Division is a case of strategic domination. In the absence of a joint regulation (régulation conjointe), decoupling discourse from practice allows the survival of the organizational model."
"A project is a temporary and unique endeavour undertaken to deliver a result. This result is always a changein the organization, whatever it is in its processes, performance, products or services. Limits and lacks havebeen detected in research as well as in industry about the project predictability, since usual parameters(time, cost and quality) are clearly not sufficient to describe properly the complete situation at a given time.As a whole, current methods have shown their limits, since they cannot face anymore the stakes of evergrowing project complexity, which is an ever growing source of project risks. This Ph.D. thesis aims atthinking project management in the age of complexity and understand how complexity aspects can beintegrated into project management practices, particularly in the case of the project risk managementprocess. After defining concepts, this thesis aims at describing project complexity thanks to the elaborationof a project complexity framework, which is refined thanks to an international Delphi study. This refinedframework is then the basis of an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) hierarchical structure which permits tobuild a relative project complexity index in order to assist decision-making. For all practical purposes, itnotably permits to focus on the most complex projects within a portfolio or on the most complex zones of aproject in order to assist complex project management. Then, after describing the consequences of projectcomplexity and understanding the limits of existing project risk management processes to cope with somecomplexity-related aspects, this Ph.D. thesis proposes two innovative approaches to assist complex projectrisk management. The first one is based on a systems approach through the introduction of the concept ofproject vulnerability. The second one is mainly based on an analytical approach which aims at clusteringproject risks according to the strength of their interactions (in terms of possible cause-consequence link).Diverse industrial case studies permit to test these proposals (automotive, pharmaceutical, entertainmentand construction industries)."
"Contribution to the re-engineering of EFS processes Today businesses operate in a complex and dynamic environment that is constantly changing. Their competitiveness and sustainability depends on their agility and ability to satisfy the requirements of the different stakeholders.The general issue of this work is ""how to ensure a company creates value for its various stakeholders by controlling the risks linked to changes in its activities and environment? ». We propose a dynamic and systemic process redesign method, oriented towards value creation and incorporating the risks linked to the system and its environment: SCOS'R2 (Systemics for Complex Organizational Systems' Reengineering and Risk).This method is based on a four-step approach: identify the sub-systems to redesign by identifying the change and risk factors; model value creation; determine the actions for improvement or reengineering based on the value-creation model and the overall risk management; and, finally, re-design the relevant subsystem.To ensure its long-term survival, the EFS must meet the requirements of various stakeholders and adapt as quickly as possible to changes in the environment and to the risks which may affect its operation.Thus, we applied this method to the EFS that will enable it to cope with its uncertain, complex and changing environment. The purpose of this method is to ensure an optimal level of security and quality, together with continuous improvement of multicriteria performance (quality, security, medical, technical, economical, etc., criteria).The SCOS'R2 method was applied to the EFS subsystems most affected by the change and risk factors, namely to the blood collection system and the sub-system for provision of plasma for the LFB (Laboratoire français du Fractionnement et des Biotechnologies)."
"This research focuses on the concept of « linking value », applied to mutualist insurance companies, in order to contribute to the revival of their core values and democratic ideals. It is fed by the evolutions of contemporary society, where chosen consumption is progressively replacing mass consumerism, thus moderating the producer-consumer dichotomy, which allows new types of relationships between actors to emerge. The progressive disappearance of the borders between consumption actors is key to our work, as the mutualist insurance companies’ stakeholders build new types of relations, beyond classic consumption relations, which yields not only exchange value and use value, but also a linking value. The concept of linking value was originally developed by social science, and further brand community developments have led to mobilize this notion in the marketing field. Its usage in the field of insurance services is new. Our work comprises a survey among members of Groupe Macif, including interviews with Macif employees, Macif delegates, and Macif’s historic founder. Linking value is an “evasive object”, and we had to implement a specific research methodology in order to bring it to light and characterize it within the company. To analyze the interviews, we used an appropriate coding technique, through dedicated software (Modalisa). The research is carried through a double data analysis method, named etic - emic (or horizontal – vertical), aimed first at understanding what has a meaning in the respondent’s locutions, and then at identifying the elements of structure of the linking value from the meanings identified. Such reasoning requires that the interviewer has empathy capacities with the respondents. Our research brings the following results: • First, we qualify the “link experience” based on emotions, a reciprocity intention, an ethical functioning and shared confidence. • We then propose a characterization of linking value in the mutualist field, based on an extension to Rémy’s typology (2000), which is the current reference for services companies. • Next, we show how linking value emerges, depending on it being based on a priori activism, or on a posteriori relationship between the employees and the policy holder. • We establish the main characteristics of linking value: its capacity to temper the otherness created by the contract, an asymmetry between the partners of the exchange, the very lack of community feelings among members. • We expose the privileged expression vectors for this linking value: the empathy deployed by company’s employees and the solidarity schemes. • Recognition emerges also as a foundation to linking value. We register our reasoning in the field of recognition theory, as it founds an ethic of interpersonal relationship, constituent of social link. The mutual recognition dynamics allows each individual to experience a “collective revival”, and to share his belonging to a political or ethical community, without losing his identity. Mutualist insurance companies need to recognize such a pluralist community, in which each individual sees himself in the purpose of a company model, as this recognition founds linking value. We finally show that resuming the democratic ideals that historically founded Mutualist Associations is what will allow them to restore an authentic social link, in the spirit of modern mutualism."
"This thesis explores theoretical and empirical aspects of price formation and evolution at high frequency. We begin with the study of the joint dynamics of an option and its underlying. The high frequency data making observable the realized volatility process of the underlying, we want to know if this information is used to price options. We find that the market does not process this information to fix option prices. The stochastic volatility models are then to be considered as reduced form models. Nevertheless, this study tests the relevance of an empirical hedging parameter that we call effective delta. This is the slope of the regression of option price increments on those of the underlying. It proves to be a satisfactory model-independent hedging parameter. For the price dynamics, we turn our attention in the following chapters to more explicit models of market microstructure. One of the characteristics of the market activity is its clustering. Hawkes processes are point processes with this characteristic, therefore providing an adequate mathematical framework for the study of this activity. Moreover, the Markov property associated to these processes when the kernel is exponential allows to use powerful analytical tools such as the infinitesimal generator and the Dynkin formula to calculate various quantities related to them, such as moments or autocovariances of the number of events on a given interval. We begin with a monovariate framework, simple enough to illustrate the method, but rich enough to enable applications such as the clustering of arrival times of market orders, prediction of future market activity knowing past activity, or characterization of unusual shapes, but nevertheless observed, of signature plot, where the measured volatility decreases when the sampling frequency increases. Our calculations also allow us to make instantaneous calibration of the process by relying on the method of moments. The generalization to the multidimensional case then allow us to capture, besides the clustering, the phenomenon of mean reversion, which also characterizes the market activity observed in high frequency. General formulas for the signature plot are then obtained and used to connect its shape to the relative importance of clustering or mean reversion. Our calculations also allow to obtain the explicit form of the volatility associated with the diffusive limit, therefore connecting the dynamics at microscopic level to the macroscopic volatility, for example on a daily scale. Additionally, modelling buy and sell activity by Hawkes processes allows to calculate the market impact of a meta order on the asset price. We retrieve and explain the usual concave form of this impact as well as its relaxation with time. The analytical results obtained in the multivariate case provide the adequate framework for the study of the correlation. We then present generic results on the Epps effect as well as on the formation of the correlation and the lead lag."
"Does the CAP direct payment distribution benefit to the most environmentally friendly farms? Following an environmental assessment state of the art, a set of environmental indicators has been created to rank farms on their potential environmental impacts using FADN datas. Then, these classes have been connected with the amounts of direct payments received. Results are processed on three types of farm (specialized in cereals and oilseeds, meat cows and milk cows). Associated with a comprehensive study of the reforms of the CAP since 1992, this empirical study allows to stand back on the consequences of the political decisions. It seems that if the 2nd pillar direct payments are directed in favour of the more environmental friendly farms, their weight remains too low compared with the aids of the 1st pillar, which are higher in the less virtuous farms. This is largely connected to the weight of the DPU in the direct payments, and to the French choice to base their calculation with regard to the history of the farm. That is why the simulations of the redistribution of the subsidies of the 1st pillar on horizon 2019 show that the rebalancing of these payments between the farms by a national harmonization will contribute to level the gap of 1st pillar direct payments by hectare between french farms. The comparison with the United Kingdom and Germany shows the effects of the subsidiarity, in particular during the decoupling: the harmonization of the decoupled payments allows the most environmental friendly farms to get higher direct payments per hectare."
"This thesis aims to understand the meaning that the consumer ascribes to his acts when one practises electricity consumption control (ECC) inside the dwelling. The value perceived by consumers associated with the various ECC’s activities, as, for example, to switch off devices in sleep mode, constitute a reflection of the meaning the consumer confers to this practice.We wondered, at first, about the nature of the sources of valuation and depreciation which emerge from the ECC. We identified twenty five sources which are so many appreciations or depreciations of the ECC for the consumer. Then, we tried to determine how these sources are structured and we were able to determine that, for consumers, the value of the ECC is characterized by seven components. Four of them are components of appreciation (environmental and citizen, of household management, the eudemonistic well-being and secondary profits). The three other are components of depreciation (experiential, social and associated with a lack of knowledge).Subsequently, we tried to understand how the value of the ECC emerges from the practice itself. We, also, wondered about the role of the various components (of appreciation and depreciation) in the ECC valuation for the consumer and in the conduct of action. We were able to confirm that the more an individual realizes ECC’s gestures, the more he appreciates this practice via the components of appreciation and the less he depreciates it via the components of depreciation. We also noticed that the meaning of the practice evolves and expands when practice becomes intensified. Two main levers set apart: the appreciation of ECC through its consequences on the household management and the eudemonistic wellbeing which is removed from this practice by the individual. The first one has a very strong influence on the evaluation of ECC by the consumers, and the second, once an individual really practises ECC, drives him to continue along this path."
"Thanks to their internal consistency. DSGE models, built on microecoc behavor, have become prevalenl for business cycle and policy analysis in institutions. The recent crisis and governments' concern about persistent unemployment advocate for mechanism, capturing imperfect adjustments in credit and labor markets. However, popular models such as the one of Smets and Wouters (2003-2007), although unsophisticated in their representation of these markets, are able to replicate the data as well as usual econometric tools. It is thus necessary to question the benefits of including these frictions in theoretical models for operational use.ln this thesis, I address this issue and show that microfounded mechanisms specifiç to labor and credit markets can significantly alter the conclusions based on the use of an estimated DSGE model, fom both a positive and a normative perspective.For this purpose, I build a two-country model of France and the rest of the euro area with exogenous rest of the world variables, and estimate it with and without these two frictions using Bayesian techniques. By contrast with existing models, I propose two improvements of the representation of labor markets. First, following Pissarides (2009), only wages in new jobs are negotiated by firms and workers, engendering stickiness in the average real wage. Second, I develop a set of assumptions to make labor market participation endogenous and unemployment involuntary in the sense that the unemployed workers are worse-off that the employed ones. Yet, including this setup in the estimated model is left for future research.Using the four estimated versions of the model, I undertake a number of analyses to highlight the role of financial and labor market frictions : an historical shock decomposition of fluctuations during the crisis, the evaluation of several monetary policy rules, a counterfactual simulation of the crisis under the assumption of a flexible exchange rate regime between France and the rest of the euro area and, lastly, the simulation of social VAT scenarios."
"As part of our doctoral studies, we worked in an engineering school that has developed a partnership with the company Ecoway , for the development of Movin'out service innovation. Addressed to individuals ( BtoC ) , enterprises , service providers and communities ( BtoB) , this innovation comes in the form of a Community eco-mobility platform , to encourage individuals to adopt virtuous modes of transport , and therefore alternative to individual car use . Unfortunately, Movin'out responsible for innovation does not meet the expected success for our presence in the search field and was rejected by potential adopters without generating the communautary effect.Despite the wealth of literature on the diffusion and adoption of innovations, it remains fragmented. Indeed, different approaches have emerged at the crossroads of several disciplines (economics, sociology, management, psychology, etc.) (Masson, Weil and Hatchuel, 2006). So, to answer the central question of this thesis and to register our work in the theoretical field of marketing innovation, we primarily focused on the linear approach developed by Rogers (2003) for an analysis at the individual level as well as work on virtual communities (Rheingold, 1993; Kozinets, 1999, 2002, 2010) for a discussion at the collective level of innovation. However, these approaches, disregarding the social environment of the individual and the interactions it may have with the object (innovation) and other individuals (networks), we complete the work sociology of innovation to emphasize the importance of interaction in networks for the successful construction of innovation.We find that every theoretical approach taken separately by focusing on a level of analysis, whether individual or collective actor, can provide an overall view of the diffusion and adoption of innovations. Also, our goal is to provide an integrative approach at the crossroads of marketing and sociology of innovation to analyze the failed construction of a responsible service innovation in the making, on an emerging market, the ecomobility. The integrative approach is thus situated at different levels of observation: the individual, the community, the network. The bias of this thesis is to articulate these in order to identify and analyze the behavior of resistance to innovations. Our contribution lies in the mobilization of this inclusive approach to study a little treated in the literature about: the failure of an innovation."
"The industrial model of food production, consumption and distribution has been criticised since the seventies in reference to its environmental, social and economical impacts. These critics led to the emergence of a diversity of socio-economic initiatives, engaged in the promotion of a model of agriculture that is more respectful of the planet and its inhabitants, based on new organizational forms and oriented towards fair economic exchange. These alternative food systems refer to a diversity of production methods, including responsible and organic farming, agroecology, permaculture. Alternative food systems generally rely on organisations engaged in a social or solidarity economy : Community supported agriculture, short food supply channels, cooperatives, local fair trade. They reconsider the purpose and terms of economic activity and are driven by a desire to engage in an alternative economy. The question of fairness in exchange, embodied by the will to define a fair price, is of central matter for these initiatives.In this context, this thesis aims at analysing the construction of a fair price within an alternative food system. This system is engaged in a dynamic of local fair trade, and is based on an innovative organizational form.  An empirical study has been conducted during three years within the cooperative Alter-Conso. This social cooperative proposes a weekly distribution of local and organic food products, in 14 delivery points in and around the city of Lyon. It puts forward the values and principle of a social and solidarity economy, and brings together into cooperation four categories of members : employees, producers, consumers, supporters. In this sense, economic activity aims primarily at achieving a social and political goal, oriented towards a transformation of agricultural practices and questioning the dominant management practices of economic life. The thesis aims at analysing how the members of the cooperative construct a fair price, considering its social project and its organizational form.The thesis shows that the construction of a fair price articulates three forms of justice : distributive , commutative, and procedural.  It shows how the cooperative defines a price definition process that is an alternative to the market price. Indeed, the price construction takes into account the values and social goals of the cooperative, both in the criteria that define a fair price and in the price fixation process. The price construction is based on a discussion among the cooperative’s stakeholders, regardless of the variations of supply and demand. It is constructed on the basis of a lasting, comprehensive and tripartite relationship between the producers, the consumers, and the cooperative employees. The relationship is based on reciprocity and on the recognition of the needs of all the people affected by the exchange."
"This thesis concerns three studies on the impact of ASEAN trade integration and investment liberalization following empirical research agenda of the new economic geography (NEG).  Empirical strategies deal with measuring trade costs, market access and the estimation of modern gravity models. The first study evaluates trade integration progress in ASEAN and its impact on export performance with help of trade costs and market access indicators. The second study examines how improved market access, though deepening trade liberalization, can impact regional inequality. The third study investigates the impact of investment agreement on FDI attractiveness of the ASEAN countries. The results help shed light on potential benefits and challenges ahead of the upcoming ASEAN Economic Community at the end of 2015."
"In this Ph. D. thesis, we analyze the conditions for the emergence and the aggravation of the recent crisis in Europe from 2008 to 2012. The major objective of this Ph. D. thesis is to develop theoretical models which will be effective in investigating the twin banking and sovereign debt crises in a monetary union with a broadly similar institutional design to the EMU before 2012. Different from 'traditional' financial crisis models that shed light on the role of the central bank in crisis policy response, the models developed in this thesis investigate and underline the importance of fiscal crisis management. White accentuating financial vulnerability, we explore the relationship between the banking sector, the realeconomy and the public budget in the context of a monetary union. This thesis consists of four theoretical models of the banking crisis, with the first framework depicting the financial crisis which burst in 2008 in small European economies outside the EMU and the next three models elucidating the crisis situation in the Eurozone from early 2009 until August 2012."
"J. S. Mill was one of the main targets of a whole critical literature denouncing the pretention of economics to universality, that is to say, to establish natural laws. Among the criticisms one can detect two different angles of attack: that of authors such as Durkheim, Veblen or Schmoller who criticize the claim of political economy to reduce man to a mere homo œconomicus, and consequently to glorify “laissez-faire”; that of Marx who castigates the naturalizing character of capitalist private property in the economic discourse. However, by closely examining Mill’s epistemological texts, we show that this author just happens to be the advocate of his own critics. However, there is no guarantee that Mill says all the truth about his own practice as an economist. Now, we demonstrate that some of his economic writings present indeed a form of universality, in as much as they are not only valid in capitalist market economies."
"The objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the existing knowledge about foreign aid, either about its consequences on the developing world or about its implications for developed economies. Chapter 1 shows that aid improves public institutions when aid is allocated by multilateral agencies. The benefits of aid are even more valuable in countries not reliant on their oil resources rents. In Chapter 2 we analyse the possible Granger causal relationships running between foreign aid and corruption in developing countries. Our data reveal that aid does not result in more or less corruption, and reversely corruption does not exert a significant influence on future assistance. In Chapter 3 we evidence that foreign assistance enhances the recipient country's efficiency of production, in particular when the country has democratic and macroeconomic sound institutions. Chapter 4 reports our data analysis on donors' domestic policies. Aid, migration and unemployment policies are recognized to be tightly connected for OECD donors. Specifically, aid policies are partly shaped by the burden of unemployment and the stock of migrants observed in the donor country."
"The understanding of organization and production modes of scientific knowledge by economists remains limited despite recent developments in the economics of science (Dasgupta and David,1994, Nelson, 2004, Stephan, 2008). However, research and innovation have become major issues for the competitiveness of European economies and their growth (Meyer-Krahmer, 1989). This thesis draws the publicʼs attention not only towards the role of the individual researcher in the scientific production process but also towards the role of research laboratories and their composition in terms of human resources and types of funding. The case of the French academic research system, in which we find a mixed structure between the academic and institutional laboratories, also allows us to distinguish the role of public research organizations such as CNRS or INSERM in the organization and production of collective knowledge. These organizations, which are devoted to basic or fundamental research, provide an undeniable contribution to economic growth (Stephan, 1996). More specifically, the objective of this work is to highlight the characteristics of the scientific production and quality processes. It focuses on issues related to the characteristics of scientific production and quality namely the determinants of human and financial resources of these phenomena on the one hand and the existing relationships between different elements resulting from the decomposition of these two types of resources on the other hand. In summary, this work focuses on issues related to team and fund composition within research laboratories as determinants of scientific production and quality, on the collaboration between different types of researchers and complementary relationships between different types of funding for public research."
"In this dissertation, my research aims at dwelling on the questions, at understanding and explaining -- as a follow of current strand of literature on financial frictions -- the mechanisms that allowed the imperfect and perfect credit intermediation to affect the dynamics of economy and the transmission of monetary policy, and providing a new theoretical formulation for evaluating the unconventional monetary policy. To do this, I first considered the impact of financial intermediation on the analysis of central bank transparency issue (Chapter 2). ln Chapter 3, I focused on the role played by the imperfect financial intermediation/financial frictions in the transmission of shocks : through which mechanisms, do the presence of balance-sheet constraint financial intermediaries affect the effect of shocks on the macroeconomy? Finally, in Chapter 4, 1 construct an theoreticalmodel to analyze an important issue which have net been carried out in existing literature: the transmission mechanism of the central bank's large-scale purchase of mortgage-backed securities. ln this chapter, I first simulated a financial crisis to see if the model is able to replicate some of the most important stylized facts of the Great Recession. Then, basing on the simulated crisis, I examine the efficacy and transmission mechanism of large scale purchases of MBS through comparing these purchases to the purchases of corporate bonds. This experiment is conducted in two credit market configurations, i.e., a partially and a totally segmented credit market. The latter case of market condition is considered by many economists as main obstacle that impedes the nominal functioning of the financial markets. ln this work, we have obtained rich and important findings for guiding the use of unconventional monetary policy. The following parts briefly present the findinqs of the thesis."
"This PhD research aims at better understanding the link between work life balance policies and gender equality in the workplace. The objective is to understand how these measures can influence sexual roles division at work.By referring to the theoretical framework of social perceptions, our work is based on two main case studies, with 44 semi-oriented interviews “major tool to identify perceptions”, as the main method to collect data. We chose to conduct the two case studies in two different countries: France and Spain, because of their contrasted approach towards work life balance topic: rather traditional for France, more intrusive and individualized for Spain.The results highlight the heterogeneity and the gendered character of the employees’ perceptions of work life balance policies; those ones also appear to be strongly connected to the manager behavior and its management style. The categorization of perceptions (progressist/ traditionalist/ neutral/ hostile) contributes to a better understanding of their influence on gender equality, and reveals that inequalities awareness –stronger amongst Spanish employees- is a prior condition for a more equal work life balance."
"Why do we take risks or we do not? Why do not we recycle more? Under uncertainty what do we expect will happen to our home prices? These and many other questions are asked on daily basis.For possible explanations and answers to these and similar questions principles of behavioural economics can be used. Behavioural economics (BE) is the combination of psychology and economics that investigates what happens in markets in which some of agents display human limitations and complications (Mullainathan and Thaler, 2000). Behavioural economics provides more realistic psychological foundations to increase explanatory and predictive power of economic theory. The study of behavioural economics has inspired a number of different theories and has been used in many applications, and this thesis follows the same path and investigates different applications of behavioural economics. This thesis explores three novel applications of behavioural economics to management, policy making and property investment decision making."
"This thesis analyzes the economic development issues related to the medium and long-term dynamics of commodities prices in general and cotton prices in particular. Studies on the long-term perspective traditionally question the relevance of primary specializations of LDCs. In the medium term, the interest is relates to price instability for which the consequences are all the more important as countries’ dependency on the exports of such products becomes stronger. The stakes then revolve around market regulation modalities, and the choice of risk management tools (e.g. public or private interventions). These depend on the apprehension of price fluctuations as a phenomenon arising from endogenous or exogenous market factors. In a new economical context influenced by the growing importance of oligopolistic firms, a segmentation of the productive process and the financialization of commodity markets, we address differently these issues through a new analytical framework. The proposed analysis first shows how approaches such as the ones related to global value chains are more adapted to tackle industrial/commercial policies in commodity dependent LDCs. Second, in a context of heterogeneous behavioral models, we rely on the concept of bounded rationality to show the presence of a strong endogenous component in instability. Thus, it proves the inefficiency of private interventions to counter instability. Considering these findings in the case of African cotton producers, we conclude that it remains possible to incorporate the commodity in a global development strategy. But this involves the use of hybrid-type mechanisms (public-private) for managing uncertainty, combined with a reinforcement of cross-border cooperation dynamics in order to structure regional value chains."
"This thesis focuses on the Tunisian bankruptcy process. The objective is to treat the subject from a macroeconomic, microeconomic and legal point of view. The work is preceded by a literature review focused on the main actors in the bankruptcy process: debtors, creditors and bankruptcy law. The first part provides a summary of many research results relating on the one hand, to the different strategies set by debtors and creditors to protect their own interests and on the other hand to the effectiveness of the procedures in preventing any opportunistic uses of the law. In the second part, we seek to determine the effect of macroeconomic fluctuations on the failure rate of businesses in Tunisia over the period 1997-2010. The selected variables are those that have been frequently used in the literature and that showed their significant impact onto the rate of corporate failure. Other original variables, more specific to the Tunisian case were considered to account for the importance of industry and tourism sectors in the Tunisian economy. The third part of this thesis focuses on the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures in Tunisia, a country characterized by the importance of its banking sector. We gathered original and unique information on Tunisian firms that went bankrupt between 1995-2009. We find that the Tunisian reorganization procedures are able to generate substantial recoveries, but those are mainly captured by the preferential claims (employees and public claims). This is coherent with the authorities’ willingness to improve social protection, but this raises concerns as the Tunisian firms are mainly financed by bankers. Our analysis shows that the secured creditors are poorly protected under bankruptcy: they rank almost last in the priority order of repayment, and their recovery rate is similar to one of the unsecured creditors. We also find that the rather high level of recovery rate is mainly attributable to the reorganization procedures. We finally find that the court’s choice between reorganization and liquidation is not influenced by the structure of claims. Thus, in Tunisia, the creditors are losing hand once bankruptcy is triggered.To better understand the characteristics of Tunisian bankruptcy procedures, the last part of the thesis offers a comparative study of Tunisian bankruptcy law with 18 other European and non-European countries. Ten legal indexes were constructed through ""Law and Finance"" approach to ""measure"" ten functions of bankruptcy law.Univariate and multivariate analyzes were conducted to identify the similarity or disparity points between the various bankruptcy laws."
"The aim of this thesis is to identify and investigate some limits regarding recent empirical and theoretical contributions in the field of farmers' behavior as related to tea production in Vietnam. Chapter 1 provides a quick overview about tea production in the world and in Vietnam. Chapter 2 in our thesis analyzes the technical efficiency of the tea production in Vietnam. This study finds that the average technical efficiency of tea production is very low (only about 41\%).  Chapter 3 presents a theoretical model in order to figure out the farmer's decision to adopt for organic production. The decision concerns the allocation of lands for conventional and organic products.It shows the importance of (i) the available quantity of land devoted to agricultural plants, (ii) the productivity of the organic products, (iii) the incentive mechanism, and finally (iv) the constraints on output of organic products. In Chapter 4, we compared two version of econometric model: a model with household's unobserved heterogeneity and a model without unobserved heterogeneity. We found that the former model is preferred. The results revealed that some important factors which influence the adoption of tea varieties included tea income, presence of elderly, household size and use of organic fertilizers. In Chapter 5, we focus on investigating the impacts of political connections both farmer's total income and tea income. The findings indicate the significant role of political connection on improving farming households' income."
"With constant rises in healthcare expenditures, the creation and use of innovative technologies in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) is increasingly dependent on our ability to demonstrate their efficiency and evaluate their impacts. To date, as we show throughout this thesis, the economic literature has not provided decision makers and analysts with the adequate tools to perform such evaluations.Our work combines the best aspects of health economics and economics of innovation to establish a common methodological framework for the evaluation of hybrid innovations in MIS. Using the Institute of Image Guided Surgery (IHU Strasbourg) as a base for our investigations, we create the groundwork for a comprehensive cost-benefit evaluation covering the institute’s patient care and R\&D activities.The use of the tools developed in this thesis will allow the IHU, or any other surgical institute, to provide advocacy for these types of activities by demonstrating that the socio-economic impacts of a surgical innovation can possibly outweigh the additional cost it incurs to the healthcare system."
"The three essays focus on the process of firm growth, its persistence, and on the role of innovation in affecting firm performance. In the first essay we concentrate on persistence of high-growth and investigate whether this peculiar growth pattern is associated with better operating capabilities. The second essay aims to explore the relationship between growth and innovation, taking into accountthe multidimensional nature of the innovation process. We provide a broad picture of the relationship between growth and innovation, by looking at a wide set of innovation variables that capture the different sources, modes and types of innovative activity undertaken within firms. In the third essay we examine the role of persistence of innovation on persistence of growth performance, assessing whether a systematic, rather than sporadic, engagement in innovation activities induces more structure in the process of firm growth."
"This thesis aims at contributing to the recent studies which investigate the short-run effects of fiscal policy on economic activity. More precisely, three main aspects of fiscal policy in the short run are analyzed. First, one major message is that the impact of fiscal policy on the economy depends strongly on the fiscal instrument used by the government. Rising transfers to households, increasing public investment or cutting social protection tax trigger very different effects on key macroeconomic variables and especially on output. Second, one large part of this thesis is dedicated to the analysis of the effects of fiscal policy shocks on the labor market. One main result is that we cannot determine unemployment fiscal multipliers according to the value of the output fiscal multiplier, especially because of the response of the labor force participation to fiscal policy shocks. Third, this is well-known that many elements influence the size of the output fiscal multiplier. Two of these elements are considered throughout this thesis: the position of the economy over the business cycle and the behavior of the monetary policy. The two first chapters of this thesis analyze these different aspects in some closed economy models. The two last chapters extend this study at the case of a monetary union by investigating the spillover effects of fiscal policy between member states but also the stabilizing properties of fiscal transfer mechanisms between member states in order to soften cyclical shocks."
"This research aims at describing and interpreting the issues and the evolutions of corporate socialresponsibility in China. If the foundations of CSR are now well established in Western societies, wechoose to direct our work towards the study of China. From commitment to the traditional Confucianthought, political transitions of the Mao era and the opening up towards the West in the late 1970sproviding multinational corporations access to the country, the first part describes the evolution ofChinese society throughout its history and the emergence of CSR. We then explore the possibility of aChinese generational break by studying the “post ‘80s” generation. Finally, an online survey and aseries of interviews result on the assessment of values and social representations of CSR amongstudents."
"This thesis contributes to both theoretical and empirical aspects of the literature on the labor market in macroeconomics. On the theoretical side, I provide insights both on the impact of labor market institutions on monetary policy and on the efficiency of fiscal policy according to the business cycle position. On the empirical side, I discuss the spillover effects of the Germany’s labor market reforms on its trade partners. How do labor markets institutions affect monetary policy? Has fiscal policy the same effect on labor market during economic downturns than during economic upturns? Can the German labor market and fiscal reforms account for Germany’s new trading performances?"
"Following two World Wars, the societal consideration of disability has considerably evolved. Most of countries have implemented national disability policies in order to improve disabled people professional integration. Nevertheless, in order to be part of such policies, disability first needs to be institutionally disclosed. Institutional disclosure is far from being automatic as disability is frequently concealed since university. In this perspective, based on the decision making theories this thesis aims at understanding the institutional disclosure process. We focus on the specific case of students with disabilities. A qualitative study based on semi structured interviews, life story interviews, participant observations and secondary data analysis has been conducted. Our results show that several individual and environmental reasons affect disclosure motivations. The consequences of disclosure can be analyzed in terms of expectancies confirmation and disconfirmation. Finally disclosure follows four distinctive strategies."
"In the current complex and open innovation landscape, researchers have given special attention in the relationship between academia and industry, focusing mainly on the role of universities. But Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) are also an important, yet understudied, part of public research world. The purpose of this PhD project is to study the role of RTOs in the open service innovation landscape, taking a dual perspective. More specifically, in the first part of the project, we undertake a theoretical analysis together with case studies in 4 selected and renowned RTOs, in order to identify the unique service innovation capabilities of RTOs. In the second part of the project we take an external perspective, comparing RTOs to TTOs/ universities in terms of their “offering” to their partners. The analysis is performed on the conceptual level but also empirically based on statistical analysis of the Community Innovation Survey data. Our overall results indicate that RTOs represent a superior type of intermediary in open innovation that are able not only to facilitate but also to catalyse the innovation process."
"In this thesis, we propose to mode! individuals' reaction to a nudge, based on the announcement of the socially optimal contribution. We want to compare the efficiency of this incentive, with the efficiency of a tax to improve environmental quality. We test the theoretical predictions we obtained in a laboratory experiment. We show that the reaction to our nudge depends on subjects' environmental sensitivity, contrary to the tax. ln a second experiment, we test the existence of persistent effects of these two instruments in the long term. We also consider a mix tool (tax and nudge), to raise subjects' awareness (with the nudge) that they are taxed because their behaviour is not optimal. ln the last chapter, we extend our analysis considering agents arranged in fixed networks. We analyze how the equilibria are shaped under the implementation of our nudge."
"A growing interest is given to women entrepreneurs in the public and academic arena. (Hughes et al., 2012), as well as to the actors and practices of the entrepreneurial support industry (Fayolle, 2004; Sammut, 2003). However, few studies are conducted on the entrepreneurial support of women entrepreneurs (Lebègue, 2015). Women entrepreneurs show some specificities and academics call for a greater coherence between the needs and wants of entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial support practices (Verstraete, 2002; Chabaud et al., 2010). Moreover, the studies on women entrepreneurs are centered on their hurdles more than on their levers. Thanks to a qualitative approach, our results first show the hurdles of levers of women entrepreneurs through the 5Ms canvas of women’s entrepreneurship (Brush et al., 2009). The main levers appear to be entrepreneurial support and awareness, and perceived self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997; McGee et al., 2009). Then, our results concern the implementation and evaluation phases of the intervention-research led in an entrepreneurship center. Our contribution is to give an insight on different entrepreneurial support processes – one of them is compatible with the four profiles of women entrepreneurs. We also highlight different forms of entrepreneurial awareness that further entrepreneurial commitment of women."
"The thesis aims to establish an optimal technological risk management to ensure hazard reduction of new emerging risks without impeding the innovation path. The research work contributes to ex-ante and ex-post risk management strategies and provides theoretical and empirical evidence to address the management of new emerging risks. The first part of the thesis examines, from the perspective of Law and Economics, the effectiveness of the tort liability rule for the situation where the decision maker is lacking information about the probability of an event to occur. The second part of the thesis pays particular attention to the environmental energy transition in France and focus on the insurability of the energy performance in the housing sector. The theoretical and experimental findings from the first part of the research convey strong validity that tort law cannot provide ex-ante optimal incentives when there is lacking information about the probability of accident. The regime of unlimited and limited liability leads to overinvestment in prevention in regard to new emerging risks. The empirical results of the second part of the thesis reveal that 23.75% of households participated in the weatherization program ""Je Rénove BBC"" do not achieve the required energy target but the severity of the energy performance gap is relatively low. The findings of the research work imply several policy recommendations to manage new emerging technologies in the future."
This dissertation presents the results of different aspects of monetary analysis for the Russian economy. This is mostly a novel research that was not applied to Russia previously. In some cases we contribute to the literature not only by conducting Russia-specific analysis but also by applying our tools to the cross-section of emerging market economies.
"The main objective in management of any organization is a successful and sustainable performance. To survive over time, a company should combine two competing activities. On the one hand, it must exploit existing certainties to be effective in the short term, and on the other hand, being capable at the same time to explore new opportunities to be innovative in the future. Ambidextrous organizations have the ability to pursue these activities simultaneously and produce radical and incremental innovation. In our research, we show that to achieve ambidexterity separation of activities is important, but not sufficient. Without integration between business structures and processes, the exploratory activity of the innovation unit is more likely to shrink and disappear with time as unprofitable function. To survive and sustain in the long term, a company should adapt fractal and dynamic ambidexterity. This new concept provides us with a solution to the question of balance and determines the organizational ability to define and set the appropriate proportions of exploration and exploitation simultaneously at multiple organizational levels and re-configure them when it is necessary to meet the change."
"Bank liquidity risk reflects the function of banks to create liquidity. Banks are fragile, exposed to the possibility of runs from short-term creditors. This dissertation contributes to a better understanding of bank liquidity risk. The second chapter proposes a measure of bank fragility based on the value of the assets held by a bank. Results confirm, in an original way, the fragile nature of banks. However, bank liquidity creation benefits to the economy. The third chapter analyses the capacity of banks to produce liquidity in conjunction with their choices in terms of activity and business model. Determinants of the efficiency to produce liquidity appear to be the bank capacity to produce information through a relationship-oriented business model and to benefit from informational synergies through the activity mix. Nevertheless, excessive exposition of banks to liquidity risk results in bank liquidity crises. The fourth chapter investigates bank exposition to liquidity risk depending on the evolution of aggregate liquidity conditions. Results underline the heterogenous effect of liquidity shocks on the risk borne by banks."
"This thesis aims to study the evolution of the labor supply of individuals at the entry into adulthood. It consists of two major themes. First of all, we discuss the labor supply decisions of young adults and the links existing between labor supply and family environment as well as public policies. Second, we discuss the impact of the first birth on the labor supply of mothers and fathers. We find that the family environment is a factor of inequality between young adults and that the implementation of minimum income policies would reduce these inequalities. With regard to the birth of a child, it is mainly educated women who are penalized at the wage level over the short and medium terms. It seems that public policies, but also firms, have an important role to play in mothers' return to work behaviors."
This dissertation studies the corporate bond market. Results emphasize the role of legal environment and governance. The first chapter demonstrates the role of creditors’ protection and information on the corporate bond market. It identifies a non-homogenous impact across firms. The second chapter uses a meta-analysis to scrutinize the effect of a bond offering on the firm’s value. It stresses the reasons underlying diverging results in the literature so far. The third chapter focuses on the Chinese corporate bond market and highlights the role of state and management ownership on the value created by a bond offering. The fourth chapter isolates a religious bias from professional investors and contributes to the literature on the impact of behavioural biases on the firm’s value.
"To assure their long term survival, organizations depend on discontinuous innovations. This type of innovation is nurtured by collective creativity between employees of an organization’s subsidiaries starting from the early phase of the innovation process (fuzzy front-end). Management faces an important challenge here: how to innovate if employees are not physically located at the same place? This research proposes an innovative approach to compensate geographic space at the fuzzy front-end. The resulting ProxIS-Telescope represents a compact solution for organizations in order to enhance the collaboration between employees independently of their location and to create unexpected combinations of knowledge. Furthermore, this research reveals that a crucial challenge for companies is not only the international expansion during the fuzzy front-end, but also the management of a growing workforce. The dynamic extension of the ProxIS-model proposes thus appropriate solutions for each organizational type depending on the number of actors and the international dimension during the fuzzy front-end."
"Like most industrial companies, the Paul Hartmann company firstly deployed the Lean approach in factories. The implementation of Lean Office basic principles is decided through the Office Excellence method (Kugel, 2010) in the procurement support department. This method applied in some major German companies since 2002 has not been scientifically tested yet. Our research aims at testing this method with a unique case study approach and evaluating its completeness in comparison to the Lean Office’s concept base. A first contribution is made through a literature review for defining this Lean Office’s concept base. The five year-case study starts with a failure; the action-research moves to an intervention-research. After systematically challenging the case study learnings with the literature, our constructivist approach enables proposing an original Lean Office implementation method for practitioners’ use: Lean Office@SCM. It is a mixed approach made of a managerial part in parallel, and an operational one insequences."
"The issue is to know what package of hospital management could be adjusted to another country. How could it be apply ? How is building cooperation and what tools of French hospital management could be adjusted? The first part is about the establishment and the steering of a project between Nanchang’s hospital (N°3) and the hospital of La Rochelle. It includes managerial cooperation between France and China enlightened by scientific publications and explains how cooperation is building between French and Chinese hospitals. It also talks about the reasons why they decided to cooperate. Then, it is about how to manage cooperation between French and Chinese hospitals including the economic agents, the institutions, the development and the difficulties. The second part is about required tools and methods to prepare a transfer. It details some examples that could be reused. Finally, it explains how were selected the two projects, the organisation of medical activity and the development of management control. The third part is about testing. To conclude, it explains how succeeding a partnership between French and Chinese hospitals in order to get to a successful cooperation between both institutions."
"In the current context of fierce competition, the Information Systems of SME are increasingly based on “off-theshelf” products like the ERP - Enterprise Resource Planning - systems. As this kind of system offers a generic solution, the alignment between the company’s real needs and the ERP standard functionalities must be ensured. Therefore, we propose to define the so called Misalignment Risk (MR). Our literature review on project risk management leads us to propose two complementary strategies to manage the MR allowing its optimization: the first one works on the effect of the MR and the second one, on its occurrence. Our analysis of the model driven engineering methods, allowing the implementation of the first strategy, shows that: the alignment processes proposed to identify the misalignment, to evaluate its effect and to mitigate it are too macroscopic. Concerning the means to implement the second strategy, we highlight the weaknesses of the tools proposed to support the identification and treatment of the risk factors influencing the MR. We thus propose, firstly the “Model Driven -ERP Alignment” method allowing (i) the identification of the alignment and misalignment situations in a detailedmanner and on the basis of the ISO 19440 norm, (ii) the evaluation of its effect and (iii) its association to adequate decisions. The granularity level and the interdependencies of the processes’ activities are also taken into account. Secondly we propose the “Risk-Factor Driven - ERP Alignment” approach. It consists in the proposition of a process allowing the identification and treatment of risk factors (RF) influencing the MR. to succeed in following tools are set up: RF variables, RF residual link matrix, RF life cycle classification and RF / management practices matrix. As this work is supported by both the Region Alsace and a SME located near Strasbourg, we follow an action / research approach. It allowed us to apply and validate our contributions."
"Pedestrians are regarded as an extremely vulnerable and high-risk group of road users since they are unprotected in vehicle impacts. More than 1.17 million people throughout the world are killed in road traffic accidents each year. Where, about 65% of deaths involve pedestrians. The head injuries in vehicle-pedestrian collisions accounted for about 30% of all reported injuries on different body regions, which often resulted in a fatal consequence. Such injuries can result in disabilities and long-term sequence, which lead to significant social costs. It is therefore important to study the characteristics of pedestrian accidents and understand the head injury mechanism of the pedestrian so as to improve vehicle design for pedestrian protection. The aim of this study is to investigate pedestrian dynamic response and develop head injury risk functions.In order to investigate the effect of pedestrian gait, vehicle front geometry and impact velocity on the dynamic responses of the head, the multi-body dynamic (MBD) models were used to simulate the head responses in vehicle to pedestrian collisions with different vehicle types in terms of head impact point measured with Wrap Around Distance (WAD), head relative velocity and impact angle. A simulation matrix is established using five vehicle types, and two mathematical models of the pedestrians represented a 50th male adult and a 6 year old child as well as seven pedestrian gaits based on typical postures in pedestrian accidents. In order to simulate a large range of impact conditions, four vehicle velocities (30 km/h, 40 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h) are considered for each pedestrian position and vehicle type.A total of 43 passenger car versus pedestrian accidents were selected from In-depth Investigation of Vehicle Accidents in Changsha, China (IVAC) and German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database for simulation study. According to real-world accident investigation, accident reconstructions were conducted using multi-body system (MBS) pedestrian and car models under MADYMO simulation environment to calculate head impact conditions, in terms of head impact velocity, head position and head orientation. In order to study kinematics of adult pedestrian, relationship curves: head impact time, throw distance, head impact velocity and vehicle impact velocity, were computed and logistic regression models: head impact velocity, resultant angular velocity, HIC value, head contact force and head injuries, were developed based on the results from accident reconstructions.The automobile windshield, with which pedestrians come into frequent contact, has been identified as one of the main contact sources for pedestrian head injuries. In order to investigate the mechanical behavior of windshield laminated glass in the caseof pedestrian head impact, windshield FE models were set up using different combination for the modeling of glass and PVB, with various connection types and two mesh sizes (5 mm and 10 mm). Each windshield model was impacted with a standard adult headform impactor in an LS-DYNA simulation environment, and the results were compared with the experimental data reported in the literatures.In order to assess head injury risks of adult pedestrians, accident reconstructions were carried out by using Hybrid III head model based on the real-world pedestrian accidents. The impact conditions were obtained from the MBS simulation, including head impact velocity, head position and head orientation. They were used to set the initial conditions in a simulation of a Hybrid III FE head model striking a windshield FE model. Logistic regression models, Skull Fracture Correlate (SFC), head linear acceleration, Head Impact Power (HIP), HIC value, resultant angular acceleration and head injuries, were developed to study brain injury risk.{...]"
"Compared to traditional business services, IT-enabled services provide more value to customers and providers by enabling traditional business services with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and delivering them via e-channels (i.e., Internet, Mobile networks). Although IT-enabled service systems help in co-creating value through collaboration with customers during service design and delivery, they raise challenges when we attempt to understand, design and produce innovative and intelligent IT-enabled services from a multi-disciplinary perspective by including businesses, technology and people for value addition and increasing benefits. Due to their social-technical nature and characteristics (i.e., Intangibility, Inseparability, Perishability, Simultaneity), IT-enabled services also lack common methods to systemize services driven by customer requirements and their satisfactions and co-produce them through ad-hoc collaboration. In this thesis, we propose a middle-out methodology to model, design and systemize advanced IT-enabled service driven by customer requirements and collaboration among all actors to jointly co-create service systems. From a multi-disciplinary perspective, the methodology relies on a multi-view models including a service system reference model, a requirement model and a collaboration model to ensure system flexibility and adaptability to requirement changes and take into account joint efforts and collaboration of all service actors. The reference model aims at a multi-disciplinary description of services (ontological, systematical and characteristic-based descriptions), and formalizing business knowledge related to different domains. As for the requirement model, customer needs are specified in common expressiveness language understandable by all service actors and made possible its top-down propagation throughout service lifecycle and among actors. The collaboration model advocates a data-driven approach, which increases busi-ness, technical and semantic interoperability and exhibits stability in comparison to business processes centric approaches. Finally, the collaboration hinges on de-livery channels expressed as data flows and encapsulating business artifacts as per which business rules are generated to invoke underlying software components."
"We initialised this piece of research in order to explore methods that could humanise the implementation of NPM principles and make changes in hospital environments socially more acceptable. Compatible with a polyphonic management, favourable to change when people with different values and opposing interests have to co-operate around one same issue, Actor Network sociology became an obvious assessment matrix for a change process that we have been observing  and conducting via two projects that aim to retain staff. .Lead in a transformative approach, our research and intervention is based on two similar case-studies undertaken in public hospitals that have to face chronic shortages in nursing staff in psychiatric wards. Our ethnographic connection with the field was possible thanks to a CIFRE. It enabled us to obtain all kinds of rich and diversified data. We thereby brought our contribution to identifying what determines the initial intentions of psychiatric nursing staff in France, thanks to the organisation of multi-disciplinary workshops. During the second part of the implementation of our projects, thought-out in total collaboration with the actors on the field, we determined the actual obstacles to change as well as change-facilitators."
"The present dissertation uses recent data to identify continuities and ruptures in the perception of the European Union held by European citizens. We especially question the extent to which economic drivers shape public support for the European Union. New data sources are used to carry out the empirical analysis in our study. The dependant variables in each chapters are designed to identify precise aspects o public support. From a theoretical perspective, our findings confirm that regardless of the dependent variable and the method used, a sizeable majority of EU citizens are supportive of the EU, while the other half of the European population appears as uncertain. This broa cleavage is explained to a large extend by socioeconomic determinants. Highly skilled respondents with high incomes display more pro­EU attitudes in each of the dimensions of public support considered in the empirical analysis. Alongside this result, which is already well­known in the literature, the present dissertation emphasizes several limitations to the explanatory power of economic variables. ln the first chapter, we show that, to distinguish between individuals hostile to the idea of European integration and those who are only uncertain (or ambivalent), the domestic political offer should be taken into account. Chapter two highlights the fact that economic variables do not explain affective support i.e. diffuse support, stable over time which is crucial to the legitimacy of European institutions and to ensure the continuity of the EU. Finally, in the last chapter, it appears that the theoretical frameworks applied to former member states cannot be applied to new member states."
"The growing energy prices due to the rarefaction of the fossil fuels and the consideration of the environmental impacts makes inevitable the involvement of industrials to promote energy efficiency policy and emissions reductions. We notice that the Non-energy intensive industry (NEI), by opposition to the energy intensive industry (EI), is expected to play an important role because of their economic and energy importance and its relatively high growth rate. It becomes then a priority target especially since it has been neglected in energy analysis despite the continuing policy interest in energy efficiency and the many reports and book written on the topic. How can NEI contribute effectively to the reduction of the energy consumptions and the CO2 emissions? Which technologies and/or policies should be implemented to reach these objectives?This PhD work is then based on a technical economic optimization of the sectoral energy system, by using a “bottom-up” model with TIMES framework, in a relevant prospective approach of the energy and environmental consequences of MDE policies in NEI. This model relies on a representation by energy end-uses contrary to the EI because of the unsuitability of the approach product/process. As part of this, we analyzed the industrial heat recovery on processes through the deployment of HP in Food & Drink industry, the most important NEI's sector.Then, this prospective modelling allows observing the shape of investments of HP in response to energy constraints or incentive policies within the mechanism of Energy Savings Certificate or valuation of CO2 emissions. It can give, on one hand, a possibility of study which giving the different adjustment of a tax on gas emissions by the authorities of regulation to reach their environmental and energy objectives in NEI over a medium or long-term horizon. On the other hand, it is very useful as a good decision-making tool by determining differentiated costs for energy savings within the investments of efficient technologies at the highest level of disaggregation for a better sectoral screening"
"In the last decade, the photovoltaic market was multiplied by 10, module price was reduced by 60%, and China increased its share in cell and module production from almost nothing to more than half. The purpose of this thesis is to shed light on the mechanisms driving these transformations. We analyse how China managed to acquire the photovoltaic technology, relying on interviews with actors of the Chinese photovoltaic industry, and data gathered on patents related to the photovoltaic technology. We show that intellectual property rights did not play a significant role, Chinese firms getting access to the technology by buying manufacturing equipment from industrialised countries, and from labour mobility. The cost decrease is analysed with experience curves models, allowing us to forecast a further cost decrease of two thirds by 2020, provided that the market follows the high predicted expansion. It gives some insight regarding when photovoltaic technology will become competitive. An important attention is dedicated to feed-in tariffs which largely participated in driving the demand so far. Their influence on the photovoltaic market, and their ability to adapt to module price volatility to avoid too attractive profits, is analysed using weekly data. A theoretical model analysing the influence of firms' strategies on the incentive effect of feed-in tariffs allows us to give further recommendations concerning an optimal feed-in tariff scheme."
"De nouveaux produits et services jouissent aujourd'hui d'un succès surprenant, alors qu'ils ne s'intègrent pas dans les canons traditionnels de l'innovation. Sans proposer de ruptures technologiques ni d'usages clairement identifiés, ces biens suscitent toutefois une large exploration d'usages nouveaux et inconnus, à l'image du service web Twitter ou du téléphone iPhone qui viennent bouleverser les pratiques quotidiennes de leurs usagers dans de nombreux domaines, y compris professionnels.La littérature apporte des réponses partielles aux enjeux soulevés par cette classe de biens, mais semble limitée par une vision des biens comme systèmes de découplages de la conception d'usages : celle-ci aurait lieu au sein de la firme par des approches de type analyse d'usage ou bien auprès d'usagers-concepteurs très compétents.Nous proposons ici une théorie qui veut intégrer ces différents apports tout en soulevant les hypothèses que nous jugeons trop restrictives sur les usagers, les biens et leurs rapports à la conception d'usage. Ce projet nous amène à rediscuter de la notion de biens pour les considérer comme des espaces de conception d'usages, à destination d'acteurs à la fois usagers et concepteurs.Ce nouveau paradigme suppose en revanche de réinterroger le rôle de la firme dans l'organisation de cette action collective de conception d'usages. La confrontation de notre modèle théorique à trois études de cas révèle que les succès que l'on connait aujourd'hui reposent sur une organisation sophistiquée des relations entre la firme et ses usagers concepteurs, ainsi qu'une ingénierie spécifique de dispositifs de conception, de formation et de coordination."
"This thesis studies the role of third parties in tempering informational issues at stake with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR). Firms growingly claim to be adopting responsible practices, and it may be so because some socially conscious stakeholders (e.g. consumers, investors) are ready to reward such behaviors. Nevertheless, truthfulness of firms' virtue claims is often impossible or at least difficult to ascertain, which creates an incentive for firms to manipulate their communication. This dissertation intends to analyse how third parties can temper this asymmetry of information. Organisms such as rating agencies, non-governmental organisations, labeling institutions, can investigate firms' real actions and convey this information to stakeholders. These third parties have heterogeneous informational behaviors: some of them mostly disclose information on firms that do not behave responsibly while others are specialized in revealing firms that are socially or environmentally responsible. We develop a simple theoretical model that explores the provision of quality by a ﬁrm under friendly informational environments, in which quality is more often disclosed when it is high than when it is low, and hostile environments, in which the converse holds. We apply this base model to two types of third party: NGOs and labels. We endogenize the production of good and bad news in order to understand when and why NGOs choose between being hostile or friendly. Then, we seek to assess what is the more efﬁcient level of label's strictness to spur social welfare and investment in high quality."
"Many studies show that industrial design is key to triggering, fostering andsustaining innovation. However, the unique capacities of creation and innovationof industrial designers make it challenging for them to thrive within industrialenvironments.The challenge for companies is to create the optimal work environment forthose professionals, while ensuring their work can be integrated smoothly intothe existing industrial design processes. We assume this dilemma is partiallystemming from the intensive use of sequential design models in the industry.Design tools were developed on the assumption that creative front end andproduct development should be separated.We introduce here a new model, aiming at depicting accurately the reasoningmodes and the nature of the object being designed with the digital ComputerAided Design (CAD) suites. This model is the result of the joint mobilization offour academic fields : computer, cognitive and management science and designtheories. Dassault Systèmes and their CATIA software have proven to be an excellentresearch environment for such questions. As we have been thinking, thenew model (laminated) makes three new hypothesis. Those unheard assertionshave been suggested and validated with this thesis :1/ Some specific design workshops are able to provide simultaneously robust andgenerative design capacities. We call this characteristic «acquired originality».2/ The object representations within by the software are not the result of successiverefinements but derive directly from a parameterized set of rules.3/ Industrial designers have specific requirements for CAD tools, different fromtheir engineers and artists counterparts because what they design is fundamentallydifferent. IDs generate conceptual models using a mass singularity technique.Those results sketch the emergence of a new generation of CAD tools forindustrial designers and able to foster innovation."
"This project studies the making of a market for wind power in France. Markets for wind power are often referred to as ‘political markets: On the one hand, wind power has the potential to reduce CO2-emissions and thus stall the effects of electricity generation on climate change; and on the other hand, as an economic good, wind power is said to suffer from (techno-economic) ‘disabilities', such as high costs, fluctuating and unpredictable generation, etc. Therefore, because of its performance as a good, it is argued that the survival of wind power in the market is premised on different instruments, some of which I will refer to as ‘prosthetic devices'. This thesis inquires into two such prosthetic devices: The feed-in tariff and the wind power development zones (ZDE) as they are negotiated and practiced in France, and also the ways in which they affect the making of markets for wind power. Theoretically, this dissertation mobilizes a constructivist approach according to which markets are seen as socio-technical assemblages, stressing the heterogeneous and distributed character of their constituent elements. Furthermore, the approach allows questioning the deadlocked delineation between politics and economics, a delineation that appears to underlie the idea of the political market. Based on fieldwork in France, the core of this thesis is made up of two analyses; firstly, the definition of a feed-in tariff is empirically followed as a process of valuation in which value is seen as the outcome of irregular and costly activities, rather than the identification of an inherent value.To study how value, here in the form of a price, comes about in the case of wind power, five different empirical traces are followed with each one representing a distinct approach to valuation. These valuation proposals involve qualifying and disqualifying wind power, e.g., from CO2-reducing to CO2-emitting, and they span a range of controversies. The second analysis addresses the ZDE-device. It follows the device along two phases; namely, its conception and its emerging practice in a specific case, the territory of Pays de la Serre. The first phase is discussed as a politicization of wind power, a distinct framing of location in which the possibility for local opposition is enforced. The second phase, i.e. the practice of the device in Pays de la Serre, is better described as an economization of the landscape, a process of translating the territory according to one-dimensional layers. In their final presentation, these layers are accumulated and black-boxed, and the criteria for their construction disappear."
"Can a company organize development with controlled risk while promising markets and eligible technologies are yet unknown? These situations cannot be handled with classical techno push or market pull strategies; and ""trial and learning"" processes are too unpredictable and too costly while facing with unknowns in high-tech. However, in some industries such as semiconductors, one has to organize exploration while controlling costs and risks in double unknown. In this situation the success of technological development in double unknown is correlated with the existence of generic technologies. Though, it remains unclear how to account for the design of generic technologies. This thesis models the design of generic technologies and investigates the associated models of collective action.This work is based on four main results:1) an original model of risk management that consists of identifying “common unknown” for several potential applications; 2) the modeling and simulation defining the techno-economic conditions in which the introduced “common unknown” strategy is relevant; 3) The characterization of the notion of generic technological concepts and the process of genericity design built upon the most recent design theory formalisms ; 4) a new managerial figure, the «cross-application manager », essential for the success of generic technologies design."
"Algorithmic trading, designed for speculative purposes, really took off in the early 2000's, first for optimizing market orders based on human decisions and then for executing trading strategies in real time.  In this systematic trading approach, human intervention is limited to system supervision and maintenance. The field is growing even though the Efficient Market Hypothesis says that in an efficient market, speculation is futile.Human Computation is an unusual concept which considers human brains as a part of a much larger machine, with the power to tackle problems that are too big for today's computers. This concept is at the crossroads between two older ideas:  collective intelligence and crowdsourcing able to involve humans (whether they are paid or not, they realize it or not) in problem solving or to achieve a complex task. The Fold-it project in biochemistry proved the ability of a human community to set up an efficient collective intelligence system based on a serious online game.Algorithmic trading is on same difficulty level of complexity as the problem tackled by Fold-it's creators. In that case “human CPU” really helped in solving 3D puzzles. The question is whether Human Computation could be used in algorithmic trading even though there are no 3D structures or user-friendly puzzles to deal with.The first experiment in this thesis is based on the idea that information flows in social media may provide input to algorithmic trading systems based on Human Computation principles. Twitter, the micro blogging platform, was chosen in order to track (1) words that may have an impact of financial markets and (2) unexpected events such as the eruption of the Icelandic volcano. We demonstrate that a significant increase in P&L can be achieved in the second case by treating the unexpected events as alerts.The second experiment with Human Computation in algorithmic trading aims to get a community of internet users to optimize parameters of the trading strategies, in the way that the Fold-it game did. In this online game called “Krabott” solutions are presented as friendly virtual bots each containing a specific set of parameters for a particular trading strategy in its DNA. Humans who are playing the game, interact in the selection and reproduction steps for each new “Krabott”.In this game the Krabotts “bred” by players outperformed those resulting from a computer optimization process. We tested two different versions of Krabott during the years 2012 and 2013, and in both cases the population bred by the players outperformed the “computer only” ones. This suggests that it may be possible to set up a whole hybrid human-computer system based on Human Computation where each player is a kind of single CPU within a global trading system.The thesis concludes by discussing the types of competitive advantages that structures based on Human Computation have for data acquisition into a trading system or for optimizing the parameters of existing trading strategies. Going further we expect that in the years to come Human Computation will be able to set up and update algorithmic trading strategies, whose complexity exceeds what an individual person could comprehend."
"Experiments on sustainable city or neighborhood accompanied by the search for new modes of design, governance, management and plan-ning of the city.  The thesis proposes to study the emergence of an innovation based on so-called 'sustainable' from the tools and instruments which will equip participants to manage these new situations.    Four types of instrumentation are considered in the thesis: legal (contracts between the parties); Economic and Financial (financial engineering development projects / ACG), governance and management (repositories, project management and process) design and evaluation performance of the district or area con-sidered (these tools and templates that can be quantitative and qualitative). This systematic analysis has not yet been carried out in the literature. It is therefore a theoretical issue. It is also an empirical issue because design patterns are planning to conceive, a synoptic view is a key issue for actors, public or private, who wish to contribute to this new integrative function.  For this, the thesis is based on two approaches:  - A historical perspective of the logic of development to show the changes brought about by sustainability issues and challenges of this new feature;  - An empirical analysis and comparative depth of experience innova-tive in France and abroad.  Our goal is to answer two research questions: What are the instruments, collective reasoning and collective experiments that support in-novantes current in terms of sustainable management?  What are the attributes of the function of sustainable (parallel with the 'innovation function')?"
"How does work the fabric of management consulting's value? Despite the dynamism of the market, consultants' practice remains poorly known and often criticized. One questions the efficacy of their methods and the general value added of their recommendations. The intellectual tools of the pragmatist sociology allow us to shed a new light on these matters, getting around the classic opposition between a functionalist (rational-technical) and a critical (psycho-social) approach to the practice. The key argument of the dissertation is that management consulting should be understood as a performance geared toward a practical efficacy. Value emerges from the service as it is being performed: it sanctions the felicity of a socio-technical attachment between consultants and their client-system. The dissertation is grounded on a complete involvement in a large French consulting firm, for about three years. It is an ethnographic account of the practices of consultants during their assignments within various large organizations. It decrypts specifically five valuation processes that intensify the density and the impact of the service in client-systems: (1) the singularization of the service, (2) the rise in competence of consultants,(3) the production of their authority, (4) the graphical presentation of the diagnosis and (5) the signaling of activity. The empirical study of such mechanisms fuels a pragmatist theory of value as a practical attachment and allows us to better understand the stakes of contemporaneous capitalism."
"He current study explores the curiously not much studied in management problem of innovation of contemporary Web-based applications. Starting from the distinction between user (U) and manufacturer/entrepreneur (E) innovation and using a phenomenon-based research approach, it identifies a third actor, the developer (D), whose action is found to lie in-between the two. Three actor figures are proposed for his description: user-developer (UD), user-developer-entrepreneur (UDE) and developer- entrepreneur (DE).This interpretative framework (U, D, E) is tested in the second part on the cases of three industries, where it enables a tracing of their history, from their birth to their maturity: radio industry, PC industry and enterprise computer industry. The important role of D actor is identified in all three settings. Their development phases can be read as a sequence of innovations related to different actors, UDs, UDEs and DEs successively, until the proposition of a rationalisation by enterprises (Es) and leading to the independence of the three actors, U, D, E.During the intermediate maturity phase of the Web, where expert enterprises Es have appeared, yet the de- velopers Ds remain under the forms of DEs or UDEs, the question posed for enterprises is how to harness their activity for innovation. Three management modes are identified in the third part. The first method consists in fostering the self-revelation of these actors. The second consists in harnessing their action using ephemeral settings for the exploration of the potential of a given service. The last consists in animating a community of developers already using the enterprise's technology to encourage them in developing applications on the basis of this technology."

"Firms reduce their environmental impacts thanks to a series of environmental assessment tools such as LCA and Bilan Carbone (the latter being a specific form of carbon footprint assessment tool). which are supposed to act as decision support tools. However, even if these tools are widely spread among companies, the question of their performativity, or the way they effectively change managerial practice, remains. In other words several of these assessment tools do not become ipso facto management instruments. Research on environmental sciences link the difficulties of assessment tools appropriation to the tools' inherent properties (ergonomics, scientific models' robustness) and are subject to a to constant revision work. In this thesis, we explore the organisational and cognitive dimensions of this appropriation; in particular the emergence of epistemic and practice communities structured around the instruments, which constitute a receptive environment for their deployment.Based on a field work in an environmental consultancy agency, this thesis examines for six empirical case studies the process and the conditions under which the instruments trigger a sustained collective action. Beyond the basic instrument level, we study the features that are implemented in the course of collective actions and their unexpected effects. This research project highlights the existence of a variety elaborate devices, which affect firms learning capabilities. The characterisation of these devices helps identifying new managerial figures and intermediate communities, integrated to a greater or lesser extent to the company, playing a key role in the dynamics of collective action."
"As “cluster” became a new buzzword, governments around the world increasingly implement cluster policies. However, a relevance gap is growing between cluster research and practice. Scholars build theories about the roles of clusters as powerful entities fostering innovation and competitiveness. Meanwhile, governments and policy-driven cluster organizations struggle to manage these highly entangled objects. This thesis addresses such a relevance gap. A systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted on cluster policy research, which demonstrates that governments and policy-driven cluster managers constantly face a multitude of organizational dilemmas, i.e. a set of decisions and choices for which there is no “one best choice”, in matters such as how to implement cluster policy (political dilemmas), how to manage policy-driven cluster members (managerial dilemmas) and how to adapt the policy-driven cluster to the local reality (structural dilemmas). Answering these dilemmas is constitutive of the management of policy-driven clusters, but it generates side-effect pathologies that need to be monitored and evaluated. In this thesis, we conduct a qualitative empirical investigation of a French policy-driven cluster located in the Paris Region: we analyse in detail the organisational dilemmas and their related side-effect pathologies. Four different pathologies are identified: inefficiency (driven by leadership dilemmas), distrust (driven by subsidies dilemmas), non-conformity (driven by structural dilemmas), and pragmatism (driven by managing innovation and collaboration dilemmas). The deeper knowledge of these pathologies contributes to improve cluster policy implementation and cluster evaluations. Finally, this thesis argues that academics need to shift from studying the “anatomy of clusters” to studying the “pathology of clusters”."
"This thesis studies the role of construction costs and safety regulation on nuclear power competitiveness. The analysis of the construction costs is based on the use of the actual data coming from the american and french nuclear fleet. In particular, we study different channels from which cost reductions might arise. We show that standardization is a key criterion for the economic competitiveness of nuclear power, first because the positive learning effects are conditional to the technology, this means that cost reductions will arise only if the same type of reactor is built several times, but also because it allows to reduce the cost indirectly through shorter construction lead-times. In the analysis of the role of safety regulation, we first asses the effect of the latest major nuclear accident (i.e Fukushima Dai-ichi) in the probability of occurrence of such an event and then the effects of the uncertainty regarding how safety care reduce the probability of a nuclear accident in setting safety standards under moral hazard and limited liability. We find that the standard will be stricter when the regulator is optimistic in the safety care effectiveness to reduce the risk of an accident, but simultaneously this policy might induce no compliance of the most inefficient operators."
"Strategic spatial planning in France is currently given a rising importance for environmental and climate issues. But is this tool really able to reduce urban sprawl and to produce a efficient framework for reducing transport emissions? And what can be the potential contributions to planning of economic analysis and prospective modelling? To answer this, we developed our study on the contribution of economic tools to planning into the global political and administrative reforms of France. We then produced a critical analysis of current planning practices and recent evolutions, and try to define the conditions for a better integration of economic analysis into planning processes and methods. For our case study (Grenoble urban area) we built and used economic tools able to inform local climate policies in the framework of urban planning. It is the first implementation of the land -use transport interaction model TRANUS in France, which was linked to an original economic methodology in order to produce marginal abatment cost curves useful at the urban level. This model and the methodology can take into account the systemic nature of cities and then help to define better transport policies: we call this tool TRANUS+. To have a more complete view of the urban planning question and the way to improve it, we investigated several issues from the perspective of planning: the choice of modelling tool and the role of cost-benefit analysis, energy poverty in the transport sector, electric vehicle deployement."
"Internet intermediaries' liability is a rising issue in a more and more complex digital environment. Intermediaries provide online services. They create or facilitate transactions between third parties (hosting, online shops, ISPs...). At the end of the 1990s, a limited liability has been established for these actors with the aim of developing intermediaries and Internet through cross externalities. However, the arrivals of new uses and functions have created negative externalities for some economic agents. The new increase of case law sometimes contradictory, in particular for intellectual property rights, questions this exemption. It creates legal risk for Internet intermediaries. Thus, they have to take into account this new situation in their business models. This thesis studies specific behaviors that Internet intermediaries' liability creates with the example of intellectual property rights. First we describe the historic evolution of this liability. Then we develop a simple theoretical model in order to explore the influence of legal risk when there is competition between an intermediary and a copyright holder. Finally, the model is extended to take into account avoidance activities of Internet intermediaries."
"More and more organizations turn to collective activities to design new products, services, processes or public policies with users, employees, citizens and other stakeholders. As a result, we know how to organize collective innovation under several forms : generally for moderated innovation with actors who work well together, within collectives who also function well. Yet, before discussing interactions for the purpose of innovating, we must recognize that we do not always perceive how these creative collectives emerge. Little is known about the moment it emerges. We also denote an antagonism regarding the management of communities, which is often badly perceived and potentially fatal. But then again, how can one stay on the touchlines when all the proper conditions are not in place a priori and when everything remains to be built?Thus, we are faced with a double unknown: 1) on the emergence of the creative communities, and de facto 2) on the management of the emergence of these collectives. How can we manage without being intrusive in contexts where there is nothing? Can innovation be a resource in this process and not only an effect? If that is the case, then we must understand how and for which reasons. Yet, the literature tends to separate both dimensions. It discusses innovation, but often portrays it as if it was reserved for ""established"" collectives ; or, on the other side, it discusses collectives, but it does not show how innovation can help in their development. Rather, the thesis demonstrates that there is a strong link between communities (relations) and innovation (for we are dealing with creative communities). That engaging in innovation (to design) strengthens the collective and that the collective strengthens the capacity of to innovate.We argue that co-design deals preciscly with this question. That this type of design poses as a tremendous space for the creation of collectives, where other methods fail, and that it gives way to creative communities where collective action was the least expected. More precisely, the thesis adresses the following three questions: 1) What are the characteristics of the collectives and the contexts ""pre"" community? 2) What is the role of design in the emergence of creative communities?; and 3) How to manage creative communities on the long run? By a qualitative and constructivist approach, it mobilizes a range of methodologies: multiple cases study, modelling and experimentation, as well as intervention research.Axis I deals with unstructured interpersonal relationships and contexts of innovation even less fertile than anticipated. Nevertheless, these conflicting initial relationships give way to a collective capacity to explore the unknown by the fact of engaging in co-design. The first managerial act of the genesis of a creative community lies in the capacity to transform, through a collective design activity, conflicts in common ""undecidables"",  without solving them necessarily.Axis II demonstrates that the relational links strengthen as soon as actors engage in the generation of concepts; when they get to share and combine their knowledge in new ways. However, once this transformation has occured, communities need external resources to pursue their expansion. Thus, the second managerial act consists in putting back communities under tension by bringing in independent knowledge.Finally, the management of more elaborate and longer co-design initiatives in the third axis offers solutions to the various intra and inter sessions issues uncovered along the way. It also identifies two additional managerial acts: the consolidation of value and of the creative community, as well as the resolution collective proposals and the opening of new explorations."
"In a globalized world, unilateral environmental policies may fail to correct market failures from a global point of view. In this dissertation, I examine some mechanisms through which environmental regulations could lead to inefficient outcomes under free trade. I also investigate how particular environmental policies such as recycling policies can help to address other concerns at the country level. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I analyze how cross-country difference in waste taxes impacts the bilateral trade in waste between the member states of the European Union. I find that a higher asymmetry in the waste taxes is associated with a non negligible amount of waste exported from strict countries to lax countries. This result illustrates the harmful impact that ""race to the bottom"" behaviours can have under free trade. This result has important policy implications since these behaviours can lead to an insufficient internalization of the environmental damages caused by waste management activities. Recycling policies are implemented to reduce environmental impacts but they can also mitigate country dependence on foreign raw materials. In the second chapter, I find that recycling policies substantially reduce country dependence on foreign raw materials by stimulating domestic production of secondary raw materials. In the third chapter, I test empirically whether offshoring to low-production-cost countries reduces firms' propensity to innovate in clean technologies. I find that trade with low-cost countries may have significantly reduced green innovation in high production cost countries during the last decades. In the last chapter, I use micro-data on French manufacturing to test a major part of the assumptions made in the seminal work of Porter and van der Linde. I find evidence against the Porter Hypothesis although the negative impact of regulations on firm profitability is rather small. This is evidence of a necessary but not sufficient condition for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis."
"The dissertation studies how actors implement contemporary adjustments in listed buildings without disrupting their embodied Heritage. The listed building’s legitimacy relies on its authenticity whose respect by actors is essential to maintain the institutional protection, as it is the material representation, or instantiation, of the Listed-Buildings Institution. However, intervention works to change such an artifact lead to various debates among actors, as the majority of current listed buildings were not originally constructed to last, i.e. to be transmitted to future generations. One debate during intervention works tackles the issue of what needs to be or not to be considered in terms of Heritage. Through a constructivist grounded-theory methodology, the dissertation allows the understanding of how actors succeed in producing one unique outcome. I propose the instantiation construction process in which both symbolic but also material constructions are emphasised. And to do so, I intertwine Scandinavian Institutionalism and Collective Bricolage. Indeed, actors need first to design, with the help of the three institutional pillars, a shared interpretative frame to select relevant building materials. They could thus modify an existing building in regards to what building’s authenticity deserves to be respected. This frame acts in fact as a preliminary step to implement a simultaneous two-level dialogue enabling the materialisation of the intangible ideas: 1) between actors and the frame to test the material solutions actors suggest and 2) between each actors’ “resources at hand” repertoires by means of six selection criteria that help them to make decision on which material is relevant to use or not."
"The analysis of the phenomenon of consumer goods transformation based on the functional expansion of these goods over time, has mobilized and challenged various theoretical approaches, whether in management science, evolutionary economics or engineering design.This thesis proposes to assess the functional expansion of consumer goods, to understand whether the transformation of consumer goods is rare or rather permanent over time. Using a new measuring tool, first, we could reject the lancasterian hypothesis of stability of consumer goods over time, by showing that the transformation of consumer goods is permanent and that new functions emerge constantly over time. Then we have shown that the emergence of innovations is non-poissonian emergence and controlled, that it is not exclusively the result of an external shock from the design, but that innovation can tip regardless of market needs or new technologies, through innovative design efforts.Finally, the thesis examines the role of consumerist prescription in maintaining market dynamics over time. This dynamic requires the continuous learning of functional expansion by consumers. So we show how and why the prescription facilitates the learning process, which in turn ensures a permanent transformation of consumer goods, and implies a continuous dynamic between supply and demand."
"The evaluation of the costs and benefits of central banking is to a considerable degree dependent on the analytical approach pursued.Instrumentalist-positivist approaches, as discussed in the first part of the thesis, emphasize the importance of empirical-quantitativepredictions for the development of economic models. Within this line of research, there exists a strong emphasis on those consequences of central banking that have an immediate and readily measurable empirical counterpart in the observed economic environment.Hence, the beneficial short-term effects of expansionary monetary policy in terms of increased economic activity are studied in detail and are well understood by proponents of these approaches. Internal counterarguments are based on acknowledged ignorance about potentially destabilizing side-effects. The costs of central banking are essentially seen as welfare losses from decreasedeconomic activity or excessive price inflation as results of deviations from an optimal monetary policy path. The causal- realist approach, as studied in the second part, assigns a narrower role to quantitative-empirical tools of analysis. This line of research allows for a fruitful extension of the cost-benefit analysis to more abstract notions such as systemic risk and moral hazard that can be analyzed qualitatively. It is argued that modern central banking is a contributing factor to both. Moreover, business cycles and wealth redistribution from bottom to top as important effects of credit expansion are analyzed. An alternative explanation of stagflation based on the process of political interventionism in response to unintended consequences of monetary policy is proposed."

"Business networks are organizational forms that lead to a number of benefits for business members. For the latter, this organizational form has the advantage of not eliminating their autonomy or their independence, while benefiting from the advantages linked to inter-organizational reconciliations. In this way, the networks thus comprise two distinct but inseparable organizational levels : the organizational level of the member companies and the organizational level of the network. Before benefiting from the advantages of networking, it is necessary that it be built by the organizations that are at the origin of it. In time, the construction of the network leads to a certain strengthening of its degree of negentropy, resulting in a long-term complexification. This complexity takes place while preserving the autonomy and independence of the member organizations. Little attention has been paid to this question of network construction. This thesis proposes to answer it using a paradoxical approach (paradoxical approach and dialectical approach), which makes it possible to take into account the indissociability of the dual organizational level of networks. Through a case study applied to a network of companies in the horticultural sector of the Angevin region, we seek to identify how the objectives of each of the two organizational levels contribute to the construction of the network in question and to the reinforcement of its degree of negentropy."
"Despite the number of mergers and acquisitions (M&As), their high failure rate calls to continue research by proposing new reading keys. Many studies argue that M&As require new approaches to understand the organizational complexity and dynamism of these operations, and more specifically concerning post-merger integration (PMI) process. This phase is defined as a crucial one because it determines the success or failure of the merger. Our research provides an analysis of the dynamics inherent in the process, and especially during the PMI. This study is based on an integrative logic, considering the multiplicity of dynamics at work to understand how they engender or hinder the success of PMI. We use these dynamics as a means to capture the complexity inherent in the merger process, and as an opportunity to capture the dynamics of PMI. The concept of paradox allows us to make intelligible these inter-related dynamics within a defined temporal framework. Paradoxes provides a framework to decipher the dynamics inherent in organizations. The paradoxical reading allows a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics at work in the merger process. This leads us to ask the following research question: ""How does the management of paradoxes benefits post-merger integration? "". The thesis is based on a qualitative methodology of a longitudinal and real-time case study of a 24-month merger, once the operation has been signed. It emerges from the thesis that the evolutionary nature of paradoxes during the post-merger integration, as well as their multiplicity (categories, actors, levels), allows us to understand how these dynamics interfere in the success of the PMI process."
"In France, as in many countries, the last decades witnessed the dynamism and the spreading of metropolises, wich concentrate at the same time decision-making functions, productive high-added-value functions, as well as skilled populations, and benefit therefore from agglomeration economies. If the contribution of these metropolises to the national wealth is major, the phenomenon of metropolization tends to strengthen the territorial disparities. Supported by the recent territorial reforms, in particular the laws NOTRe and MAPTAM, the strenghtening of the role of regions, as well as their enlargement, and the metropolises affirmation raise keenly the issues of the territorial development, of the relevant action territories and of the wealth distribution within the regional space.The region Midi-Pyrénées doesn’t constitue an exception to this phenomenon of metropolization as the dynamism, the influence and the urban growth of Toulouse are significant. Furthermore, its subregional heterogeneousness offers a favourable field of reearch to identify the new territorial challenges involved by the metropolization : a growing polarization of activities, a differenciated demography , an economic growth restricted by the « tyranny of distance », skills and productivites are unevenly distributed, or even polycentric urban pattern.So, today, the territorial equity challenge can be met combining the strong impetus of the metropolises, with specific territorial dynamisms, and a relevant and cooperative territorial policy."
"The purpose of this thesis is to determine the presence of competitive advantages in Latin American Telecommunications markets. Most of major operators present in the region, including Telefónica and América Móvil, entered the market in favorable conditions when the industry was privatized in the early 1990s. In the past ten years markets have become more competitive due to changes inregulation. The analysis of the evolution of operators’ performances in this context allows to distinguish between those having actual competitive advantages and those having a strong market position thanks to their entry strategy. This thesis consists of five chapters. In chapters one and two we analyze the institutional context and the evolution of the telecommunications markets of each country. In chapter three, we determine that competition is characterized by facility-based entry in the three countries, which leads to disparities in terms of quality of service between operators. To determine if these disparities lead to competitive advantages, we test the presence of short and long-term relationships in the evolution of operators’ operating margins, and on stock market returns volatility. Our results indicate the presence of short term relationships in the evolution of operating margins, which suggests that differentiation is not strong enough to escape from competitive pressure. However, stock return volatility is higher among local operators than among multinational operators."
"In today’s global economy, where the entrepreneurial environment is defined as uncertain and turbulent, companies choses coopétition strategies to have advantage and performance. But, according to the specialized literature, if the advantage and the performance are highlighted to justify the relevance of the strategies of coopetition, the notion of opportunism of the partner is also widely invested and identified by research as a brake on coopetition. It is in this way that we can see in this literature two differentiated theses which goods the analyses on coopetition; a relationship between competitors, a source of exceptional performance and a fragile and unstable relationship at all times, on account of the supposed opportunism of the partner. The opportunism of the partner is particularly problematic in that it would lead to limiting the performance and advantages from expected coopetition.          The aim of the research is to establish a link between the performance of coopetition and social capital. Based on the opportunism of the partner, we have posited that the performance of a coopetition depends on two prerequisites: the reduction of opportunism and the increase in the commitment of the actors in relationships. Year empirical study is being carried out on the coopetition of very small mining companies of diamond in kasaï in Democratic Republic of Congo. A qualitative methodology allows the collection of data by semi direct interviews and the operation of the terms of speech using the lexicon metric tool “Iramuteq”. The objective is to identify the theoretically determined elements, which reflect either the stakes of coopétition for very small mining companies in a difficult environment or the relevance of social capital in the performance of coopetition. The link between the reduction of opportunism, the increase in commitment and the advantages of coopetition with social capital are the contribution of the research, contribution that concerns the knowledge both in management if coopetition, and relating to the very small mining companies of difficult context.          The key variable “opportunism” of the partner is the source of the link between the performance of coopetition and social capital. The logic followed us in response to the questions raised in the literature by different authors about the risk of opportunism that leads to the fragility and instability of coopetition. This allows us to formulate a virtuous model of the performance of coopetition through social capital. At the end of our empirical study, a discussion on managerial implications is conducted; leading to a specific form of coopetition invoicing two levels of network and recommendations are envisaged."
"Recognition at work is based on gratitude judgments in order to reward the good work performed by the employee and positively influences the discretionary behaviors that are not explicitly reward with formal compensation systems.This doctoral dissertation studies the relationship between recognition at work and discretionary behaviors, particularly the helping and innovative behavior.This research aims to find out by which means recognition at work affects helping behavior an innovative behavior. To do so, we suggested and exam this fundamental hypothesis that employee recognition at work has positive effect on both discretionary behaviors namely helping behavior and innovative behavior.We tested this hypothesis by conducting a qualitative study on a sample of 20 nurses that we have completed with a quantitative study conducted among a sample of 215 Tunisians nurses. The results of our study allowed us to identify the most explanatory forms of recognition of the helping behavior and innovation behavior.The results of our doctoral dissertation showed that nurses are constantly in search of recognition and they are looking to make their work more visible in order to ensure different forms of recognition, some of this forms have proved the most explanatory of both discretionary behaviors.Our research is innovative and contributes to study the employee recognition as a factor that promotes the adoption of helping behavior and innovative behavior."
"This dissertation examines the role of ownership structure in explaining capital structure and performance of European commercial banks from 2002 to 2010. It comprises three empirical essays. The first chapter explores the effect of greater control rights than cash-flow rights of an ultimate owner on the bank’s capital ratio adjustment and its lending decisions. The results show that whenever control rights exceed cash-flow rights, banks do not issue equity to increase their capital ratio and, instead, downsize by mainly slowing their lending. Chapter 2 provides evidence on how the divergence between control and cash-flow rights affects bank profitability and risk during normal times and distress times. The findings emphasize that during normal times the divergence between control and cash-flow rights is associated with lower profitability and higher risk. Conversely, during the acute financial crisis period (2007-2008), such a divergence improves profitability and banks’ resilience to shocks. The third chapter takes into account differences in the strength of ownership network to which banks belong when assessing the effect of greater activity diversification on bank performance. The results show that diseconomies of diversification vanish the stronger is the ownership network surrounding the bank in the control chain. Such mitigating roles are attributable to the presence of domestic and foreign institutional owners in the pyramid."
"This dissertation is composed of three chapters. The first chapter analyzes the impact of ownership structure and the reforms implemented in the mid 2000's on the efficiency of commercial banks in Vietnam. The results show that the efficiency differs depending on ownership type; state-owned banks have the lowest efficiency levels in comparison with private banks and banks with foreign shareholders. Since the implementation of more stringent minimum capital rules, bank capitalization has also been an important driver of bank efficiency. The second chapter discusses how banks in Vietnam set their interest margins with a particular focus on bank ownership and interest rate regulation by the central bank. The results show that only private and state-owned banks transfer their operational costs to their clients. Bank capitalization which reflects bank risk aversion is a significant determinant for foreign and state owned banks only in presence of interest rate regulation; these banks tend to pass the high capital cost to customers. We also show that, in absence of interest rate control, foreign banks set higher margins when they take higher credit risk while in presence of interest rate regulation private banks cope with higher credit risk without being able to raise their margin accordingly. The last chapter investigates the impact of monetary policy and economic conditions on bank lending for different levels of bank capitalization. The results indicate that all types of monetary policy shocks have a negative effect on lending but that an increase in bank liquidity leads to a lower reduction in loan growth. Finally, banks with lower capitalization are less influenced by the business cycle."
"This dissertation aims first to investigate whether banks, which have unique characteristics, use dividends to reduce the agency conflicts between their different stakeholders. Another objective is to investigate if the implementation of a regulation of dividend policy is necessary to oblige firms to pay dividends for good governance purposes. In Chapter 1, we examine if bank managers use dividends to reduce agency cost of equity (managers vs. shareholders) and agency cost of debt (shareholders vs. creditors). We show that bank managers use dividends as substitute to weak legal protection and strike a balance in their dividend policy with however a more decisive role played by the agency cost of equity than the one of debt. Chapter 2 further explores if the degree of ownership concentration and the level of asymmetric information (opacity) faced by outsiders influence banks’ dividend payouts. In either concentrated or dispersed ownership structure insiders (managers or majority shareholders) pay lower dividends when the degree of opacity is high. In line with the entrenchment behavior for banks, insiders extract higher levels of private benefits when it might be more difficult to detect such opportunistic behavior. Higher level of shareholder protection and stronger supervisory regimes help to constrain such behavior. These findings have critical policy implications for the implementation of Basel 3 with restrictions on dividend payouts that might reinforce this entrenchment behavior. In the Chapter 3, we investigate if the implementation of a regulation to oblige firms to pay dividends for better governance is desirable. We consider the case of Indonesia, where the regulator plans to implement a mandatory regulation on dividends in a context of declining dividend payments and weak shareholder rights. The findings recommend that firms should only be required to pay dividends when they reach a certain development stage, and action should only be taken against those firms which do not pay dividends, although they should be able to. Overall, dividend policies should not be regulated by one-policy-for-all regulation."
"This dissertation studies the impact of banks’ stress tests on the different market players. The first chapter analyzes how stockholders and bondholders react to the information disclosed in the financial market during crisis periods. We consider the 2011 EBA stress test as it discloses detailed information about banks and it is conducted during the European sovereign debt crisis. We use an event study methodology and find that stockholders’ reaction is more specific to the information disclosed, while bondholders have generally macro reaction and are more sensible to the financial crisis. However, when we go further in our analysis by considering the different categories of bonds, we find that the behavior of subordinated bondholders  tends  to  be  closer  to  the  behavior  of  stockholders.  This  specific  reaction  of  stockholders  during  financial distress may make them more susceptible to impose market discipline when there is a financial crisis. In a second chapter, we consider European and US banks’ stress tests to analyze the information value of the stress tests using stock market prices. We investigate if the stock market reactions to the stress test results are different according tothe  degree  of  opacity  of  banks.  We  find  that  the  stock  market  reacts  significantly  to  the  disclosure  of  the  stress  tests’ results  on the  whole  banks  (tested  and  non-tested) meaning  that  the stress test transparency  has  an  impact not only  on tested banks but also on banks that do not participated to the stress test. By separating the sample of banks in less opaque and highly opaque banks, we find a non-linear relation between opacity and market reaction.  The  third  chapter  of  this  thesis  investigates  the  impact  of  the disclosure  of  the  stress  tests  results  on  the  credit  rating agencies’ split ratings on bonds issued by banks. To calculate the split rating variable, we consider bonds jointly rated by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s and issued by banks that participated to the European and US banks’ stress tests. The analysis of the split ratings on the period before and after each stress test results disclosure in Europe and in the US shows that  the  stress  tests  have  mixed  effect  on  credit  rating  agencies.  Market  participants  could  interpret  the  detailed  data disclosed by the stress tests differently and these different interpretations may create more disagreements. However, we remark that in periods of distress i.e. during the European sovereign debt crisis, because of the high information need and the greater uncertainty, the stress tests results disclosure tends to decrease the split ratings."
"This thesis examines three important issues in the banking sector, namely: Risk, Capital and Lending. It comprises of three empirical essays. The first chapter analyzes the impact of the 'Arab Spring' and the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 on the banking sector stability in the MENA region. The results show that the ‘Arab Spring’ did not have a negative effect on banks’ stability, while the Global Financial Crisis significantly decreased banks’ stability. The second chapter investigates the role played by the institutional environment in determining capital buffers set either by regulators or by banks internally. The findings provide evidence that for the regulatory capital ratios to be effective, the institutional environment should not be neglected when implementing these ratios. The third chapter investigates the different effects of both consumers’ and creditors’ rights on the cost of lending. The results reveal that the cost of lending increases in the presence of strong financial consumer protection laws, while higher creditors’ rights decrease this cost."
"In the context of the human resources for health crisis, the development of healthcare professionals’ loyalty is an important challenge for healthcare organizations in the Sub-Saharan African Region. To overcome the crisis, the existing researches have suggested the relevance of focusing on and developing adequate HR policies (Lucas, 2005). Thus, our study examines the influence that HRM practices perceptions and the organizational context’s factors might have on employees’ loyalty toward their organization. The social exchange theory (Blau, 1964) was mobilized and two studies were undertaken. First, 27 semi-structured interview were conducted in the qualitative phase and data were analyzed using NVIVO 11 software. A questionnaire was then designed and filled in by a sample of 225 physicians; data were analyzed using SPSS 23 and AMOS 23 software. The main results reveal firstly, the existence of the direct positive effects of HRM practices on the perceived organizational support (POS) and on the perceived procedural justice, both affect positively the affective commitment and negatively the voluntary leaving intention. It can be concluded that the physician’s individual performance is neither associated with their perceived organizational support (POS) nor with their perceived procedural justice, at the other hand. The respondents indicate that internal organizational context’s factors (the satisfaction towards the hospital’s work equipment, the satisfaction towards the physical working environment) influence positively the perceived organizational support (1), are associated to their affective commitment and their voluntary leaving intention (2) and that the external context’s factors (the satisfaction towards the healthcare access of the population visiting public hospitals and the physicians’ satisfaction towards the socioeconomic living conditions) are associated to the voluntary leaving intention of the doctors (3). Finally, the tests of the indirect effects based on bootstrap analysis (Preacher & Hayes, 2008; Hayes, 2013) reveal that the effects the career management practices have on the affective commitment are mediated by the POS as well as by the perceived procedural justice (1) whereas the POS mediates the effects the reward practices and the internal organizational context’s factors have on the affective commitment and the voluntary leaving intention (2)."
"This research attempts to clarify the ongoing debate over indirect cost allocation, evaluate the attitude of the companies confronted with the allocation issue and analyze the types of discourse surrounding it. Here, we ask the following question: does an allocation technique intrinsically better than others exist? Actually, what really counts it is not the allocation technique (or method), but its meaning, emerging both from practice and discourse. It is thus necessary to adopt a different perspective on cost allocation, i.e. to stop reasoning in terms of methods, but rather seek to understand this phenomenon as a dated and contingent deliberation. We defend the idea that cost allocation constitutes a process (or an organisational phenomenon) carrying multiple meanings. These meanings emerge from the dialectics between practice and discourse, which actually hides the intervention of three categories of actors: companies, scientists and consultants. Under these conditions, not only an allocation technique intrinsically better than the others does not exist, but it is impossible even to conceive and define such a technique."
"This dissertation investigates the economic mechanisms underlying the transition to clean technologies and examines policy approaches to achieve the socially optimal path. It studies various policy measures aiming to deal with climate change, such as adaptation and taxation of non-renewable resources. Furthermore, it examines the policy instruments that target increasing the use of efficient technologies and identifies cases in which the policy reaches its objectives or not. It also analyzes the role of heterogeneity in society on agents' willingness to support a pollution tax. The first chapter studies the energy transition by using an optimal growth model in which non-renewable and renewable natural resources are imperfect substitutes in providing energy services necessary for production. The second chapter studies the role of adaptation policy on the transition to a low­ carbon economy. lt incorporates adaptation policy into the problem of optimal non-renewable resource extraction with pollution externalities, by focusing on the capital nature of adaptation measures. The third chapter focuses on the problem of adopting new technologies in a micro-economic framework. lt studies the behavior of firms when they face a decision to invest either in a cheap but inefficient production capacity or in an expensive but efficient one, by taking into account the presence of a financial constraint. The fourth and last chapter investigates the distributional impacts of a pollution tax by considering a society in which wealth is distributed heterogeneously among households."
"This thesis examines the determinants of foreign banks’ presence and their organizational strategies abroad and tests how such internationalization affects bank performance and systemic risk. The dissertation is comprises of three empirical essays on European banks. The first chapter analyzes whether differences in economic development of the host countries and the maturity of their financial system are relevant to explain how banking regulation affects the choice of the foreign location and the organizational strategy of an exclusive organizational network with only branches or subsidiaries or a mix model with both affiliates’ types. The findings indicate that over the 2011–2013 period, European banks prefer high-income countries with numerous activity restrictions and weaker supervision but less developed countries with less restrictions and stronger supervision. Regarding the choice of foreign organizational form, banks rather operate subsidiaries in high and middle-income countries with stringent entry requirements but prefer branches in developing countries with stringent capital requirements and greater supervisory power. However, banks always tend to avoid locations with stronger capital regulation than at home. Yet when they are present in such countries, they operate branches. The second chapter investigates how foreign organizational and geographic complexity affect the parent bank’s individual risk and profitability. Our results show that being present abroad is beneficial for bank stability as it contributes to lower default risk. Banks present abroad through both subsidiaries and branches appear to be more stable than banks present under one form only. Being present with branches only is the most effective way to reduce risk-taking. Nevertheless, higher geographic dispersion of affiliates around different world regions is associated with higher volatility of earnings and higher profitability. Chapter 3 considers the state and soundness of the banking system and examines whether the presence of banks abroad with subsidiaries affects bank systemic risk differently during calm period (2005–2007), distress times of the global financial crisis and the European Sovereign debt crisis (2008–2011), and years after (2012–2013). We show for European listed banks that operating subsidiaries abroad is associated with lower systemic risk in normal times. However, when the banking system is facing severe shocks, such internationalization produces on systemic risk reversed and negative effects that are long-lived and aggravated in the years after the crises. Our findings suggest that bank internationalization and foreign complexity are important for greater stability in normal times but turn out to increase instability during years of financial turmoil and in the aftermath."
"This dissertation highlights three important issues in Islamic banks. In the first chapter, we investigate the impact of dual market competition on the differences in deposit rate setting in Islamic and conventional banks. We show that there are notable differences in the determinants of deposit rates in the two types of institution. Market competition has a significant impact on deposit rate of conventional banks but not Islamic banks. Our result, in general, suggests that although Islamic banks’ deposit seems to be similar than conventional banks, their determinants are different. In the second chapter, we continue our investigations by looking at the competition-stability issue. Does competition between Islamic and conventional banks increase banks’ stability or fragility? Our main finding suggests that competitive dual banking market is not beneficial for banks’ stability. In line with the result from the first chapter, in the next investigation, dual market competition only matters for conventional banks. In the third chapter of this dissertation, we analyze the role of Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) on banks’ equity financing. Our result shows that Islamic banks’ equity financing is influenced by some characteristics of SSB. The presence of SSB member in the Board of Directors (BOD) or executive member has a positive impact on equity financing whereas the existence of a Shariah department in Islamic banks decreases the proportion of equity financing."
"We study the relationship between policy instruments, innovations through Research andDevelopment (R&D) and technology diffusion in a North-South structure. First, we analyze the impactof the implementation of policy instruments by a Northern country on domestic (process and product)R&D expenditures in a theoretical framework. The North faces competition from a low-cost Southerncountry. The results show that policy instruments increase R&D expenditures except for an importquota. Then, we focus on the issue of technology diffusion from the North to the South. We design adynamic theoretical model in which the North files a patent to increase the monopoly period with anew technology. Previous policy instruments slow down technology diffusion except for an importquota again. Nevertheless, retaliations implemented by the South may accelerate it. Finally, we makean empirical study through econometric estimations of potential determinants of the technologydiffusion from the North to the South measured by patent collaborations. We show that the EuropeanUnion integration of Eastern European countries significantly increases the intensity of patentcollaborations with Western European countries while the effect on the probability of collaboration isnot significant."
"Institutions, and their underlying rules, are essential for economic development, in that they provide a framework for markets to operate. However, different types of regulatory roles and even institutional settings may have very different effects on outcomes at the firm or individual level. This dissertation examines the effect of several types of rules and institutions on productivity and related measures. The first chapter examines the effect of international competition and domestic competitive barriers on firm-level productivity growth in the OECD. A close interaction is observed between import penetration and domestic barriers to entry, conditional on a firm's distance to the technological frontier. The second chapter examines the effects of labor market reform on plants in different Indian states. A positive effect of labor market reform is found on plant-level productivity growth in labor-intensive and volatile industries. The third chapter looks at Indian exporters who took advantage of capital account liberalization to invest abroad, and explores whether they gained through learning-by-doing. After matching these firms with similar firms that did not invest abroad, the chapter finds that productivity was not boosted, though firms did gain in terms of their overall size through market access. The fourth chapter explores how the legal system in different Mexican states has impacted the size of firms through heightened capital intensity. States with higher quality legal institutions are found to have systematically larger and more productive firms."
"The aim of this research is to consider the relevance of a CSR strategy towards territories for a multinational corporation.Through a pluridisciplinary literature review, we build a model to interpret social actions towards territories. We investigate empirically social actions of French Multinational corporations. Firstly, we analyse the content of thirty-eight French multinationals’ reports. Then, we interpret multinationals social actions through twelve case studies. One result of this research is a strategic differentiation of social actions by Multinational corporations depending on the territories. We find that Multinational corporations differentiate their social actions, or focus on specific territories. This research shows also therole of public actor and different stakeholders in the choice of social actions."
"For local authorities, real estate management has become a growing concern due to a changing environment. Consequently, for the past few years, local public organizations have tried to bring about some change in the way they manage real estate. In that sense, this study aims at proposing a framework for the analysis of the innovation of the local public real estate management by relying on conceptual elements. Then, through a quantitative and qualitative methodology, we analyse the relevance of the theoretical and conceptual models to describe the real estate management innovations implemented by local authorities. In the end, we observe the necessity of the evolution of local practices that are considered too elementary."
"This dissertation is divided in two sections. The first section addresses the question of the consequences of fiscal policy interventions on the economy and the second section analyzes the issue of the liquidity of European Government bonds during the recent financial crisis, the effect ofliquidity shock on these securities and consequences ofpolicy responses. The frrst chapter studies the impact of a discretionary government spending shock on economic activity and other macroeconomic variables by using an alternative two-step procedure for the identification of the govemment spending shock. The second chapter analyzes the effects of a combination of fiscal and monetary policy shocks on macroeconomic and financial variables using a Time Varying Parameters Factor Augmented VAR (TVP-FA VAR) mode!. The third chapter investigates the European market of repurchase agreements and shows that government bonds represent a key fraction of the collateral in these transactions. lt also examines the effects of a rise in haircuts on the value of govemment bonds and shows that this mechanism may represent a channel in the transmission mechanism of banking and sovereign-debt crises in the periphery of the Eurozone. Following the empirical findings of the third chapter, the last chapter proposes a DSGE model with financial frictions to assess the impact of a negative liquidity shock and the consequences ofunconventional policy."
"This thesis contributes to the growing economic literature on noncognitive skills that are critical for life success, specially for academic success. It comprises four essays based on behavioral and experimental economics approaches, with two main objectives. The first objective is to study two noncognitive skills, namely self-confidence and creativity. We aim at understanding the determinants of self-confidence, and the impact of creative potential on economic outcomes. The second objective is to study how school systems impact educational decisions, educational outcomes and intergenerational mobility, where noncognitive skills may play an important role, specially self-confidence and motivation. We observe an important impact of the noncognitive abilities on behavior and economic results, especially for the educational achievements. Taken all our evidences together, it seems fundamental that schools worry about the development of these noncognitive abilities - and not only of the cognitive abilities. Helping students to have better estimates of self-confidence, favoring the development of creative potential, and stimulating motivation and effort should be part of the education that pupils receive in schools ; promoting then better decisions, better outcomes and a more equitable society."
"The comparison between France and the United States shows how the inequalities in terms of employment conditions between descendants of immigrants and of native-born persons differ.This thesis proposes an empirical and comparative analysis of the employment conditions of immigrants’ offspring in France and in the United States. The goal is to better characterise the labour market integration of immigrants’ offspring, taking a multidimensional approach. The comparison between France and the United States highlight the dimensions of inequalities in terms of employment conditions between the descendants of immigrants and of native-born in each of country, henceforth improving the characterisation of these inequalities. Our analysis explores overeducation in a first chapter, in a second chapter, three aspects of the socio-economic security of job quality and in a final chapter, the distribution of wage differentials. Although differences in terms of employment conditions exist in both countries to the detriment of immigrants’ offspring, these differences do not appear to be the result of inequalities but rather of structural effects such as differences in age or education level between the two groups. The occupations and sectors of activity in which descendants of immigrants work also explain these differences. The results show similarities between the two countries. Once the selection bias to access employment is taken into account, having immigrant parents has no significant effect on overeducation (chapter 1) but a positive and significant effect on wages (chapter 2). On the other hand, the two countries differ on several points. In France, having immigrant parents significantly restricts the access to employment and lowers job security. However, in the United States, there is a negative effect only on working time (chapter 2). This thesis advocates for the consideration of the heterogeneity that exists within the population immigrants’ offspring, according to their parents’country of origin. Indeed, contradictory effects according to the parents’ country of origin may lead to non-significant effects at the aggregate level, as is the case for overeducation, for example. The final chapter shows a wider wage gap for low-wage workers in the two countries. Nevertheless, the major difference between the two countries is that the unobservable component contributes to narrowing the wage gap between natives and of immigrants but to increasing it in France."
"In this dissertation, I contribute to the thriving empirical literature in international trade by looking specifically at the international fragmentation of production and non-traditional trade costs. In chapter 1, using the new features of global input-output tables, I quantify the impact of the recent changes in foreign input use on the factor content of trade. I found that the changes in the factor content of trade are driven by each country position in the global supply chains. The chapter 2 analyzes the links between political relations and trade in light of the growing interdependency between countries. In this joint work with Julian Hinz, using a new proxy fora negative shock to political relations between countries, we show that the impact of such a negative shock is crucially heterogeneous across traded goods. Finally, in chapter 3 co-authored with Julian Hinz, we introduce a new measure for spoken languages based on Twitter data. We then use this measure to evaluate the effect of changes in language diversity on trade and real income in different locations in Europe."
"This thesis contributes to the literature on protests, women’s labor force participation and return migration. The first chapter examines the effects of the 2011 Egyptian protests on the relative labor market conditions of women using panel data from before and after the protests. Using Difference-in-Differences approach and a unique dataset on the Egyptian “martyrs"", the results suggest that the 2011 protests have reduced intra-household differences in labor force participation between husband and wife, through an added-worker effect. The second chapter examines whether temporary international migration enables returnees to climb the occupational ladder compared to non-migrants. Using an instrumental variable approach, Difference-in-Differences and Difference-in-Differences matching techniques, the results suggest that return migration increases the probability of upward occupational mobility, in particular for returnees who belong to the upper end of the educational distribution. The third chapter examines the effects of the first and second waves of Egyptian protests, on voting outcomes during Egypt’s first free presidential elections. The main finding of this chapter is that higher exposure to protests’ intensity leads to a higher share of votes for former regime candidates, both during the first and second rounds of Egypt’s first presidential elections after the uprisings. Results also suggest that the protests led to a conservative backlash, alongside negative economic expectations, general dissatisfaction with government performance, decreasing levels of trust towards public institutions, and increasing recognition of limitations on civil and political liberties."
"The present thesis proposes a theoretical and empirical study of the determinants of the pricing of public services and their conditions of effectiveness. Taking into account environmental and social issues, the deployment of smart grids and the strong constraint on cost control have led to the implementation of new pricing and organizational practices in public services. This thesis proposes three essays devoted to the impact of these new practices in drinking water in France. First, we analyze the transition from an affine tariff to a progressive tariff on the behavior of consumers of drinking water, starting from a natural experiment conducted in Dunkerque. A first result indicates that demand has decreased with this new tariff, while creating distortions. A second result indicates that the consumer reaction to the price signal has been ambivalent. This work suggests to rethink the tariff design and the accompaniment of the consumers in their choices to limit the cognitive biases. In a second step, we analyze how the local political organization (in France, the level of the single municipality, the union of communes (Syndicats) or super-municipality (communauté de communes) and the management mode (public or private) can influence the performance of the public service. The impact of these organizational configurations on costs has never been studied simultaneously by the literature. We first propose a theoretical model to analyze them together. Then, from a panel of French water services, we observe empirically that these different organizational combinations have an impact on the price."
"The financial globalization for the past decades witnesses the global imbalance phenomenon on which the deficit current accounts by some large advanced economics are continuously financed by some developing economies with the high output growth rates and the scarce capital stocks. On the theoretical ground, the Neo-Classical growth model implies that one economy with scarcity of capital would have a high marginal product of capital and a high autarky interest rate therefore, at the integration with the free mobile capital, that country would experience the net total capital inflows so that the domestic interest rate equals that to the rest of world’s rate (Lucas 1990). Furthermore, one economy growing faster than the rest of the world would also have a higher investment demand and should experience the inflows of net total capitals (Gourinchas and Jeanne 2015). The global imbalances are the result of the heterogeneity in the patterns of savings and investments across countries. Indeed, one country experiences an inflow of capital if its saving is less that its investment: that country borrows from the rest of the world to finance the excess investment demand. Similarly, one country would lend to the rest of the world if its saving is higher than its investment. The thesis would employ the productivity growth to shed the refresh lights on this heterogeneity across countries. [...]"
"This thesis consists of four chapters that examine various aspects of economic policy in its relation to globalization and economic integration. The first chapter considers the question of the link between trade specialization and growth. The results identify a robust empirical ink between initial level of sophistication at province level and real GOP per capita growth in the case of China. The second chapter examines the relationship between the structure of the Chinese banking system and the structure of exports. The empirical study reveals the presence of credit constraints weighing on domestic private firms, which export relatively less in sectors more dependent on external financing. The third chapter examines the impact of immigration on labor markets in a setting with fragmented regional markets. It shows that in this framework, the spatial mobility of migrant workers contributes to increase the efficiency of labor markets, but immigration policy becomes more restrictive under certain conditions. The fourth chapter examines the determinants of preferential free trade agreements. It shows that the gains in market access are a stronger determinant of a country's probability of signing an agreement than the gains accruing to consumers in the form of lower prices"
"This thesis is dedicated to the study of a particular class of non-linear Dynamic Factor Models, the Dynamic Factor Models with Markov Switching (MS-DFM). Combining the features of the Dynamic Factor model and the Markov Switching model, i.e. the ability to aggregate massive amounts of information and to track recurring processes, this framework has proved to be a very useful and convenient instrument in many applications, the most important of them being the analysis of business cycles.In order to monitor the health of an economy and to evaluate policy results, the knowledge of the currentstate of the business cycle is essential. However, it is not easy to determine since there is no commonly accepted dataset and method to identify turning points, and the official institutions announce a newturning point, in countries where such practice exists, with a structural delay of several months. The MS-DFM is able to resolve these issues by providing estimates of the current state of the economy in a timely, transparent and replicable manner on the basis of the common component of macroeconomic indicators characterizing the real sector. The thesis contributes to the vast literature in this area in three directions. In Chapter 3, I compare the two popular estimation techniques of the MS-DFM, the one-step and the two-step methods, and apply them to the French data to obtain the business cycle turning point chronology. In Chapter 4, on the basis of Monte Carlo simulations, I study the consistency of the estimators of the preferred technique -the two-step estimation method, and analyze their behavior in small samples. In Chapter 5, I extend the MS-DFM and suggest the Dynamical Influence MS-DFM, which allows to evaluate the contribution of the financial sector to the dynamics of the business cycle and vice versa, taking into consideration that the interaction between them can be dynamic."
"This thesis contributes to the diachronic and synchronic analysis of the linksbetween the forms of capitalism and their environment. The first chapter proposes to highlightthe manner in which the coevolution between capitalism and the environment was carried outby crossing the theoretical and empirical contributions of the régulation school withenvironmental history and ecological economics studies. We reveal that the differenthistorical forms of capitalism have led to extensive and differentiated environmentalconsequences. Conversely, it turns out that the relationship with the environment has had amajor influence on the forms of capitalism, especially through institutional environmentaldevices (EID). The second chapter aims at deciphering in which extent these devices undergoa process of differentiated adoption depending on the contemporary forms of capitalismwithin which they take place. In this framework, some degree of correlation appears betweenour EID based typology of countries and the typology of capitalism. Finally, the third chapterfocuses on how levels of inequality, which are largely dependent on different forms ofcapitalism, can influence the adoption of EID. By means of an econometric analysis, weattempt to determine which mechanisms are most likely to explain this phenomenon."
"Abalone aquaculture (Haliotis spp.) or halioticulture provides a good case study of the technical, social and environmental challenges of introducing newly domesticated marine organisms into the market. Abalone farming began in Japan in the 1960s and, according to FAO (2012), is now one of the most dynamic aquaculture industries in the world. Yet all attempts have not met with the same success. This essay aims to understand the factors that have allowed or hindered the environmental, social and technical success of halioticulture, with an emphasis on France.More specifically, we examine three main categories of factors that may explain its evolution:- The importance of socio-ecological factors in the management of abalone resource.- Socio-cultural factors that support the status of the abalone as an eligible resource for aquaculture.- The role of science in the industrialization of abalone farming."
"This thesis retraces the intellectual history of ordoliberalism, focusing in particular on the works of Walter Eucken and Wilhelm Röpke, with references to the contributions of Franz Böhm, Alexander Rüstow, Leonhard Miksch and Friedrich Lutz. The main question it addresses is the following: how can we explain the fact that ordoliberal thought had the intellectual resources to weight on German post-war reconstruction? In order to answer it, it is necessary to provide a clear definition of ordoliberalism in its discursive context. First the thesis shows that ordoliberalism, in its epistemological (Chap. 1 ), theoretical (Chap. 2), ideological (Chap. 3) and political (Chap. 4) components, can be defined as a political economy of power, i. e. a form of economic knowledge, whose primary objective is to analyse the sources, the action and the impact of power within society; in other words, as a specific doctrine rather than a sub-species of (neo) liberalism. Secondly, the thesis illustrates how this identity played a positive role in promoting a form of political rationality in the post-war years in West Germany (Chap. 5), but also a negative one by excluding rival political programs, such as that of John Maynard Keynes (Chap. 6). Finally, the thesis investigates the ordoliberal discourse as a benchmark for German, and then European, economic policies: a persistence that went together with its radical transformation from the initial political economy of power, to the contemporary form of ordoliberal orthodoxy."
"This thesis focuses on the nexus between climate change policy, international trade and competitiveness for energy-intensive trade-exposed industries (EITEs). In particular, it explores the question: Can climate policy be designed such that policy makers can do away with the concern that any serious attempt to decarbonise EITE sectors will lead to perverse results of offshoring of EITE production and emissions – a phenomenon known as “carbon leakage”? The thesis approaches this question by drawingin particular on the 10 years of experience of the EU with carbon pricing as the dominant tool for decarbonising EITE sectors. This is done in two steps. Firstly, by empirically evaluating existing EU policy solutions and asking whether the policies ultimately meet basic criteria for environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and policy coherence with respect to the long-term goals of EU climate mitigation. A number of important policy gaps and incoherencies are identified in this way that are of themselves interesting and of relevant to current policy settings. Secondly, this thesis takes a step back and questions and ultimately challenges the idea that the overarching policy framework of the EU– in particular the dominant role of the EU ETS carbon market – is sufficient for decarbonising these sectors in the longer term."
"The aim of this PhD dissertation is to examine both the supply and demand sideof financial inclusion. This research presents a comprehensive set of evidence regarding financial access at macro and micro levels. This thesis blends three essays where the third chapter provides insights on the crucial linkages between new technologies, financial inclusion and poverty. Findings have shown poverty and inequality reducing effects of financial inclusion based on cross country data. Moreover, it shows beneficial effects of new technologies in expansion of financial inclusion and poverty reduction. Fourth chapter argues that financial literacy is an important determinant of households’ financial inclusion and welfare. Based on primary data it further suggests that the access toand use of new technologies increase the likelihood of financial inclusion. The objective of fifth chapter is to determine whether the adoption of new technologies promotes financial inclusion for SMEs in Pakistan. The analysis indicates the association between information and communication technologies (ICT) adoption and firm’s access to finance,implying that firms with greater access to and use of new technologies are more likely to benefit from financial markets compared with the others. This research contributes to the literature on access to finance in a more extensive way by examining relatively modern dimensions such as ICTs, digital finance and mobile money. Moreover, this dissertation concentrates on the effects of financial development and ICT on poverty and inequality which is understudied branch in conventional finance-growth nexus."
"This dissertation aims to carry out a quantitative and qualitative analysis of wage employment in the sector of services to individuals by using individual data. The introduction and the first chapter describe the sector of services to individual and the economic and social issues. In the three subsequent chapters it presents three microeconometric trials.In chapter two, we present intrinsic motivation of employees in authorised organizations for services to individua (OASP), depending on whether the organization is for-profit or non-profit. This motivation is mainly focused among workers erning a gross salary above 1.6 times the minimum wage. ln chapter 3, the study of the factors that determine the transitions of employees to steady employment highlights that these factors affect those employees differently according to the characteristics of their work, especially the multi-active and mono-active feature. Finally, chapter 4 consists of evaluating the reduction policy of 15 points in employers' social security contributions favoring individual employers who report the actual wages. This public policy positively affects domestic employment. In terms of methodology, this dissertation implements three different econometric models: a switching model regression (chapter 2), a competing risks model (chapter 3), and, finally, the classical method of differences-in-differences (chapter 4)."
"This research was motivated by a general concern to enlarge the debate on the cultural sector’s role in development, recognizing that the current economic and monetary debate is inadequate to understanding the externalities attached to culture and the arts and to formulate policies accordingly. In order to broaden the debate into other social and intangible dimensions, a thorough literature review on social impact assessment studies inside the cultural sector was conducted. The review proved that these studies have been more oriented towards understanding the individual extrinsic impacts of engagement in cultural practices rather than its collective capacity. By acknowledging that the tendentiously ignored impacts and mechanisms of collective transformation are those most capable of leading to social and economic development, this research tries to propose a new theoretical framework and empirical approaches to interpret the mechanisms through which culture builds community‐level social impacts. First, a theoretical chain of cultural activities’ community‐level social impacts was proposed, which aligned a set of social capacities based on identified categories of collective level impacts. Second, borrowing analysis models from the field of economics, two case studies were developed to provide new measurement perspectives to meet the methodological challenges of social impact assessment and to identify new mechanisms and drivers of social capacities. This study concludes that culture and the arts can have a strategic function in sustainable community development beyond the expected ability to produce economic externalities. In particular, by inducing a transversal on‐going process of social learning which results in specific social capacities, culture can stimulate a system of networks needed to forge a bottom‐up process of collective action and to sustain cross‐boundary dynamics."
"The objective underlying the three chapters of this thesis is the understanding of the functioning of the labor market to make a diagnosis about the potential regulatory role of a public authority in this market. ln the first chapter, I analyze, from a purely ""positive"" point of view, the ability of the model with search and matching frictions to reproduce short-term fluctuations of labor market variables in the United States. I propose a new calibration strategy, within a general equilibrium framework with sticky prices. In the second chapter (co-written with F. Langot), we study the determinants of changes in the labor supply over the last fifty years. Changes in the tax wedge, and two variables reflecting the institutional framework (the generosity of income in case of ""non-employment"" and workers' bargaining power), can explain the different trajectories of the rate employment and hours worked observed in the United States and three European economies (France, Germany and the United Kingdom). ln the third chapter, I analyze the performance of two alternative systems of social security, within the framework of a model with heterogeneous agents in terms of wealth. The agents are subject to a risk of unemployment, and the planner can provide insurance through a redistibutive tax system, based on a progressive tax and / or unemployment insurance. The progressive tax system is superior in terms of aggregate welfare to the insurance provided through unemployment benefits, through its effect on the functioning of the labor market."
"Two particular concerns in international economics motivate this research: I. How are real and financial activities related to each other in a globalized economy? II. What role do financial frictions play in this relationship ? Three essays look at these questions from different perspectives. The first chapter, in collaboration with Jean-Charles Bricongne and SebastianFranco-Bedoya, revises the old question on the relation between FDI and exports on French firms, where theory seems to be at odds with empirical findings. Most FDI and most trade take place between rich markets, where the horizontal investment type is expected to happen. In this sense, empirical studies have almost invariably found a complementarity relation while standard Horizontal FDI models predict substitutability between FDI and exports given the proximity-concentration trade-off.  [...]The second chapter empirically examines how external financial needs measured at the sector level- and financial development at the country level interact to shape the aggregate marginal product of capital of a country (MPK) and its foreign direct investment inflows (FDI). First, using new available data we construct annual aggregate MPK for 50 developing and developed countries during 1995-2008; we use industry-level data to construct an annual country-level measure of external financial dependence and assess its effects on MPK conditional on the level of financial development. Our findings imply that financial development seems to be a necessary condition -and certainly not a sufficient one- in order for production in financially dependent sectors to positively affect aggregate MPK in developing countries. Second, using bilateral FDI inflows in developing countries between 2001 and 2010, we analyze how external financial dependence and financial development determine FDI in flows in developing countries. [...]The third chapter, joint research with Jean-Charles Bricongne and Fabrizio Coricelli, studies the transmission of global shocks during the Great Recession and its impact on French employment. Particularly, we explore the role of trade credit in the propagation of cross-border shocks. Using a sub-sample of importing enterprises that were active over 2004-2009,our findings imply that strong pre-crisis sourcing ties with countries that were more resilient to the global crisis, translated into better performance in terms of employment growth over 2008-2009. This effect dramatically varies with trade credit intensity. Strongly relying on trade credit made firms more vulnerable to unanticipated shocks, for which the adverse impact of the crisis was exacerbated. This effect intensified among firms with important sourcing ties with severely shocked countries. While the negative effect of the crisis was mitigated when sourcing relations with countries subject to milder shocks were stronger. Supporting, therefore, the hypothesis that trade credit was an alternative source of financing for enterprises during the crisis, where implicitly borrowing from suppliers helped importers overcoming financial constraints. Our contribution to the literature adds to the debate on the role of trade finance in explaining the real economic downturn across borders."
"Policy prescriptions for poor developing countries struggle to expand employment opportunities toraise their income levels. Among these are the MENA Arab countries that have recently experiencedan unprecedented tide of popular uprisings following the rising poverty, inequality and exclusion, muchof which is related to the labor market. Since the flow approach to labor markets has become the basic toolbox to modern labor economics, this thesis has at its central insight explaining the functioning ofthose specific labor markets, particularly the Egyptian and Jordanian, using the search equilibrium theory. It looks at analyzing job accession, separations and mobility trends. Overall, evidence of highlevels of rigidity is revealed. The impact of introducing flexible employment protection regulations in these rigid markets is then discussed both empirically and theoretically. Findings show that lowering firing costs in Egypt increased significantly the job separations, but had no impact on job creations.This partial failure of the liberalization reform is interpreted theoretically by a crowding out effect due to increased corruption set up costs or increased public sector wages. A novel theoretical matching model a la Mortensen Pissarides is developped allowing for the existence of public, formal private and informal private sectors, reflecting the particular nature of developing countries. Workers’ movements up the job ladder is then explored through a structural estimation of the frictional parameters in a job search model a la Burdett Mortensen. These markets are found to have very high levels of search frictions especially among the young workers. Given the non-availability of panel data to study labor market flows, longitudinal retrospective panel datasets are extracted from the Egypt and Jordan Labor Market Panel Surveys. These panels are then compared to available contemporaneous crosssectional information, showing that they suffer from recall and design measurement erros. An original methodology is therefore proposed and developped to correct the biased labor market transitionsboth on the aggregate macro-level, using a Simulated Method of Moments (SMM), as well as on themicro-individual transaction level, using constructed micro-data weights."
"Social interactions are in the core of economic activities. Their treatment in Economies is however often limited to a focus on the market (Manski, 2000). The role social interactions themselves play for the behavior of agents as well as the formation of their attitudes is often neglected. This is despite the fact that already early contributions in economic literature have identified them as important determinants for the decision making of economic agents as for example Sherif (I936), Hyman (1942), Asch (1951 ), Jahoda (I 959) or Merton (1968). ln consumer research, a field on the intersection between Economies, Sociology and Psychology, on the other hand social interactions (social influences) are considered to be the"" ... most pervasive determinants [ ... ] of individual 's behaviour. .. "" (Bumkrant and Cousineau, 1975). The thesis at hand bridges the gap between social interactions and their influence on agents expectation formation and behavior."
"Within the field of strategy, the thesis deals with the concept of capability, defined as a firm’s ability to extend the range of its activities. It defends that capability, because of causal ambiguity, stands within the realm of unobservable and should be studied as such. Proceeding from the firm’s activities (observable), actors make conjectures by intertwining discourse and actions and strive to identify, by trial and error, the firm’s capability (unobservable) that anticipates on future activities. The researcher, with her own tools, develops a similar abduction. The thesis studies the first five US defense firms (Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon) within the 1990-2007 period during which two major changes have happened, a wave of concentration and the emergence of systems of systems. The latter triggered a controversy over the relationship to the customer, studied by industrial marketing, the question being to know whether a new capability should be deployed. Narratives, structured by templates, retrace the strategic trajectories of the firms (through their discourse and internal and external assets orchestration) and are followed by a complementary financial and accounting study. The thesis establishes that strategic coherence can happen without an equivalent coherence of capability; that a firm can develop a contradictory capability; that two dynamics can be put in contrast, capability adaptation on one side and the creation of a new capability on the other, given that the latter disrupts existing markets and leads to a redefinition of coopetition relationships with customers, competitors and suppliers."
"This PhD research proposes to study the relationship between informal risk-coping strategies and the nature of land allocation. Informal risk-coping mechanisms are studied here as one potential factor in the failure of land market reforms and the persistence of `non-market' exchange -gifts or free loans. In particular, we show that the bipolar view of land tenure, which opposes `customary'  to `market' transfers, does not adequately approach informal risk-coping motivations in land transfers. Two hypotheses are analysed: first, in the absence of insurance markets and public social protection, land has a `safety net' function and households do not sell land but prefer other types of transfers (which retain part of the land's `safety net' function). Secondly, informal risk-coping leads households to participate to hybrid forms of transfers (neither market nor non-market) allowing to combine risk-coping motives with other types of economic necessities. Those two hypotheses are then looked at empirically in two case studies: in Vietnam, where households sell their land only if they are economically stable or have suffered income shocks (distress sales); and in Thailand, where a survey has been done among permanent rural-urban migrants. This surveyconfirms that informal risk-coping slows down land sale markets and sustains transfers such as free-loans. Finally, the Thai data identify traditional risk-sharing institutions in the allocation of land, especially through intra-family free-loans or `disguised rentals'. As a main conclusion,  insurance and public protection policies could have a key role in the evaluation of land allocation systems in Thailand and Vietnam."
"Over the past sixty years, the world population has experienced a dramatic surge from 2.5 billion people by the end of World War II, to 7 billion in 2011. This population growth differs from previous episodes not only in importance, but also because of the joint emergence of a new and ongoing trend of rising urbanization. Expected to strengthen worldwide, this trend is a real challenge for the international community in terms of sustainability, especially for food supply. This thesis provides a theoretical treatment of food supply chain sustainability in a context of rapid and unrelenting urbanization. Halfway between economic geography and environmental economics, its primary goal is to allow for a theoretical formalization of ecological and social trade-offs in a spatially explicit framework. Besides, we argue that this issue cannot satisfactorily resolved without paying specific attention to urban-rural interactions. Our work discloses the following major element : because of the tight and inextricable interconnection between urban and rural areas, the ecological assessment of any food supply chain can only be achieved by taking into account both the demographic and physical features of cities."
"Environmental quality having features of a public good is the subject of the thesis. In a theoretical framework, we study a means of environmental regulation of a polluting firm endowed with market power and then determine the optimal decentralized choice of environmental quality. We start with examining how tax avoidance affects the optimal second-best tax on polluting emissions in a monopoly setting. The firm is owned by shareholders who differ in their cost of tax dodging. The optimal tax should correct two negative externalities of avoidance: the firm's free-riding effect and a tax base erosion effect. This free-riding makes the regulator either impotent or unfair, depending on the severity of the environmental damage and the firm's efficiency. Next, we analyze the impact of an environmental tax on the signaling price strategy of a monopoly that communicates to consumers the unobservable information about firm's highenvironmental performance. We use the intuitive and undefeated criteria of equilibrium selection. Asymmetric information places the optimal second-best tax below the level required under complete information. In the case of undefeated equilibria selection, the tax may induce a ""migration"" from separating equilibrium to pooling making the firm prefer to conceal the private information about environmental quality. Finally, we show that market choice of environmental quality by a firm that internalizes environmental damage from polluting emissions is yet suboptimal."
"It is essential to study nonlinear dynamics in mathematics, and it gives us room to interpret such irregular and unpredictable phenomena as a result of deterministic processes, not mere statistical errors or chances. System dynamics is a methodology as well as a method to implement nonlinear dynamic movements.By these two methods, we capture the crisis in the business cycles and test capital accumulation, and technical changes within the framework of the Macro Stock Management model and apply them to those of the Korean economy. In the latter part of this study, various time series analysis tools are used to estimate the effects of investment on the rates of profit and the effects of wage inequality and consumers’ debt on domestic demand since the global financial crisis of2008. Because the Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model impose on the long run or short run restrictions on the VAR system, it uses to distinguish two variables with similar characteristics, such as the after-tax rate of profit and the rate of profit after payment of interests and dividends excluding taxes (the after-payment rate of profit). Perron (1989) argues that the traditional unit root tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test are likely to fail to detect the stationarity or non-stationarity of the data if it has structural breaks. Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) propose the unit root test of the time series data with a single or two breaks in the time series. The Gregory-Hansen test provides information about a structural break in a cointegration test. The Auto Regressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) model is used to capture long-run relationships between variables."
"During the last fort Y years, a large number of studies have analyzed the behaviors related to car holding and use. However, the majority of these studies consider the subject from a static point of view, ignoring the household dynamics and the driver's needs, which are very likely to drive such decisions. The durable character of a vehicle suggests however that such a dynamic cannot be ignored in the study of the vehicle purchase, holding and use decisions. This work employs a disaggregated, structural approach based on real choice to address these dynamics. The document is composed of three parts. In the first part a description of the problem is provided through an analysis of the available literature. The second part includes the description of the operations which are performed on ""Parc Auto"". This database needs in fact some preliminary treatment if one wants to use it as a vehicle's Panel. In the last part the four applications considered are presented. A first application proposes a hedonic approach to the vehicles' prices. The second chapter of this last part estimates the Rust model for mono-equipped (Le. only one car owned each year) households' decisions concerning their car. A dynamic discrete\continuous choice model of car holding duration and use for both myopic and forward-Iooking agents follow. ln the last chapter a dynamic forward-Iooking program for the purchase planning problem is presented. ln the three dynamic applications, a discount factor tests different effects of dynamic behavior. My findings indicate that a household's time preference is a crucial element in studying these decisions."
"In a world where networks become a dominant form of organization, the structure of networks and the position of individuals in these networks affect individual behavior and aggregate economic outcomes. The analysis of network formation by a central planner or by individuals themselves is at the heart of this thesis on the economics of networks.Chapter 1 theoretically studies the optimal formation and protection of networks by a central planner knowing that an external agent can destroy k links. The protection of the network can be guaranteed either by densifying the links between nodes, or by protecting the links. When the cost of protection is relatively small, a minimally connected network composed of protected links guarantees the communication flow; if this cost is high, the optimal solution is to form a symmetric network where each node has at least k+1 non-protected links.Chapter 2 explores the decentralized formation of networks in the laboratory by analyzing individual linking formation decisions when one agent has a higher value than others and that the linking formation process is sequential. The results show that sequentiality facilitatesthe coordination on efficient networks but that do not correspond to the Subgame PerfectEquilibrium. The heterogeneity across agents increases the asymmetry of networks because of the polarization of links on the agent with a higher value.Chapter 3 studies the impact of the endogenous formation of networks on the importance of peer effects, applied to dishonest behavior. In order to identify the effects of social comparisons, two controlled environments are designed in the laboratory in which individuals choose or not their peers, and then observe their behavior. The results show that peer effects on dishonest behavior are significantly higher when individuals can choose their peers."
"Our research object is twofold: understand a strategic organizational competences bulding using IT, on the one hand, and go beyond the existing analysis of impacts of the IT models, integrating a multidimensional approach, on the other hand. We privileged an empirical approach beginning with a pilot case study that allowed us to define a theoretical framework of an abductive way, by a constant back and forth between the field and the theoretical existing constructs. The conceptual framework is a synthesis of the various RBV strands integrating the concept of organizational learning. The results of a multicase study underline the diffused and partially intentional character of a process, requiring interaction of additional resources highly dependent from the past, and leading to improve efficiency of the routines and dynamic adaptability. We propose a design of the process and discuss significant concepts for the study of this phenomenon."
"This dissertation is composed of four chapters and addresses an empirical regularity about which very little is known: “plural forms”. In the first chapter, I intend to verify what has been theorized about plural forms and how this field has evolved over time. I identified two variables that underlie most of the theoretical explanations for the existence and stability of plural forms: asset specificity and uncertainty. However, these variables are very seldom explored, which points towards the need for novel contributions. In the second chapter, I am concerned with explaining the variety of plural form manifestations. I built a theoretical model integrating asset specificity and uncertainty to predict plural and non-plural forms. Next, I stressed that plural forms are heterogeneous and built hypotheses relating different types of uncertainty to different types of plural forms. In the next two chapters, I empirically confront my theoretical model and hypotheses with qualitative data. In the third chapter, I confront my model by performing an embedded clinical case study on the Korin company (in Brazil), which produces and commercializes multiple organic products; while in the final chapter, I intend to empirically confront both my theoretical model and my hypotheses and survey the procurement of inputs by 24 companies operating in the Brazilian Agribusiness sector. I find support for my model and for my hypotheses on both of these papers, indicating a path for further analyses."
"This dissertation endeavors to understand the impact of multiple strategic orientations on the performance of the micro family business in developing economy settings in three distinct phases. First, we raised a question whether family micro-entrepreneurs gain performance benefits by developing simultaneously high levels of entrepreneurial-oriented and market-oriented activities. We also investigated whether these complementary strategic orientations on performance are rewarded by cultivating high levels of firm social capital in the form of business and social network ties. In addition, we raised a question how family fits together in the context of multiple strategic orientations to achieve superior performance. The initial study, therefore, yielded a rich research theme related to family business in the context of institutionally constrained environment. We have shown that micro family businesses do maximize their business performance by investing on higher levels of entrepreneurial and market orientation. Furthermore, firm socialization process with their external business entities increase the performance benefits by combined effects of entrepreneurial and market orientations in an emerging market setting. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the study revealed that business profitability increases when both orientations are high but only when family involvement is low. This result yielded important insights into the role of family influence in shaping firm strategic behaviors to achieve better performance. The subsequent study, therefore, reviews and revealed the dark and bright side of the family in combination with entrepreneurial and market orientation behaviors and its consequent impact on performance. The final quantitative study contradicts previous research finding revealing the importance of family-based capabilities in supporting risk-taking behaviors to increase family wealth in an emerging market setting."
"This dissertation provides an empirical analysis of how employers use different long-term contract terminations: firing for personal reasons (LMP) and for economic reasons (LME), as well as the ""rupture conventionnelle"" (Re) enacted in 2008. We propose, in the field of the economic analysis of employment protection legislation, to understand how employers actually use these different types of terminations following a more inductive approach. With the aim of having a better statistical understanding in employers' practices, one major contribution ofthis dissertation is to analyze the interdependencies across the use of each termination. ln this line, we argue that the different types of termination have become less distinct from each other. More specifically, our results indicate that the economic environment and the strategies ofhuman resource management played a central role in the use of the LME, the LMP or the RC, but these determinants have variable influence depending on the nature of the termination. ln the analysis on the case of the RC, which is based on a mutual agreement between employers and employees, we frrst show that the RC results from a historical and institutional development process of forms of terminations considered as ""negotiated"". Then, we assess the impact of the introduction of the RC on the employers' frre decisions and on the use of the other terminations. ln accordance with the theoretical literature, our results would suggest that the RC has made easier the terminations of employment relationship. However, we do not find any evidence of a substitution between the RC and the LMP, which have become more expensive and riskier."
"The mad cow, avian flu and dioxin chicken crises have contributed to the strengthening of the sanitary and phytosanitary requirements of public authorities and private actors. This doctoral work is therefore part of an evolving context in which pesticides use is more regulated. Whereas public authorities have defined, at national level, MRLs (Maximum Residue Levels) and the list of authorized molecules, private actors have set up standards to ensure that all means have been put in place to ensure produce quality. A reduction in the use of pesticides has been a recurring objective of public authorities and private actors, especially producers. The literature on the reduction of phytosanitary products refers to innovations whose stakes concern the protection not only of consumers' and farmers' health but also of the environment. Insofar as the reduction of phytosanitary products is a complex process, in both quantitative and qualitative terms, this reflection is concerned both with factors that lead producers to implement more environmentally-friendly practices and with quantifications made of this use. The articulation between the theory, data and econometric modeling has guided the realization of the articles of this doctoral work.
Two contexts are more specifically considered: wine-growers in France and tomato producers in Turkey. Their specificities make them relevant case studies. The wine industry in France is one of the most intensive in terms of the use of pesticides. The aim is to identify the levers that would allow this sector to reduce its use of pesticides. The choice of the tomato sector in Turkey is driven by the fact that the country is currently in the process of pre-accession, which implies harmonization of its legislation with European legislation, and secondly that the production of tomatoes, intended to be sold both on the local and the export markets, contributes strongly to the agricultural sector. The challenge is to analyze an emerging country whose regulation of the use of phytosanitary products is improving. The studies carried out are complementary and aim, each in their own way, at enriching the
understanding of the use of phytosanitary products by enlightening points that are not or insufficiently addressed in the literature:
1) Most studies are static or cross-sectional. The thesis explores the stability of behaviors through a panel analysis and concludes that the behavior of wine producers in France is stable overtime. Producers whose use of pesticides was the least intensive in the previous period are also those whose practices will be the most environmentally-friendly.
2) The level of analysis commonly used is farm scale. The thesis questions the relevance of a more precise level of analysis, that of the plot, allowed by the existence of adequate data. The main result of the study is that French wine-growers have consistent practices from one treatment to another and from one plot to another. As a result, there is a duality of behavior with, on the one hand, 55% of producers who never overdose their treatments and almost 25% who overdose them systematically.
3) The literature on the influence of downstream on IPM practices of producers is still emerging. Two results from this work confirm the influence of downstream segments. In the case of Turkey, the results show that producers adapt to downstream requirements. In the case of organic arboricultural producers in France, a more original result is that the marketing strategy and the productive strategy are co-determined."
"The objective of this doctoral dissertation is to look at the factors that determine the decisions of youth and their parents regarding youth occupation and thereby to understand the conditions for integrating youth into family farming.
In developing countries, there are increasing concerns that the younger generations may lose interest in farming, since this is likely to threaten global food security in the long-term. The increasing importance of migration and non-farm activities to rural livelihoods in developing countries has raised a scholarly debate about whether smallholder farming holds a potential for the youth in the future at all. However, especially in a Southeast Asian context, there are only very few available studies concerned with understanding the options for and the decisions of youth and their parents regarding youth occupation and farm integration.
This dissertation addresses this research gap by drawing on primary data from a fieldwork in Cambodia. Cambodia is home of smallholder rice based farming, and the country experiences rapid population growth. There is therefore a huge need to ensure young peoples' livelihoods and incomes either through their integration in the labour market, or in smallholder farming.
The fieldwork took place in Cambodia's Otdar Meanchey low-density area and Takeo high-density area in 2012 and 2013. Within these two provinces, the fieldwork covered five districts (18 villages). The main purpose of the fieldwork was to understand the current and potential future role of family farming in accommodating young people. The data collection methods included questionnaire surveys, semi-structured and focus group interviews, participant observation, and a case study of an NGO (CEDAC) driven youth-integration-in-farming program. A typology of farming systems and strategies was developed for the survey and discussion.
The dissertation shows that due to low levels of education, the rural youth in Cambodia has few alternatives other than to rely on smallholder rice farming or migrate. Though acknowledging that farming is hard work, rural youth and households do not disregard farm work, and they actually do consider family farming as one of their main options. However, when having engaged in farming even with support from CEDAC, many of the young people experience that farming cannot sustain them and their families. It is therefore common that they re-consider whether they should stay in and/or leave farming, or diversify by seasonal migration.
The results indicate that integrating youth into farming is purely a family decision. Settling in new pioneer areas is one of the household strategies to get access to new land and thereby secure the children's future. Only in situations where plots of land are too small to get sub-divided, households tend to invest in children's higher education. Given that non-farm activities cannot accommodate the growing number of active workers and that land, due to population increase, will have to be sub-divided for families even below the minimum threshold of sustainable living, the study concludes that the future livelihood of children must be secured under the motto of sharing the survival or Chék Khear Ros i.e., by combining both farming and non-farming activities.
The growth of the population in the rural areas of Cambodia, together with the slower pace of job development in the secondary and tertiary sectors, suggest that in the future, more land for cultivation will be needed most likely at the expense of forest and wetland. There will, therefore, be a need for redefining the land tenure systems in the country. One option could be to distribute land from cancelled economic concessions to rural families. There is also a need for further studies of integration programs in Cambodia under social land concessions, which is the existing legal framework for providing access to land for poor people to see if they are still part of the solution."
"Chapter 1Local Development and the Decision to Migrate : Evidence from Mexican Migration to the USMexican migration to the United States is one of the largest migration phenomena and subject to a wide range of studies having reached more than 11 million of Mexican immigrants in the US, which accounts for nearly a tenth of Mexico’s population and a third of all US foreign-born population. Despite having been widely studied, this paper contributes the scarce literature of the supply-side perspective. The paper is comprised by a simple game theoretic model which aims at illustrating the relationship between development outcomes and the decision to migrate and hence to motivate and provide a framework for the empiricalanalysis. Furthermore, the model incorporates a factor that has been recently shown to play a part on the migration decision : organized crime. Recent kidnapping of migrants suggest a new risk affecting trajectories, while a more violent environment may contribute to push migrants away from their homes. We test the model’s findings empirically using household survey data and propose different effects for legal and illegal migrants, as defined by the type of documents used to enter the US. The results from the illegal migrant subsample are in line with our theoretical framework and support the importance of local development variables as a determinant of migration.Chapter 2Foreign Aid, Illegal Migration and Organized CrimeThrough this chapter, the link between foreign aid, illegal migration and development is studied in a game-theoretic framework. We model a sequential game of a foreign government that decides its border control and foreign aid policies, which are known to source country government deciding on the level of investment in domestic development. In this particular framework, aid is used to fight crime organizations in the source country, as it represents a negative externality for the donor. Potential migrants then make their migration decisions after observing both government’s expenditure decisions, which have an impact on the probability of success. The model suggests migration flows are reduced by development expenditure and that the existence of organized crime, reduces the optimal level of aid allocated as crime works as an additional tool for reducing illegal migration. The model isthen tested empirically through a simultaneous equation model using cross-country data on migrant sending countries to eveloped donor countries. Most model predictions are supported by our empirical specification, suggesting indeed a reduction in aid allocation when migration and crime are high.Chapter 3The fall of mobility when moving : A study of social mobility of Mexican migrants to the US This chapter aims to study the impact of parental migration on their children. In concrete, we intend to infer the causal impact of US migration on the intergenerational transmission of education in Mexico. Social mobility and migration had only been analyzed comparingimmigrants and natives in the destination country. Thus, targeting the migrant population from the source-country perspective, our paper contributes the literature with a unique study of the effects of migration on the educational mobility of the left behinds. Using household survey data, we look at the educational attainment of individuals in Mexico and compare it to that of their parents and according to the parents migration status during their childhood. We exploit historical data to solve for the endogeneity of the decision to migrate through an instrumental variables approach, which allows us to draw causal inference of our results. Our results show that, although attractive on the short-term through the alleviation of current poverty, migration may be detrimental to the equality of opportunities on the long-run."
"The consumption of fruit and vegetables presents both economic and public health challenges. Although the nutritional recommendations are well known to consumers, the consumption of French people is constantly decreasing, with only ¼ of them meeting the recommendations in 2016. Supported by several institutions, the professionals in the sector seek to improve the attractiveness of their products, on the one hand by supporting the offer with the promotion and the valorisation of existing products and on the other hand by developing a diversified offer that is better adapted to consumers' expectations.
In this context of increasing supply, this doctoral work aims to better understand and evaluate consumers' interest in fruit and vegetables in general, as well as the novelties proposed by the sector in particular.
In order to understand consumer interest, two approaches are used. The first is the study of consumer behaviour, which identifies and locate many factors that may influence consumer behaviour and preferences towards food. The second is the perceived value, which is used to assess the interest of consumers by determining all the components that can be valued by consumers for the product category.
In order to measure products value for consumers, the concept chosen is the Willingness to Pay (WtP) which allows for the expression, in monetary units, of a judgment on the perceived value of the product. In addition, the analysis of the WtP evaluation methods leads us to consider experimental economics methods whose main interests is to make participants express their real preferences through monetary incentives.
Finally, the importance of these approaches is illustrated by the three experiments carried out during this thesis, which made it possible to measure consumers' interest in several products and for various sources of value."
"This dissertation aims to explore why large employers pay higher wages compared to similar workers in smaller size establishments in the presence of nonrandom assignment of workers. The main focus is to determine the magnitude of the size-wage impact in the presence of selection and to test various methods to explain employer size and wage relationship. The objectives of the dissertation are multifold. One chapter leaves us with sorne questions and that question becomes motivation for the next chapter. AlI the chapters aim to explore the employer size and wage relationship in the presence of selection bias. This is not a new question in labor economics. The econometric methods are not new either. But this is an addition to the French labor market in this literature. Moreover, the methods applied on this question have not been use d, to our knowledge, before, for example, PSM, FIML, and pseudo panel etc."
"Based on the results of a 3-year field study among a population of occasional French workers named after the researcher ""Intermittents du travail"", this research aims at understanding what is expected from today's work and what is rejected in the way executives experience it. After achieving brillant studies and a successful career start as executives in a big company, the ""Intermittents du travail"" left everything to come and live on the French West Coast,attempting to design a new way of working which would grant less space to work and more space to private activities. We choose the theoretical framework of the French psychosociology of work and the clinical practical approach that underlies it (Lhuilier et al.,2013) to interpret the data. By conceiving work transitions as an intricacy between resistance and creation processes, both at micro-and macro-social levels, this approach enables us to unveil some mecanisms potentially harmful in today's work that would make top-level workers deeply unsatisfied about the true nature of a work they had dreamt of and idealized during so many years before.Furthermore, the analysis of the transition's aftermaths reveals the critical aspects of what a ""good job"" should consist in as appositive to the ""bullshit job"" (Graeber,2013)these people experienced previously: the importance of working as a craftsman in every situation- which means to be concerned by the beauty and the quality of work, both using the head and the hands (Sennette,2010)-, the art of unravelling, the capacity of balancing work activities with leisure ones and,among others"
"The theorization of public expenditures in the twentieth century is a rationalization in the language of modern economics of social and political concerns regarding the role of the state. The thesis adopts a historical and philosophical perspective on two central concepts of Richard A. Musgrave's (1910-2007) Theory of Public Finance (1959): merit goods and social goods (or collective goods). Musgrave was more successful in introducing the definition of social (collective) goods in public economics (non-excludable and non-rival) than with his concept of merit goods. Yet, I suggest that he coined the latter because he wanted to build a comprehensive normative theory of the public household that would be useful for steering the revenue-expenditure processes. The two concepts play complementary roles in his theory which is a synthesis of various European traditions in public finance. Despite the rejection of merit goods by many economists, Musgrave's view on redistribution in-kind to fight poverty was shared by many liberal economists in the postwar period. The alternative approach to public finance of Buchanan is also discussed. I show that it is complicated to oppose Musgrave's and Buchanan's approaches along the positive/normative methodological line. In contrast, the friendly discussions between Samuelson and Musgrave led to a refinement of the market failure argument for public provision of collective goods. I identify the centrality of the principle of consumer sovereignty in this paradigm and I show how the literature on the justification of merit goods can be structured with respect to this principle."
"In the New Economy characterized by properties such as globalization, intangibility and inter-connectivity, educational organizations are required to overcome the new challenges, especially the changing nature of the enhanced dynamism and complexity of the requirements from the educational organizations. One of the current strategic philosophies assisting educational organizations to develop strategic capabilities dealing with uncertainty is knowledge management (KM). Through the systematic acquisition, creation, sharing, and use of knowledge, organizations develop, renew and exploit their knowledge-based resources, thereby allowing them to be proactive and adaptable to external changes and attain competitive success. Emerging as a powerful means for sustaining organizational competitiveness, KM has been widely investigated from different perspectives. However, only a limited number of researches have adopted the resource based view of the educational organizations to empirically examine the relationships between KM infrastructure and the different strategies for investing human assets. Meanwhile, research on KM approaches from a dynamic capability approach has been mostly conceptual in nature. It is proposed here that a failure to apply KM approaches may hinder the potentially valuable integrated contribution to organizational strategies for enhancing education of the major components that constitute KM approaches. In addition, a review of the literature shows that most empirical evidence has been obtained in the context of developed countries. The possibility that such models might be adopted in educational organizations to fit the specificities of the developing countries has received very little attention to date. Relying on social learning theory extended by the knowledge and dynamic capability based approaches, this research develops an integrative theoretical mode) of KM capability. Empirical examination of the hypothesized relationships among variables is conducted by means of questionnaire surveys in Saudi Arabia. For the pilot study, 30 draft questionnaires were directly distributed to senior managers participating in the Global Knowledge Society Forum 2013 took place in King Abdul Aziz Center for World Culture, ARAMCO Saudi Arabia, during the period of9-10 December 2103. The responses returned with complete data were assessed, using factor analysis and reliability testing, to refine and finalize the questionnaire administered in the main survey."
"This thesis aims to economically analyze the quality and efficiency of universities and university systems at an international level of comparison, by using input/output indicators and the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. The thesis is composed of four chapters. The first chapter entitled ""university rankings: a critical perspective"" presents and evaluates the relevance of inputs/outputs indicators used by most university rankings. It is the opportunity to present a number of criticisms found in the literature and focus on a common methodological problem in the rankings. It is the use of inputs as measures of university quality. This practice confuses means and results and ignores the basic concepts of accounting models in terms of production functions and efficiency. The second chapter entitled ""characteristics and rankings of universities : around some factors that can explain the differences in performance between universities"", compares the results of two rankings: QS-Times and Shanghai and offers a list of factors that may explain why there are such differences in quality, according to these rankings between universities. [...] The third chapter entitled ""performance and efficiency of universities and their determinants: an evaluation using world university rankings and DEA methodology"" evaluates on the basis of a DEA methodology the efficiency of 214 universities from 13 different countries, in order to find if the top ranked universities among traditional rankings are also universities that best utilize their financial and human resources. [...] The fourth chapter titled ""efficiency of university systems in 35 countries and its determinants: an assessment by DEA methodology and the calculation of Malmquist indices (2006-2012)"" assesses the efficiency and performance of university systems of 35 countries. It offers new scores for overall efficiency that complement the first two studies on this topic in the literature by Agasisti (2011) and St.Aubyn et al (2009). Compared to the article of Agasisti (2011), we identify five new developments in our study : the sample is higher (35 countries instead of 18), the observation period is updated, the evolution of efficiency between two periods is calculated, the number of inputs and outputs incorporated into each model is higher and a specific model for evaluating the efficiency of research is proposed. Our study confirms the thesis that the university systems of Switzerland and the United Kingdom are the most efficient. It also shows based on the calculations of Malmquist indices between 2006 and 2012 that teaching efficiency of 35 reviewed university systems has a tendency of declining while the research efficiency and that of attractivity-reputation is rather increasing. This allows a better assessment of the impact of reforms inspired by the Shanghai ranking on university systems. These reforms led the academic staff of universities to abandon their focus on teaching in favor of research activities."
"This PhD thesis addresses the effects of private equity on corporate governance (Chapter 1 and 2) and the determinants of Venture Capital (VC) investments (Chapter 3). The first two chapters examine the changes that private equity investors introduce in the governance of their portfolio companies (in terms of CEO turnover) after a Public-to-Private (PTP) operation. Our empirical results show that (i) PE-backed companies exert a more active monitoring, and are more likely to dismiss their CEO than public firms (Chapter 1) (ii) PE-backed companies with more specialized investors are less likely to dismiss their CEO than other PE-backed companies (Chapter 2). From a theory perspective, the findings that CEO turnover rate and CEO turnover-performance sensitivity are higher in PE-backed companies comparing with public firms (Chapter 1) seem to support the ‘control hypothesis’, i.e., the contention that the concentrated (and illiquid) ownership structure of PE-backed companies provides stronger shareholder monitoring and a tighter control for poor performance than the dispersed ownership structure of public firms. For companies with similar concentrated ownership structures (i.e., our sample of PE-backed companies in Chapter 2), our results rather support the ‘inside information hypothesis’ of boards advanced by Cornelli and Karakas (2015). This theory suggests that sophisticated investors (e.g. specialized PE firms) are more likely to use ‘soft’ (inside) information when they evaluate the CEO’s competence and the decision to dismiss the CEO. In contrast, less sophisticated investors are more likely to base their decision on ‘hard’ information, e.g., the firm’s performance relative to its peers. Finally, Chapter 3 is related to debate on the determinants of venture capital development. We try to assess how particular mechanisms of governmental support to innovation impact VC investments, and whether the institutional environment moderates the relationship between governmental R&D and VC investments. Our results show that higher level of governmental R&D expenditures lead to higher level of VC investments. We found also that higher quality of formal institutions is associated with higher level of early stage VC activity. Contrary to what was expected, the quality of the institutional environment has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between governmental R&D expenditures and VC activity. A possible interpretation of this result is that in the presence of highly developed formal institutions the technological opportunities measured by governmental R&D expenditures have no stimulating effect on venture capital development."
"This thesis analyses the specific channels through which transparency promotes the growth of companies apprehended by investment efforts and reduces financing constrains. This work has two objectives. The first objective is to build two transparency measures, microeconomic and macroeconomic, through a multiple discriminant analysis performed on a sample of 64 countries between 1997 and 2009. This analysis put the emphasis on the factors that influences the most either the microeconomic or the macroeconomic transparency levels. Second, the Integration of the transparency measures in an Euler equation allowed to assess the effects of microeconomic and macroeconomic transparency on the financing constrains and the real investment level. This second study was based on data collected on 5652 companies between 2005 and 2009. The output is a prioritization of both kinds of transparency effects. We found that these effects are more important for emerging countries. This study also concludes that microeconomic and macroeconomic transparencies reduce financing constrains further for the firms with lower indebtedness. Transparencies stimulate investment further for the firms with higher indebtedness. This study finally highlights the non-linearity of microeconomic transparency effects on investment and also the non-linearity of macroeconomic transparency effect on financing constrains and on investment."
"Among the world’s 500 largest firms, one out of five is Chinese. In 2014, 94 Chinese firms were among the world leaders in R&D. Since 2016, China is the first acquirer of foreign firms and is now targeting high-technology firms.These recent developments raise questions about the technological positioning of Chinese firms. Studying this topic requires looking at their conditions of emergence. We can look at China’s development from the perspective of the technological catch-up model (Kim, 1997). China has gone through three phases: a  phase of acquisition of foreign technology following the country’s opening in 1978, a period of technological assimilation and production of increasingly complex products, and a period of technological integration characterized by technological improvement and the reconfiguration of existing technologies.The hypothesis we make is that firms are now in the last phase of catch-up, and have entered a period of transition to technology leadership. This leads to two questions. What is Chinese innovation today? This topic broadly refers to innovation in emerging countries. How far are Chinese firms from reaching the technological frontier?We observe the transition through the way major Chinese firms engage in research. The integration of emerging technologies into their research strategies reflect dynamics of technological learning which, if they are not yet visible in the market, indicate a transition. Our results show that the trend is significant, with half of large firms (48%) engaging in nanotechnology research. This proportion indicates that Chinese firms have reached the technological frontier. This, however, does not mean that Chinese firms have reached the frontier in other dimensions, such as the organizational dimension. We also show that there are several modalities of commitment to research. While some large Chine firms engage in research by adopting a model similar to that of American or European firms, other dynamics are at work, which reflect, in particular, their historical legacy, and the impact of their localization.To obtain these results, we have built a unique database of 325 large industrial enterprises, and have looked at their patenting activities in nanotechnology, directly or through their subsidiaries, based on the exploitation of sources in English and Chinese."
"The signaling perspective argues that when a firm limits the extent of its sustainability disclosure, it prevents stakeholders from evaluating its achieved degree of sustainability performance, and may thus reach higher financial returns. However, transparency is an institutionalized norm that stakeholders value, and firms may not be able to limit their disclosure without being penalized. This thesis therefore raises the question of whether firms can strategically limit their sustainability disclosure to reach higher profits, or if pressure for conformity to the norm of transparency exists and weakens such strategies. Using econometrical methods, this thesis empirically shows that sustainability raters do not converge in their assessment of firms’ sustainability performance, supporting the assumption that firmsmay prevent stakeholders from evaluating their actual degree of sustainability. It also shows that less sustainable and more reputed firms are more likely to limit their sustainability disclosure, that highly sustainable firms encounter higher short and long term financial returns when they adopt an extensive disclosure, and that less sustainable firms, on the contrary are more profitable in the short term when theylimit their disclosure. This thesis therefore shows that in line with the signaling perspective, firms may strategically adjust the extent on their disclosure to reach higher returns in the short term. However, in the long term, normative pressure for transparency is too high and weakens the benefits of such strategies."
"This thesis is breathing new life into the location choice models of establishments. The need for methodological advances in order to more realistically model the complexity of establishment decision-making processes, such as their optimal location choices, is the key motivation of this thesis. First, location choice models use geo-referenced data, for which choice sets have an explicit spatial component. It is thus critical to understand how to represent spatial aspect in location choice models. The final decision of an establishment seems to be related to the surrounding economic landscape. When accounting for the linkage between neighboring observations, the decision on the spatial weight matrix specification must be made. Yet, researchers overwhelmingly apply the Euclidean metric without realizing its underlying assumptions and its alternatives. This representation has been originally proposed due to scarce data and low computing power, rather than because of its universality. In areas, such as the Paris region, where high congestion or uncrossable physical barriers problems clearly arise, distances purely based on topography may not be the most appropriate for the study of intra-urban location. There are insights to be gained by mindfully reconsidering and measuring distance depending on a problem being analyzed. Rather than locking researchers into a restrictive structure of the weight matrix, this thesis proposes a flexible approach to intimate which distance metric is more likely to correctly account for the nearby markets depending on the sector considered. In addition to the standard Euclidean distance, six alternative metrics are tested: travel times by car (for the peak and off-peak periods) and by public transit, and the corresponding network distances. Second, what makes these location choices particularly interesting and challenging to analyze is that decisions of a particular establishment are interrelated with choices of other players.These thorny problems posed by the interdependence of decisions generally cannot be assumed away, without altering the authenticity of the model of establishment decision making. The conventional approaches to location selection fail by providing only a set of systematic steps for problem-solving without considering strategic interactions between the establishments in the market. One of the goals of the present thesis is to explore how to correctly adapt location choice models to study establishment discrete choices when they are interrelated.Finally, a firm can open a number of units and serve the market from multiple locations. Once again, traditional theory and methods may not be suitable to situations wherein individual establishments, instead of locating independently from each other, form a large orgnization, such as a chain facing a fierce competition from other chains. There is a necessity to incorporate interactions between units within the same and competing firms. In addition, the need to state a clear difference between the daytime and nighttime population has been emphasized. Demand is represented by pedestrian and car flows, the crowd of potential clients passing through the commercial centers, train and subways stations, airports, and highly touristic sites. The Global Survey of Transport (EGT 2010), among others, is of service to reach this objective. More realistically designed location choice models accounting for spatial spillovers, strategic interaction, and with a more appropriate definition of distance and demand can become a powerful and flexible tool to assist in finding a befitting site. An appropriately chosen location in turn can make an implicative difference for the newly-created business. The contents of this thesis provide some useful recommendations for transport analysts, city planners, plan developers, business owners, and shopping center investors."
"The object of this thesis is to discover the intercultural competencies that determine manager’s readiness for organizational change. Through the analysis of twelve main hypotheses; regarded as intercultural competence; involving cognitive capabilities, emotional abilities and behavioural/social skills in managers; and their influence on readiness for change, the procedure to validate the general hypothesis includes an electronic self-administered  questionnaire  and a total of five hundred and fifty seven respondents from sixty-eight different nationalities. The respondents are managers of corporations who hold strategic, tactical or operational management  positions;  that is,  managers who are responsible for long-term planning, progress monitoring, or day-to-day operational supervision.The understanding of the concept of intercultural competence is a central aspect in this dissertation and therefore the theoretical part has been written discretionarily  by the researcher  concerning the selected references upon which the conceptual  framework was built.  An  empirical  part  is  supported  with  a quantitative  methodological analysis in order to prove that there  is a significant positive correlation between intercultural competence and managers’ readiness for organizational change."
"The aim of this PhD dissertation is to provide new insights about the limits of borrowing. It includes four essays which provide theoretical, methodological and empirical results. The first chapter contributes to the theory of limits of borrowing by a study of lender of last resort (LOLR) in an original model. The second chapter contributes to methodology by introducing a new approach to test and measure the limits of borrowing econometrically. It also contributes to the empirical understanding of the limits of borrowing by applying the new approach to test the cyclical behavior and the effects of regulation on the limits of borrowing. The third chapter contributes to our empirical understanding of the effect of limits of borrowing on consumption. The fourth chapter yields new insight about the effect of bank ownership on the limits of borrowing during a financial crisis."
"This dissertation titled “Essays in the Political Economy of Inflation” is comprised of three  papers  which  study  the  problem  of  inflation  from  a  political-institutional perspective. All the three essays apply modern technical tools of macroeconomics to study different factors that affect the choice of policies. It is shown that these factors are crucial in shaping the  governance structure conducive for policy effectiveness. The complex political-economic environment is difficult to study with traditional models of economic policy based on a benevolent social planner maximizing the utility of a representative individual.  This thesis, therefore, approaches the political economy of inflation from a realistic practical side. The first essay titled “Taxing the unobservable: The impact of shadow economy oninflation and taxes”, is motivated from several theoretical and empirical studies which argue that optimal inflation rate increases in the size of informal economy. In this paper, we construct a small theoretical model that has two key components. First, it explicitly models the government’s choice for income or inflation tax. Our framework is general and does not impose any condition about the nature of the government (i.e., it does not require government to be necessarily benevolent or corrupt). Secondly, we explicitly consider the shadow economy in the government’s objective function. It allows us to see how  it  impacts  the  tax  burden  and  inflation.    Our  theoretical  model  indicates  an increasing marginal cost of taxes and an  increasing rate of inflation in  the shadow economy. The principle of marginal substitution rationalizes the government’s choice of inflation tax over income tax."
"This thesis aims at explaining the link between trade mark use and innovative activities. The first chapter describes the main legal aspects of trade marks and reviews existing literature in economics and management relating to them. The second chapter analyses how and why firms use trade marks and how they integrate them in their innovative activities. Through a theoretical and empirical approach, we show that trade marks are used in relation to innovations which are at the interface of the market, mainly product and marketing innovations. The third chapter then studies the interrelated effect of trade marks and patents in the protection of innovation. We show that depending on market characteristics, they may complement or substitute each other. In the fourth and final chapter, we explore the patterns of trade mark use by academic institutions, and investigate how these relate to their research activities."
"Europe in the 21st century is a continent of cultural and ethnic diversity. Recent enlargement of the European Union to 27 states, constant flows of free trade and the migration of people have resulted in an increasingly diverse Europe. National health systems face the challenge of accommodating the cultural diversity of healthcare providers and service users. The Irish health system is an example of a national health system which has attempted to implement adequate planning and delivery of care and support services, encompassing the needs of minority ethnic communities (MECs) in a new and rapidly changing multicultural Ireland.This research focuses on the challenges of recent multiculturalism in Ireland and describes the Irish health sector’s process in the construction of the Whole Organisation Approach (WOA) as the framework for Irish hospitals to respond to the management of diversity and the provision of culturally sensitive healthcare service delivery to members of MECs.The aim of the research is to investigate how six hospitals have implemented the Whole Organisation Approach as recommended in the Irish Health Services Executive’s National Intercultural Health Strategy 2007-2012. Research findings indicate to what extent the Irish strategy has been implemented in each hospital and outline factors that promote and impede successful implementation at a hospital level and analyses how each of the three strands, i.e. organisational ethos, workplace environment and service elements necessary to support intercultural training, of the WOA have been implemented across the 6 hospitals."
"Environmental conservation and poverty reduction are two priorities in developing countries. However, there is still no agreement in the literature on the nature of the relationship between these two major issues.  While some consider that these objectives are conflicting, others believe they can only be achieved simultaneously. This thesis aims at improving the understanding of the relationship between environmental conservation and welfare, as well as of mechanisms that moderate this relationship. More precisely, our analysis concentrate on the study of the relationships between the establishment of protected areas, ecotourism development and local welfare in Nepal.In the first chapter, we explore the links between the variables that will be of interest throughout the thesis. Therefore, we measure the nature and the strength of the relationship between (1) protected areas and welfare, (2) ecotourism and welfare and (3) the interaction between protected areas and ecotourism, and welfare. We use the PLS regression method, which is appropriate considering the limited theoretical knowledge on the relationship between the variables, as well as the strong correlation between certain variables.  Results show that protected areas, ecotourism development and welfare are positively linked. This justify the relevance of elaborating more on the structure of the relationships between the variables, which is achieved in the next chapters. In the second chapter, we develop a theoretical model on the relationship between environmental conservation and welfare. In the literature, theoretical and empirical results on this relationship diverge.  Most of theoretical models assume that protected land remain unused, which does not appear to be empirically verified.  Therefore, we include in our theoretical model a productive sector that develops with conservation efforts. Results indicate that, when conservation is combined with an alternative sector development, it can generate a welfare increase. We validate this theoretical conclusion using econometric methods. Data used in the first and second chapters do not allow to distinguish household living inside a protected area, and those involved in the ecotourism sector. Variables measured at the district level must thus be used to capture the effect of ecotourism and conservation. In the third chapter, we present a methodological and statistical report of the household survey that we conducted is 2013, in Nepal. The objective of the survey is to collect the information required to measure the effect of ecotourism development and environmental conservation on welfare, using representative and household-level data.  In this chapter, we detail the survey methodology and present the descriptive results obtained.Finally, in chapter 4, we use the data collected to measure the effect of ecotourism and environmental restrictions on household welfare. We develop a two-level hierarchical linear model, that is appropriate considering the database hierarchical and clustered structure. We show that getting involved in an occupation directly linked to ecotourism, as a self-employed, increases household consumption expenses. Besides, this implication in the sector generates positive externalities on the welfare of households located nearby. This chapter is complementary to the others since results allow to conclude on causality links between the variables, and therefore to formulate environmental and development policy recommendations."
"Most studies on financial centers relate to the banking system. The other financial sectors seem to be neglected. The purpose of this work is to assess the competitiveness and attractiveness of international financial centers as far as investment funds are concerned.Through several recent studies on the competitiveness and attractiveness of financial centers, we have been able to identify strategies for the emergence of financial centers. We have thus defined several determining factors of attractiveness and competitiveness that are applied to financial centers by a critical analysis of the various evaluation indicators of those concepts. A theoretical approach to the interaction of the concepts of “financial centers”, “competitiveness”, “attractiveness” and “investment funds industry” allows us to address the basic elements of the analysis of competitiveness and attractiveness in the funds industry.  Beginning with a definition of  the funds economy, we investigate the relationship between the funds industry and its immediate environment (investors and States).Through a survey of professionals in the center, we consider the basis of the emergence of the center in Luxembourg.  Using an econometric approach, we also address the impact of the funds industry on foreign direct investment. The main interest of this thesis is to compare the results of theoretical and econometric modelling with data from a survey of investment fund professionals. The choice of those surveyed is guided by the importance of the Luxembourg financial center in Europe."
"Small farms (identified by statistical services as farms with a standard output of less than 25000€) are relatively unknown and condemned to disappear by French and European agricultural modernization policies. In the 2010 agricultural census, 178 000 farms are counted as small farms, representing more than 36% of metropolitan French farms. In the first chapter, we present a statistical description of small farms in comparison with medium and large farms. Small farms are mostly run by elderly farmers with low levels of education/training who work half-time on the farm and have little additional workforce. In the second chapter, we implement a typology of small farms using a mixed classification method. We obtain five different groups and deduce potential strategies developed by small farms. These strategies are partially confirmed by the study of different small farms trajectories between 2000 and 2010. We find farmers close to cessation of farming, as well as farmers in the setting-up stage and farmers who are not in a transition phase. This statistical analysis is completed in the third chapter by field surveys. The first survey is administered in less favored areas of the Baronnies of the Pyrénées, and the second one in the peri-urban area of Montpellier. These surveys are complemented by statistical data from the 2010 agricultural census to assess the environmental, social and economic contributions of small farms. The fourth chapter focuses on the Common Agricultural Policy. With the enlargement of the EU, small farms found a place in political discourse. We suggest ways of adapting the 2014-2020 CAP support schemes to small farms. We study the Small Farms Scheme and its advantages as a simplified scheme involving an unconditional flat-rate. We then review measures to favour employment in small farms and measures to facilitate setting-up and access to agricultural land."
"This thesis intends to evaluate, develop and test different qualitative methods and ways of ex-post assessing the impacts and contribution of the research on innovation processes and the society, in relation to the transition to organic agriculture.We have conducted two case studies focusing on the transition to organic farming. First is the Camargue case (in France) that encompasses a broad range of technical innovations. Second is on the development of the organic product Ecostop to protect bees against the varroatosis disease in Bulgaria.We evaluate the potential of a broad approach based on the Participatory Impact Pathway Analysis (PIPA) and adapted & complemented by several other methods (first article, part 4), as well as the potential of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) (second paper, part 5) and of the Actor Network Theory (ANT) (third paper, part 6), in evaluating ex-post the impacts and contribution of the research. We study the impacts of the research in the Camargue and how they were generated. The Bulgarian case is only used to evaluate the potential of ANT (together with the Camargue case).The approach based on PIPA allows assessing successfully the impacts and contribution of the research. We could show that the research contributed to change in the Camargue by developing co-learning interactions with farmers although this was not critical to the success of the innovation as a whole. The agricultural policies, economic factors, the testing conducted independently by farmers, and the institutional framework, were the most important and influential factors. With respect to SNA, it was of interest to validate stakeholders’ views on actors’ relationships and their implications on the transition to organic farming. For example, the growing role played by INRA (National Research Agronomic Institute) within the actor network was confirmed as well as its contribution to the transition. As to ANT, it allows highlighting interpersonal actors’ relationships and their effects on the innovation development. We particularly underline the importance of opinion leaders in the phases of implementation and diffusion; and also show the importance of problematizing the issues to be tackled in order to increase the success of research programs."
"In the 1960s and before, the international aluminium market has been hold up as a paradigm for oligopolistic company organisation. A small number of strongly integrated conglomerates (the six Majors) did indeed control virtually the entire aluminium sector, from bauxite extraction to alumin and aluminum bar production as well as the manufacturing of finished aluminium products. From the 1970s onwards, this monopoly has been more and more called into question, in particular by cash-fuelled mining corporations and state-owned companies driven by different motivations. When the London Metal Exchange (LME) introduced the Aluminium contract in December 1978, the days of the 6 Majors’ monopoly were counted. From there on, prices have been fixed by producers and the market. This thesis aims at determining whether the LME, a pioneering exchange and the prime market for non-iron metals, efficiently fulfils its financial functions concerning aluminium: information about prices and the market situation, legal protection against price fluctuation risks, price stabilization."
"The big French companies, which have inadvertently falsified their results, are asking for efficient governance systems, especially on the reliability of the information they are spreading.In order to reinitiate new confidence for stake holders, this thesis aims to explain the influence of governance mechanisms on the quality of financial communication. To answer this research question, we have analyzed the link between financial communication and governance. Then wecreated a formula, from current financial theory, using a set of hypotheses related to the influence ofthe financial market, the flow of capital and the board of directors on the quality of financial communication. To test these hypotheses, we have built a model to measure the quality of financial communication. After our empirical study on companies of the SBF 120, we built an empirical model explaining governance mechanisms of the financial communication‟s quality."
"Home-based service activities embody a significant potential for employment creation and solutions to social needs. Their main characteristics include a strong relational dimension that affects their quality and a spatial distance that complicates the control of service quality. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the quality control practices of home-based service organizations and the representations that actors have of service quality.On the empirical side, the qualitative approach is based on two studies, one regarding services to dependent people (SAD), the other concerning services to other people (SAP). 38 interviews are carried-out with managing directors and quality managers, 169 recommendations from consumers and 318 recommendations from contact-employees are collected on the Internet (electronic word-of-mouth), the methodology being completed with participant-observation. The data collected are subject to a content analysis.The empirical studies enable to identify the perceived-quality factors used by consumers and contact-employees, seven steps of the production process being associated to the three control process steps, as well as the goals set and the control mechanisms used at each step. The results show the influence of the legal framework chosen by the service organization (service provider versus authorised representative) on service quality control practices. They also emphasize the necessary coherence between the manager’s representation of service quality and the control mechanisms used to influence this quality."

"In 1997, the Egyptian government launched a reform aimed at improving quality in public hospitals. Thisreform has largely been a failure, to the point that a new reform was implemented in 2007. The failure ofthese two reforms has been widely documented. Our masters’ degree research shows what gap there isbetween texts on quality, probably imported without thinking, from other countries, and their application.Working methods, styles of communication, conceptions of time and authority are different and causemisunderstandings. It appears difficult to make systems and people with different cultures and norms ofbehaviors work together.Our research focuses on the confrontation between two cultures through the implementation of qualityprocedures in public hospitals in Egypt. We show that these approaches are essentially of North Americaninspiration. However, despite the difference between standards developed in a context different from theEgyptian one, success has occasionally been achieved. This leads us to formulate the following question:How is, in a case of success, the transposition of management tools performed from the North Americancontext to an Egyptian context?In order to answer this question we are using the concept of interaction between action / structure, borrowedfrom the neo-institutional theory and from structuration theory."
"The disclosure of information to workers (DIW) has obtained a legal legitimacy with the creation of works councils after the Second World War in France, but in practice, it has become a managerial issue since the industrial revolution.This PHD dissertation tries to identify the evolution of DIW, explaining its context and, finally, what caused the evolution of DIW since 1884.In this objective, the managerial press and especially the accounting journal could be used to identify the recurrence of DIW and to link it with both the social and economic context of each period.Regarding the practice, we analyse three main case studies of three major French steel companies: De Wendel, Schneider and Usinor during a long period (1884 - 1982). Through these case studies, we propose an analysis model of the managerial decision of disclosing information to workers. This decision is explained by four components: the environment, the targeted public, the stake of DIW and the role of a facilitator."
"This PhD thesis focuses on the diffusion of management accounting systems in the urban water sector. These are defined as a set of performance indicators, performance incentive mechanisms, and control practices. This topic is of particular interest considering the strong economic, social and environmental challenges of this sector. Intervention research carried out within the Ugandan urban water utility was our main focus. We analysed the case through the neo-institutional sociology lense in an abductive and interpretative approach. Using the concept of institutional logic, we interpreted the institutionalisation of performance contracts as associated with the domination of a market logic. We highlighted the key role of funding agencies’ recommendations and the socio-political context in this institutional change. The management accounting systems appear as vehicles structuring the materialisation of the market logic into organisational structures, roles, and practices. Once embedded, they constrain institutional innovation processes. Actors from the organisational field have used them to carry out an institutional work, aiming at legitimating their existence, gaining influence and sustaining social order. As the outcome of this research, we propose to expand upon the institutional change model of Greenwood et al. (2002). To do so, we suggested including a multi-level analysis (society, organisational field and organisation) and a new concept: “management tool” (Hatchuel and Weil, 1992). Empirically, this new framework challenges the notions of public, private, performance, and public service to prevent misconceptions limiting the significance of further research on the urban water sector. Finally, this PhD thesis warns against a focus on performance, which may divert from the essential and specific challenges of this sector."
"The aim of this thesis is to contribute on the current debate on the systemic risk and its policy implications for the implementation of new (systemic risk-based) capital requirements in the banking industry. We extend the existing literature in many aspects. In the first chapter, we investigate how bank charter value affects risk for a sample of OECD banks by using standalone and systemic risk measures before, during, and after the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. We revisit the self‐discipline role of charter value on bank’s risk-taking and systemic risk prior, during and after the crisis. We show that bank charter value is positively associated with risk-taking and systemic risk for very large “too-big-too-fail” banks and large U.S. and European banks prior to the crisis, but such a relationship is inverted during and after the crisis. Then, we deepen investigation on this relation between charter value and risk-taking and systemic risk prior to the crisis, regarding differences in risk taking cultures, bank size and bank strategies. The second chapter analyzes the dynamics of banks’ capital structure towards their desired and/or imposed capital level. It analyzes several interesting features. (i) whether or not market frictions and capital adjustment costs are larger for regulatory capital ratios vis-à-vis a plain leverage ratio. (ii) which adjustment channels banks use to adjust their capital ratio. (iii) how the speed of adjustment and adjustment channels differ between large, systemic and complex banks versus small banks. Findings suggest that banks are more flexible and faster in adjusting to their leverage capital ratio than to regulatory capital ratios. Whereas, systemically important banks are slower than other banks in adjusting to their target leverage ratio but quicker in reaching their target regulatory ratios.  Further explores show that SIFIs might be more reluctant to change their capital base by either issuing or repurchasing equity and prefer sharper downsizing or faster expansion. In the third chapter, we analyze how the international organization structure and the geographic expansion, of 105 European listed banks that have foreign affiliates around the world, could affect bank level measures of systemic risk during the 2005–2013 period. We also investigate how the peak of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the height of the European sovereign debt crisis of 2010–2011 might have affected such relationships. We find that internationalization and foreign complexity are important drivers of bank systemic risk, particularly during the 2008–2013 financial stress years."
"The major companies of the construction industry wish to integrate the concept of prevention within their organizations by seeking technical and organizational improvements and by implementing coercive or participatory methods whose goal is to deal with the human factor. This industry aims at controlling the risks inherent to the construction sites of which several classifications can be determined. Those classifications have in common their purpose, which is to draw up an exhaustive list from an infinite set according to variable criteria. After analyzing the different factors that influence the genesis of the risks in such a specific environment as the building sites, we propose a dynamic model for risk understanding and decision-making, based on the mobilization of the TNI and the Theory of social representations More specifically, considering the characteristics of the current emerging risks, we wonder about the relevance of the means implemented by the organization towards their integration."
"Little research has been done to date on French households’ preferences for energy retrofits in the dwelling. However, the economic role of these choices is crucial for implementing an effective and realistic energy policy in the residential sector, both in terms of proposed aid and targets. Are households interested in retrofits with high energy-savings potential? How much are they willing to pay and is it sufficient to cover the up-front costs? How many households have no choice of heating system, and what is their profile?This work sets out to answer these questions empirically using discrete choice models. It starts by analyzing the technical, socio-demographic and spatial constraints that face households and create barriers to domestic energy choices. A method to detect household constraint is devised and applied to the choice of space heating system in 2006 and 2013. The second stage analyzes household preferences for heating equipment and retrofits. This second part is based on a discrete choice experiment specially carried out for this research among 2,000 households. This work sheds light on households’ preferences and heterogeneity, as well as their willingness to pay, the implicit discount rate and other economic impacts."
"In a business world characterized by increasing complexity of technologies associated with the globalization of markets, technical knowledge and innovation become crucial assets and primary condition for developing competitive advantage. These issues are often associated with a particular figure within organizations: that of the expert. Indeed, these people are usually considered as a source of technological excellence and innovative solutions. It becomes thus crucial, in order to retain these key people, to value their expertise and to propose adequate conditions for the development of their knowledge and their innovation potential. As a response to this challenge, the dual ladder model was developed and has been soon recognized as a primary solution for the management of experts in the technological and industrial companies. This model proposes an alternative career path (technical ladder) to that of traditional managerial path. However, this solution, while a reference model in the management of experts, has not often brought satisfaction neither for those in charge of its implementation, nor for targeted individuals. Inspired by this paradox of the dual ladder model and building on the results of a longitudinal intervention-research, this thesis proposes a new problematization of the issue of expert’ management in organisations. We argue that not only the recognition policies for current experts should be taken into consideration, but also the issues of anticipation of future needs in expertise as well as the creation of new expertise areas. This thesis thus proposes an analytical framework that incorporates three lines of action: recognition policies for experts, strategic renewal of expertise and creation of new expertise domains. Each line is supported by the associated management tool, which was tested and validated in our fieldwork."
"We capture decision-making to voluntarily contribute to public good in small and large group, based on a Classic in experimental economics. Contrary to forecasts, decision-making is negatively correlated with Marginal Per Capita Return to investing in the public group in large group. Subjects appear to view the issue as weak. Decision-making is positively correlated, but too weakly, with number of subjects in small group and is not correlated in large group. Decision-making is always negatively correlated with game process, but without convergence to the dominant strategy. The method used in calculating compensation can have an impact. Reciprocity and aversion to inequity are always missing. This can be linked to the fact that subjects are not representative of the true population. In line with forecasts, two properties of public investment emerge and are consistent with decision-making of everyday life. Decision-making is negatively correlated with Marginal per Capita Return in small group, following logic of this incentive to contribute. There are signs of altruism in small group disappearing in larger group, disadvantaged by dilution of Giving. Presence of Warm-Glow Giving increases in large group, supported by changing nature of Giving. We model these results using the Logit equilibrium. It is noisy response functions including different components. Function’s properties properly meet decision-making  and have advantage of not modeling some empirical contradictions."
"Presented as an organization model to face globalization in the early 90’s by Bartlett & Ghoshal, The transnational has inspired lot of researchers.The problematic of this thesis aims to verify whether the transnational structure is an organization which fits firms only.With the help of a case study applied to a network structure “The catholic University of West Africa” and based on existing Theories in management and multinational governance, our work will attempt to test this hypothesis in an experimental research field in an African Context. This field is illustrated by a non-profit religious organization.The results allowed us to realize that the transnational model can be implemented in this kind of organization, but one should proceed step by step to achieve a global integration of all the operational and functional activities, starting by those alleged to be more relevant. The impact of religion and non-profit organization has been highlighted as factors playing a positive role in the studied cases."
"This thesis contributes to the literature on the impact of weather shocks on migration and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. The first chapter analyses whether Tanzanian rural households engage in internal migration as a response to weather-related shocks using an iv probit model. The findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. The second chapter paper attempts to establish if weather acts as the determinant of destination choice in the case of rural-to-rural migration. Employing the alternative-specific conditional logit model, this paper shows that an increase in the expected income differentials between origin and destination by 10,000 Tanzanian shillings, attributable to differences in weather, increases the probability of choosing a given destination by 2 percentage points. The third chapter analyses the food access dimension of food security, and models the link between weather shocks and food security that acts specifically through food prices. Employing an instrumental variable model where household dietary diversity is determined by food prices instrumented with weather shock, this chapter shows that a 1 per cent increase in local food prices induced by a weather shock decreases the number of food items consumed by households by around 2.5 per cent."
"In a market of life insurance in sub-Saharan Francophone behind, but with a bright future in the event of emergence of endogenous technical and commercial solutions, the thesis provides theoretical and operational tools adapted to its development. This approach is in parallel with actions taken by the supervisory authority regional (CIMA) to provide insurance tools in the region. Indeed, CIMA has initiated work to construct new tables regulatory experience, which has provided reliable and relevant references for mortality of the insured population in the region. However, some useful technical issues were not developed in such construction. The thesis then give them special attention. Thus, on the one hand, the theory can provide tools to account for differences in mortality between countries in the region, while limiting the risks associated with systematic sampling fluctuations (due to small sample sizes data countries). Particular, it appears that if the model independent of each country is not appropriate, models of heterogeneity with observable factors, such as the Cox or Lin and Ying model, can achieve this goal. However, it says here that these models of heterogeneity does not eliminate the systematic risk due to sampling fluctuations when estimating the model, they generate only a reduction of this risk in exchange for an increase in systematic risk associated the choice of model. On the other hand, the thesis can also provide tools to model future mortality experience in the region. In the absence of data on past trends in mortality experience, nor the classical Lee-Carter or its extensions are applicable. A solution based on a parametric adjustment, an assumption about the form of changes in the level of mortality (exponential or linear trend) and an expert opinion on the generational life expectancy at a given age is then proposed (this work based on the model of Bongaarts). Then in a second time, assuming availability of data on past trends (which for the record is not the case at this stage in the region, but should be in the coming years), the thesis proposes a model of future mortality from an external reference mortality and analyzes associated systematic risk (risk of sampling fluctuations and on the choice of the reference of mortality)"
"SME play a big role in the mexican economy and they are a source of local employment for the country. But their lifespan is threatened because they havedifficulties of being maintained in activity and to develop a social and economic performance opposite the increasingly larger requirements of competitiveness pulled by globalisation. However, one of their qualities and reflection is often accompanied by a family structure. The last aspect is not presenting advantages as for the attitude of the leaders and their mode of selection and training which does not privilege qualities as a negotiator.This often generates centralized structures not supporting research of consensus with the other actors of the company as well as participative behaviors so much individual which enters the groups. SME constitute the research field; because the paramount problem of SME is the absence of forecast on the future of the company. The owner-leader of SME is completely concentrated on the short-term operational activity, with the detriment of the activities with stronger added value and the strategic reflections, mainly on the development of the human resources because it constitutes a lever of socio-economicchanges for the future of the company. Our assumption of research consists in proposing ways of improvement of their level ofinternational competitiveness by the formulation of proactive strategies which willcause to reduce the hidden costs and to contribute to the socio-economic developmentof the organization. For the collection of data of research, we apply a methodology of research-intervention in three Mexican SME, starting from a scientific observation of management and cognitive interactivity enters the speaker-researcher and all the actors of theorganization including the owner-leader.The objective of the research-intervention, in the socio-economic theory is to generate amajor transformation as of the structures and behaviors of SME."
"Throughout the world globalisation exists as an everyday reality. Like many of our contemporaries, we are convinced that we are experiencing a completely new phenomenon. For the economic historian, talking about globalisation in the singular would mean ignoring all the others. It is not the purpose of this essay to deny the vigour of the current globalisation, but to grasp the size of a permanent phenomenon, which is now linked to containerisation. In fact, with the benefit of hindsight and a study of the past, we can understand better the current debates and possible future developments. But the future is largely determined by a certain number of change factors. If it is not possible to predict the final outcome of these changes, nonetheless, we can speculate on the way each might influence the future of the European economy, in general, and on the consequences which can result from the provision of containerised transport throughout Europe. Some of these factors can directly influence the strengths and weaknesses of the existing models; others can have indirect impacts.This thesis is an essay which is aimed at all the practitioners and university specialists interested in maritime trade. It is not a text about certitudes, nor a piece of condensed scholarship; the objective is neither to cover every aspect of maritime transport nor the economic history of Europe. Europe, which only represents 7% of the global land mass, is a peninsula bordered on three sides by the seas and does not have a neat geographical border on the fourth side separating it from the rest of the Eurasian continent. This geographical Europe has rarely coincided with an economic Europe. We must consider that the vast regions of east and south-east Europe were invaded and enslaved by non-European conquerors, and were liberated only after many centuries. In fact Europe has always had a variable geometry, which is normal, because, since ancient times it has been the result of all the different invasions and Eurasian trade. After the discovery of the American continent, Europeans developed commerce on a worldwide scale and imposed their hegemony until 1914. Spices and other oriental products were added to the products from the “East Indies”. This central position, obtained because of a demographic and technical superiority, stems from an economic and centralizing imperialism, challenged at the start of the 20th century and today largely condemned.With enormous transport capacities and very low costs, containerisation has accompanied globalisation for more than fifty years and has totally revolutionised the transport on regular lines of different merchandise. Henceforth, a permanent question about the globalisation of trade and navigation appears in different forms in this thesis; this is that access to the global market of Europe is certainly linked to the performance of European infrastructure but even more to global traffic. The future of Europe is inevitably linked to the Mediterranean and is thwarted by the “price scissors effect” which puts at risk the involvement of southern Mediterranean states in the process of globalisation. Europe has a major role to play in this region, but it does nearly nothing in response to the emergence of Asian and Latin American powers. If we wait for Europe to find its “road to Damascus”, there is a risk that by 2030 it will have lost its central role. On the other hand a reasonable prediction is that there will be a global system of trade and navigation centred on the Indian Ocean and the China seas, while European traffic gradually becomes peripheral to a new global containerised transport circulation."
"The first chapter presents Islamic finance, its principles, its products, its institutions. The second chapter presents a comparison between the two banking systems, Islamic and conventional through a study of banking ratios and principal component analysis. The third chapter aims to clarify the factors attracting customers towards Islamic banks and shows that they are not confined to religious criteria for their choice. The fourth chapter analyzes the intermediation margins of Islamic and conventional banks, using a dynamic approach of the panel (Arellano-Bond 1991). It concludes that Islamic banks are characterized by higher margins. The fifth chapter examines, for the two banking systems, the impact of regulatory pressure. It appears that Islamic and conventional banks operating in MENA are characterized by high capital levels which already well above the regulatory minimum, and therefore regulatory pressure has no impact on Islamic banks. This inefficiency of prudential regulation can be explained by the inadequacy of the regulations to the nature of the risk of these banks. The sixth and final chapter examines the relationship between capital and the risk of failure. It shows that, in MENA, the probability of failure is higher for Islamic banks."
"According to traditional financial theory, markets are deemed efficient and investors rational. They base the choice of their portfolios on well-defined financial parameters, following their own risk aversion. With the development of socially responsible investments (SRIs) in the middle of the 90s, a vast domain of research became available when selectingone’s portfolio. Indeed, investors integrate new elements which are out of the financial scope to their strategy of portfolio management, thus diverging from the traditional financial theory. The birth and development of this new type of investments has triggered the scientific community’s enthusiasm with more and more academic publications being written on the matter. Research has mostly tackled SRIs related to the main western marketplaces withdiverging results. The objective of this  thesis is to deepen the analysis of the financial behavior of these funds and socially responsible indicators from three emerging markets – South-Africa, Brazil and India – while taking into consideration the risks specific to thesemarketplaces and funds, and to appreciate their interest in terms of internationaldiversification of portfolios.This thesis is divided into four independent sections which follow a certain logic in writing and composition in order to answer our questions in the best way possible. The two first sections will introduce the subject and domain of this research. They will mostly deal with the theoretical aspect in order to conceptualize the research’s subject and put it into context.  The two following sections will focus on empirical analysis. SRIs will be analyzed as pure financial performances, but also as vectors of diversification for portfolios which is, to our knowledge, relatively absent from academic publications. Moreover, two scales were used for space and time, dividing the research according to the different phases of the 2008financial crisis and by analyzing performances following local and international dimensions. On the theoretical aspect, this study brings new elements concerning the comprehension of SRIs in a cross-cultural context, by questioning ethical perception, resulting financial strategies, and their economic impact. The empirical results have shown the financial interest for SRIs in these three markets in terms of performance and diversification of portfolios, from both a domestic and an international point of view."
"This thesis consists of four essays on applied production analysis, with a focus on technology, productivity and fixed costs. The aim of this thesis is to identify some limitations of recent contributions to production behavior modeling, and to propose improvements. In this dissertation, I compared different empirical specifications and statistical methods which have often been used in production analysis, and pointed out their implications for estimating technology parameters. I studied the causes and cures of endogeneity problems in the context of production analysis. This thesis also addressed the important but neglected issue of fixed costs. This work defined and characterized the fixed cost, and developed empirical strategies to estimate the fixed cost using the standard production database. Empirical evidence suggests that the fixed cost is significant and has profound impacts on producer’s behavior in terms of price setting, returns to scale and exports."
"Our research deals with the implementation of a professional gender equality program and is interested in the following question: how to lead an initiative of real and sustainable professional equality in a male environment? To answer it, we led a research-intervention within Transco, a group of public transport. ln our results, we propose a typology of major academic works on the professional equality and the organization. We test for the first time Rutherford's model, intended to characterize the gendered organizational culture. Then we display the specificities of Transco's equality initiative, and we link them to the literature to propose the key characteristics of gender initiatives. These results associated to our theoretical contributions allow us to draw operational recommendations to guarantee a real and sustainable equality between women and men."
"The purpose of this thesis was to test in laboratory the efficiency of two variants of the ambient tax (Average Pigovian Tax and Capped Ambient Tax) that present the advantage of reducing the financial burden imposed through taxation but whose efficiency requires that polluters coordinate their efforts. To enable this coordination, three types of communication (“cheap talk” or costless communication, exogenous costly communication and endogenous costly communication) are tested.The results show that the sucker’s payoff and the size of the groups are crucial in the potential of cheap talk to induce cooperation. When the communication is costly and exogenous, cooperation is limited in time. However when the decision to communicate for a price is up to the players, they decide not to communicate. We’ve also shown that cheap talk facilitates coordination towards the Pareto-dominant equilibrium and makes the Capped Ambient Tax efficient."
"Based on the idea that the subsidiaries of a company are able to call into question the decisions of senior management (the parent company), the holistic approach developed in this study assumes that an organization can be a “being”, implying thereby that the information in its possession is external to the individuals who compose it. This raises the question of whether it is conceivable to ignore the individual in such a relationship of domination. This thesis proposes a model based on the results which show the difficult exclusion of the individual in a meta-organizational context (in which members would be organizations and not individuals). Along these same lines, the organization’s human dynamics are at the heart of this research: there exists by and through the individual a dynamic resulting from actual activity that allows the organization to live by itself, while also allowing prescribe to evolve. Although the results show that the organization is not a dead and strengthless object, and it has the opportunity to live by itself, it is the individuals who —through their conditional commitments— allow the separate existence of an organizational structure’s intra-consciousness, which imposes rights and obligations. In this perspective, the proposed model aims to draw the structures of abstract social reality (referred as Entity X in this study) by showing the strengths and organizational constraints that weigh on individual members, while raising the human capacity to emerge from the structures prescribed by the sensemaking of links and transversal structures for cooperation that originate from the actual activity."
"Carrying out reforms entails a high level of risk for policy makers: reform failure can have far-reaching consequences on both the public policy concerned and the reputation of the political leaders who are pushing for the reform. Policy makers widely acknowledge the role of “political risk” in public decision making. However, its definition remains vague. A literature review in decision sciences, political science and political economy shows that the concept of political risk is a blind spot in academic theory. This research project aims to develop a better understanding of the reasons why some reform initiatives fail while others succeed. It defines political risk as a combination of risk factors which contribute to trigger disruptive events and, in turn, influence the enactment of reforms. Six risk factors are identified on the basis of more than forty reform case studies: intrinsic characteristics of the reform, public opinion, stakeholders, political context and socio-economic context. The concept of political risk is then operationalized and tested using a scorecard approach. The tests show a consistent relation between risk factors, disruptive events and reform enactment. This project contributes to a better understanding of the link between strategy and politics in decision making and the dynamics of strategic decision making in the public sector. It paves the way for a risk based approach to steering public policy reforms."
"This thesis studies the long-run relationship between gender equality and economic growth. In particular, it aims at understanding and explaining the mechanisms and determinants underpinning the development process which allowed economies to move out of a long period of stagnation into a state of sustainable economic growth. The scientific objective is to check the validity of the central hypothesis that improving equality between men and women is a key ingredient of the demographic transition and of the process of socio-economic development. Quantitative and empirical analysis of this relationship is based on a renewed cliometric approach. Hence we aim at producing a quantitative projection of social sciences in the past, structured by economic theory, mathematical modeling, and informed by statistical and econometric methods. The projected innovation is to build a bridge between the theoretical models of growth and economic history. This new line of research between pure empiricism and abstract theory allows to interpret economic issues taking into account the past and in so doing, to understand more deeply the economic and social historical processes."
"For decades, France has imposed quotas for Francophone music. Radio stations need to reserve a minimum percentage of total song plays for French-language songs since 1996. The development of streaming services, which faces no quotas, has changed how we listen to music and poses a new challenge to regulators. The applicability of quotas is increasingly difficult in the radio broadcasting industry and raises the question of competitive disadvantage. In this thesis, I try to answer three main issues on the topic of music consumption in this changing ecosystem. First, I empirically examine the strategic responses of French radio stations to quotas for Francophone music. Do stations comply with the quotas? Is the realized audience for Francophone music lower than it would be in the absence of these strategic responses?  To answer these questions, I use detailed data on the playlists of major radio stations in France to show that stations have some scope for adjusting their playlists subject to the quota constraints. Second, I build a dataset to provide some descriptive evidence on radio and streaming services. These are entirely different economic models, and are not comparable without adjusting the dataset to reflect the differences. In order to compare the audience number of music titles on radio stations with the number of streams on streaming services, I develop a methodology to combine radio data with streaming data in France in 2016. Third, using this novel dataset, I look at music consumption pattern and music variety on streaming services compares to that of radio. I also provide empirical evidence on the consumption externalities of both markets."
"Public action, like research, is becoming increasingly interested in the relationship between cities and energy. This thesis focuses on the ways in which energy network operators participate in the development and implementation of local energy policies and in the capacity of urban political stakeholders to drive these operators in this sense. The question is approached through local public utilities (LPU) as alternative energy distribution stakeholders in France. These companies have ensured supply and distribution of electricity and sometimes gas and heat in the areas where they are present for over one hundred years. They appear today to be innovative levers to action available to cities to develop urban energy policies. Centred on urban operators, this thesis examines the cases of GEG in Grenoble and UEM in Metz. Despite their local roots, LPUs have only in recent years granted an important place in their business strategies to the urban scale. The sectoral and centralised organisation of the electricity public services have for a long time limited the capacities of the LPUs, impeding the emergence of approaches specific to their particular areas. Reconfigurations of the economic model which impose liberalisation cause the ELDs to constantly search for new growth sources. Seizing opportunities from emerging energy-climate policies, they are proving their great adaptability and have devised new strategies valorising to a greater extent their urban roots. These urban roots alone are not enough to make the LPUs governmental tools for urban energy policy, which supposes a capacity for initiative and control by the political stakeholders of their own objectives. Through analysis of the Grenoble and Metz examples, we demonstrate that presenting energy as a local political issue is both progressive and heterogeneous, calling into question an approach to LPU control which until now has been essentially economic and industrial. Politicisation is being hindered by the lack of energy expertise in the communes, which only very infrequently manage to integrate their energy-climate concerns into strategic plans for their local businesses. In contrast, changes in operational plans are much greater in projects which involve partnerships around energy issues: regional climate-energy plans, responses to national and European calls for public tenders, coordination of distribution networks…The analysis of an alternative regional energy model from the LPUs proposed in this thesis demonstrates that the local status of operators is insufficient for the development of urban energy governance, which also operates in the politicisation of energy issues and the development of specially adapted expertise within urban political and administrative systems"
"Global environmental change (GEC) in the ocean threatens marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them. A growing scientific effort is attempting to evaluate the impacts of environmental changes on ecosystems and ecosystem services and guide policy-making to respond to this global issue. Focusing on social-ecological systems of coral reefs, this thesis critically reviews the approaches put forward in the literature to understand gaps and to design new methodologies, assessments, and indicators to guide science and policy. Our findings show that a regionally targeted strategy of research should address complexity and provide more realistic projections about the impacts of GEC on coral reefs ecosystems and ecosystem services. We map global-scale indicators to understand where human dependence on coral reef ecosystems will be affected by globally-driven threats expected in a high-CO2 world. We then analyze how science is responding to the challenge posed by GEC on coral reefs and to identify gaps in research.Finally, we attempt to operationalize an overlooked component of vulnerability assessments, ecological adaptive capacity, to serve as a tool to help assess where local actions can be effective in the context of climate change. This manuscript contributes to theoretical and methodological advances to evaluate impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to GEC. It develops interdisciplinary approaches for the study of social-ecological systems and ecosystem services, targeting coral reefs as a case study. Finally, it synthesizes critically the emergence of a scientific field on solutions to GEC for coral reef social-ecological systems."
"Our case study based on an exploratory entity evolving from a small team to a business unit raise questions related to the identification and structuration of an innovation field. The literature gives few elements with regards to the choice of such a field, and the mechanisms to set priorities within a chosen field. Our results related to innovation processes show that exploratory activities leads to a renewal of exploitation, and also that the difficulties encountered by NCA in exploration activities are less related to the existing processes than to the choice of an innovation field. Our results related to organization show that NCA works in a mode of simultaneous ambidexterity, being able at the same time to launch new product categories and to explore new product categories. This also leads to the renewal of existing routines. The structure of NCA has also some original features, being at the same time a business unit and an exploratory entity. This exploratory business unit seems to be able to launch more easily new products categories, because there is no need to look for a landing zone, as it is the case of organisations solely responsible for exploration."
"This research aims the exploration the relationship between creativity-organisation in the particular context of creative industries. To do so, we tried to answer the following research question: how do communication agencies manage creation projects since creativity is the hearts of these projects? To address the research question, we conducted a multiple case study on eight communications agencies through a qualitative approach. Previous works on creativity in organizations highlight the influence of organizational factors on the creativity of individuals and workgroups. The current research highlights the enactment role of creative actions on established organizations.The results of this research support earlier works showing the influence of factors of the working environment on individual and workgroup. In addition, the results highlight the influence of creativity on the established organization by generating changes in the existing routines and processes.This leads us to believe that more should be done in examining the underlying mechanisms mobilized by creativity leading to introduce organizational changes and the context that enable these mechanisms to happen."
"Tourism has become a social, cultural and economic phenomenon. However, the impact of tourism on a long-term economy growth remains ambiguous, especially for small island economies (SIE).This thesis seeks to identify the fundamentals of tourism specialization as a sustainable source of growth for a SIE. On the one hand, it has led us to redefine the main components of tourism as a social and economic activity and to clarify how tourism contributes to the economic growth. On the other hand, this thesis reveals the ambiguity of the relationship between tourism and growth. It provides new explanations for a more virtuous tourism growth model and more adapted to the global tourism market.The results of the introduction of tourism into a Romer's model of endogenous growth and those of a threshold regression model applied to a sample of SEI call into question the hypothesis of linearity between tourist specialization and economic growth. The thesis demonstrates the end of a model of intensive tourist development. It concludes that tourism is a sustainable source of growth for an SIE, when intelligence and agility constitute the leitmotif of a sustainable, multi-stakeholder tourism strategy."
"Credit scoring is generally considered as a method of evaluation of a risk associated with a potential loan applicant. This method involves the use of different statistical techniques to determine a scoring model. Like any statistical model, scoring model is based on historical data to help predict the creditworthiness of applicants. Financial institutions use this model to assign each applicant to the appropriate category : Good payer or Bad payer. The only data used to build the scoring model are related to the accepted applicants in which the predicted variable is known. The method has the drawback of not estimating the probability of default for refused applicants which means that the results are biased when the model is build on only the accepted data set. We try, in this work using the reject inference, to solve the problem of selection bias, by reintegrate reject applicants in the process of granting credit. We use and compare different methods of reject inference, classical methods and  semi supervised methods, we adapt some of them to our problem and show, on a real dataset, using ROC curves, that the semi-supervised methods give good results and are better than classical methods. We confirmed our results by simulation."
"This thesis was explores and analyses at organisational level:- the fact that certain technologies – however seductive and useful they are – intrude in our lives (intrusion and/or voluntary immersion) or are imposed on us without debate or criticism by market players and produce new forms of life : this is technological blindness; - the fact that while the political system should regulate and control, market forces dominate through new forms or centres of power ; globalisation and the financialised economy are manifestations of another type of blindness :  liberalist blindness. Do these two types of blindness have analogies, particular features, links and interactions within organisations? If so, might this generate a phenomenon that has hardly been identified or studied : organisational blindness? My doctoral work answers these two questions in the affirmative."
"The ""managerial discourse"" is today omnipresent in the life of corporation, as well as within organizations and in everyday life of individuals. The aim of this PhD is to describe the conditions of emergence of a new kind of rationality, as well as its ways of transformation. Firstly, the ""managerial discourse"" stems from the management sciences, which irrupted at the beginning of the 20th century, composed by part of military principles, as well as notions of engineering, biology and social sciences. What we called ""visibilities"" (term coined by the work of the historian Alfred D. Chandler) enable a ""managerial discourse"" to streamline normatively the enterprise, its techniques and its human actions related. In that way, rationality had been analyzed as an ""ideology"" by Reinhard Bendix, but furtherly viewed as a plurality of discourses that are continuously evolving. Prolonging the work of Luc Boltanski and Eve Chiapello, we are describing how the body of doctrine concerning ""managerial discourse"" has been transformed from the 1960’ to the 1990’; we have extended this analysis with a new corpus of managerial literature of the 2010’. Our semantic analysis – over 100 years of specialized literature (from pionniers to actual vision) – highlights the displacements of meaning over time while restoring its unity with the support of a what we call ""grammar of the managerial discourse"". Basically, the company had General Motors for model in the 1960’, then in the 1990’ it was Toyota, and Google nowadays. Similarly, concepts are reshuffled : the focus on ""planning"" moved into ""networks"" and then ""collaborations""; The ""delegation"" moved into ""leadership"" and then ""liberation""; focus were on ""programs"", after on ""projects"" and now on ""data"". However, our PhD shows how ""managerial discourse"" remains structured around the notion of ""grammar"". This consists of a ""synoptic visibility"" (ie the overall representation of the company), a ""visibility of the measure"" (ie the calculation of the work activity), a ""visibility of the delegation"" (ie control of the activity of others), and a ""visibility of the commercialization"" (ie the definition of the company from outside). The ""managerial discourse"" is powered firstly by its adaptability to any change, with the help of its ""grammar"" defined in this thesis."
"These last years, Algeria began an ambitious national plan on housing construction of all types. For example, 1,6 million homes are registered for realization under the five-year period 2015-2019. However and due to lack of skilled labor, companies in charge to build these homes used a workforce from abroad: China, Japan, Spain, Egypt, etc. In front of this situation, it was noticed that the sector of building and public works currently represents about a third of occupational accidents and professional diseases at national scale. However, no indication is provided on the question of emergence of psychosocial risks due to the organization of work. This is why a study was initiated in this direction, of whom the realization of a doctoral thesis in France. This thesis thus consists in acquiring theories on psychosocial risks and those of organizations. To do this, it was necessary in particular to put the accent on history of these risks in Europe and especially in France, the agenda setting on the emergence of psychosocial risks, particularly via the case of suicides and suicide attempts at France Télécom. In this wake and dig on this question, we put two hypotheses of worsening of psychosocial risks. Firstly, psychosocial risks aggravate by imbalance between regulation of control (managerial) too high, and autonomous regulation (by workers who organize their activity of the way which seems the best indicated) in reference to the theory of J.D. Reynaud. In the second place, psychosocial risks aggravate by deficit of organizational democracy of participative form, which joins and completes the first hypothesis. That being said, we indicate that the chapter that we devoted to epistemology (six schemes of intelligibility of J.M. Berthelot, which were taken, amended and operationalized by Pascale De Rozario within the framework of the study of the phenomenon of suicide) allowed us to make the inventory of theories dedicated to psychosocial risks and to evaluate them taking into consideration model which they carry on the relation between organization and individual.It should also be noted that we opted for a constructivist approach, object of the last chapter of the thesis. While starting initially with a top-down approach; we took our review of theoretical literature (J.D. Reynaud, Marie-Hélène Bacqué, Yves Sintomer and others authors) and we confronted it with a practical and managerial review of 4 observatories (observatories analyzed with regard to the contents on diffused psychosocial risks and in the manners of which they diffuse, interpret, clarify the reports between psychosocial risks, organization and managerial regulation of the activity) and then we followed a bottom-up approach. And It's at this moment there that we made constructivism. This last chapter represents our theoretical, methodological and operational proposal once return in Algeria to initiate a national public policy of sensitizing, management and prevention of psychosocial risks, in particular with through the implementation of an observatory of psychosocial risks adapted to the sector of building and public works."
"The study of high organizational reliability refers to the examination of conditions that allow a complex organized system to maintain high levels of reliability consistent with both security and economic requirements. Studies on the functioning of High Reliability Organizations (HRO) feature a set of practices and mechanisms implemented within these organizations - at the individual, group and organizational levels - which enable them to manage and operate effectively complex technicalsystems at risk. In line with the contributions on what contribute to high reliability in such companies, this work aims to demonstrate the consideration of disorder, as one of the organizational logics, supporting reliability of the company. In this sense, a conceptualization of disorder as an organizing component (organizational disorder) is proposed. As a result of this conceptualization, the thesis demonstrates to what extent organizational disorder, through the establishment ofinformal organizations stratified on the existing formal ones, can reduce and limit the effects of disruptions. Disorder is analyzed as an intrinsic catalyst of sensemaking, partaking to high reliability. By discussing the consideration of disorder as the very essence of the organization, the thesis also debates upon the underlying normative approach in the very conception of the organization and its ensuant high reliability."
"This thesis focuses on the strategic asset allocation models and on their application for the financial reserve management of a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) retirement schemes, especially those with partial provision. The study of the reserve utility for a PAYG system and of their management still leaves a lot to be explored. Classical hypothesis are usually considered too restrictive for the description of the complex reserve evolution. New models and new results have been developed over three levels : economic scenario generation (ESG), numerical optimization techniques and the choice of optimal strategic asset allocation in the case of an Asset-Liability Management (ALM). For the generation of financial and economic scenarios, some ESG performance indicators have been studied. Also, we detailed and proposed to improve ESG construction, notably the choice of the correlation matrix between modelled variables. Then, a set of tools were presented so that we could estimate ESG parameters variety. This thesis has also paid particular attention to numerical techniques of optimum research, which is an important step for the asset allocation implementation. We developed a reflexion about a global optimisation algorithm of a non convex and a noisy function. The algorithm allows for simple modulating, through two parameters, the reiteration of evaluations at an observed point or the exploration of the noisy function at a new unobserved point. Then, we presented new ALM techniques based on stochastic programming. An application to the strategic asset allocation of a retirement scheme with partial provision is developed. A specific methodology for the scenario tree generation was proposed at this level. Finally, a comparative study between proposed ALM model and Fixed-Mix strategy based model was achieved. We also made a variety of a sensitivity tests to detect the impact of the input values changes on the output results, provided by our ALM model"
"The research focuses on professional ethos recognition of associative coordinators placed in a position of volunteers’ accompaniment. It mobilizes a theoretical framework that articulates work on emergent professionalism (Jorro, 2011) and professional ethos (Jorro, 2009; 2010) with communities of practice theory (Wenger, 2005). The research methodology is based on elicitation interviews (Vermersch 1994) and ‘decryption of meaning interviews’ (Faingold, 1998) to access to ‘acted out values’ ​​that specify commitment in a cultural practice (Billett, 2008). The results reveal an emergent employee/volunteers learning community accompanying professional ethos construction while questioning the formalization of its recognition (Belair, 2009). These research results provide lines of thought that can contribute to the professional development of associative actors."
"This thesis examines the business creation process (BCP) and successful practices reasoning effectuation (effectual logic) combined or not with the reasoning by causation - causal logic of the theory of ""cause and effect"" among entrepreneurs. From our research question: how do you create a successful business and how it solves-critical incidents related to business creation, we study the steps that entrepreneurs have used in 10th arrondissement of Paris to identify socioeconomic data and unpublished resources and territorial characteristics such as contingencies to succeed in business creation process (BCP). Our research problem leads actually in a logical continuum seeking to understand the processes that followed the activity creating successful projects and the methods of resolution of critical incidents related to business creation.By incident means a difficulty (by extension a problem, an obstacle) that occurs during the project creation and whose consequences can be critical or severe if it is not resolved by the creators of activities. The critical nature (or severe) here refers to what is not in their routine. This means that such an incident can result in the abandonment of the creative process in progress or slow down or lead to its cessation. Therefore, we can assume that their occurrence may be related to the context of the territory (eg, institutional factors or structural conditions of the installation place), type of resources mobilized in question or to the tools and methods used.To answer this research question we selected three research hypothesis, namely: The H1 hypothesis that matches causation (described as dominant approach in enterprise environments creators) where it assumes that the entrepreneur succeeds its business creation process (BCP) it is well trained in the business schools with the right tools (business model) and the right methods (value analysis) that simply replicate or duplicate in any context regardless of situations or contingencies favorable or not. Otherwise if it is sufficiently trained and qualifed in academic circles. Next comes the H2 hypothesis effectuation that weakens or caricature H1 should we consider this time that the entrepreneur succeeds his (BCP) if he can build a situation of unusual or unexpected opportunity of made specific qualities of its own such as charisma, personality and rival individual capacities (that is to say almost unequal individual capacities in nature). These two hypotheses H1 and H2 are based on the work of Sarasvathy (publication 2001c, a, b and following year). Finally comes the hypothesis 3 which is involved in this tension between H1 and H2 for their questioning. For hypothesis 3 (Territory) the entrepreneur succeeds his (BCP) when it can integrate into its business plan to create the role of territory with facilitative resources (not binding). In other words, an institutional framework enabling or facilitating of devices such as policy development and promotion of entrepreneurship on the territory or in the place of installation of these activities. And in this case for H3, training and entrepreneur's qualifications (H1), charisma and personality (H2) is irrelevant."
"This research challenges Integrated Reporting usefulness as a new internal management control system. A review of existing management control tools has enabled to characterize useful management control tools attributes. First part of this research has been dedicated to test theoretically Integrated Reporting. In-depth analysis of IIRC Framework shows IR possesses theoretically those attributes. But this theoretical adherence is not sufficient: IR needs to be set up at the heart of a technical and organisational system. Guided by systems modelling approach, second step has been the identification of conditions allowing reception and effective usage of IR at the heart of the system. An explanatory survey conducted among about thirty listed companies has been realized to test those conditions on think, build and run phases. But this survey has overall dedicated to debate IR usefulness, on the basis of attributes previously characterized. Results can be read at two levels: first level shows that IR actually meets expectations in terms of management control effectiveness. Second level reveals more strong belief than strong usefulness in many organisations. Verbatim also shows that IR is more dedicated to global decision-makers than local decision-makers."
"This thesis analyzes the determinants and the implications of innovation while highlighting the complementarity between technological and organizational competencies and their accumulation in time. Our econometric study is based on the data of three waves of French CIS (1998-2006). Firstly, our results suggest that the innovation is determined by the company’s internal and external characteristics. Moreover, the complementarity tests showed that in order to profit fully from the positive effect of the partnership and the R & D efforts on innovation, those must be accompanied by an organizational architecture supporting the knowledge creation and distribution. Secondly, our results show that especially process, organizational and marketing innovations have positive significant effects on the French companies’ productivity. Besides, product and process innovations promote more productivity if they are accompanied by organizational and marketing innovations and vice versa. Thirdly, we underlined a strong persistence of the innovation’s inputs and outputs which calls specific incentives to the no innovating companies. Our results suggest also that to accelerate the installation of their innovations, the firms are invited to interiorize their R & D activities rather than to outsource them. Finally, we proved that the innovating projects require time to generate productivity gains. This shift of output must be taken into account while preparing the financing plans."
"This thesis brings precisions on the measure of the emissions reduction potential in cities and the cost of electric vehicle by taking into account users driving patterns. Studies on electric vehicles or other solutions belonging to the ""technological lever"" compute emissions reduction potential and cost without discerning the local specificities of the areas where it would be used and the use that would be done of these vehicles. These studies don't take into account the other policies implemented in the area, including the ones that operate on a different lever such as the ""mobility structure lever"" : volume of activity and modal shares. Policies for reducing CO$_2$ emissions are often discussed independently and ignore the possible retroactions. To improve the evaluation of the potential of the electric vehicle, it seems essential to take into account the environment in which it would be developed. We use a urban economics model to first look at the spatial features of the city, and so at the use of this vehicle. Then we compute the impacts of the simultaneous introduction of the electric vehicle and a solution belonging to the ""mobility structure lever"" : the greenbelt. These two last points allow us to highlight the interdependency of the two action levers : technology and mobility structure. Then we take into account the use of the car by the households and the uncertainty around electric vehicle introduction, to improve the evaluation of the cost of this solution"
"The purpose of this thesis is to make both a theoretical and operational contribution, concerning the measure of the lived experience as a key factor to an effective customer experience management.Based on practice, our approach relies on research from different academic fields: economics and service management, quality management, strategy, marketing, performance management and organizational learning.The customer experience management model we offer has four interacting dimension: intended experience (by the managers), expected experience (by the customers), offered experience (by the company), lived experience (by the customers).Our research proposals are concerned with measuring the differences between the lived experience and the other dimensions. The issue is not only a description of the gaps that may exist between the objectives, referring to the espoused theory in customer experience (eg what is the experience we want to create for our clients?) and the customer’s perception of the achievements, referring to the theory-in-use of the company (eg what is the experience actually offered and how do customers perceive it?). The intention is to also examine how companies can reduce such gaps by engaging in a process of organizational learning leading to a successful customer experience management."
"The classical model of finance (Markowitz, Sharpe, Black, Scholes, Fama) has, from the be-ginning, been challenged by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010). It shows that the normal distribution does not match the reality of the market, because it underesti-mates the extreme risks. Instead, we must use the power laws, such as the Pareto law. We show the implications of this fundamental change in the finance, but also in the manage-ment of companies (through the calculation of cost of capital). We try to update the underly-ing reasons for the existence of power laws in economics through the concept of entropy. We present new theoretical tools to understand price formation (the theory of diagonal proportion), bubbles (the notion of reflexivity), crisis (network concept), providing a com-prehensive response to the current crisis (a diversified monetary system). All these ways are very little or not at all exploited. They are mostly for the first time, made consistent around the notion of power law. This is a new way of understanding economic phenomena present-ed here."
"Globalization, time to market, and customer responsiveness present continuous challenges for achieving market innovation across cultures. A cross-cultural and networked business environment has created increased demand for knowledge-sharing within the multinational corporation (MNC). The inability of geographically distributed team members to effectively share and communicate ideas and solutions can result in a lack of product innovation, delayed product introductions, and reduced sales and market opportunities. This requires managers to leverage cross-cultural team knowledge in order to improve the design and delivery of innovative customer solutions worldwide. This dissertation thus intends to examine and identify organizational mechanisms that facilitate cross-cultural collaboration and knowledge-sharing for geographically distributed teams responsible for the front end of innovation.The resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm inform this dissertation where integrated cognitive and social practices serve an important role for innovation. Through qualitative research, I will examine organizational mechanisms that influence interactions between the project leader and the geographically distributed team during global product launches, from product concept to market introduction. Since there is a lack of empirical research conducted with organizations on cross-cultural collaboration and global innovation, there is a significant opportunity to advance research within innovation management while assisting organizations in the development of knowledge-sharing capabilities that serve as competitive advantage in conceiving and introducing new products to international markets.The purpose of this dissertation research is to investigate and demonstrate how MNCs can facilitate the cross-cultural collaboration process in order to effectively conceive and execute innovation strategies for new products. The research intends to develop a framework and model for cross-cultural team collaboration in exploring and responding to the following research question: How can MNCs optimize cross-cultural team collaboration in order to strengthen the planning and execution of global innovation strategies? This research responds to organizational needs for sharing knowledge amongst cross-cultural teams in order to accelerate responsiveness to international market opportunities."
"The motivation of employees is vital necessity to the success of the enterprise, especially in the context of global economic crisis. By understanding what motivates their members, directors can mobilize and realize the full potential of each person and direct their energies more effectively. The renewal of sources of motivation asks that analyze in advance the changes currently affecting the world of working and their consequences. The objective of this thesis is to help people manage human resources (in the enterprise) to understand what and how to create conditions favor the employee motivation, how to orientate, to improve and to maintain the motivation of its employees and how to construct appropriate motivational strategies in the management. In addition, for this aim, in favorite of promoting the motivation and stimulating the employees, we try to propose to establish a dynamic environment in Chinese enterprises."
"The French wine industry has been facing a recession for a long period, on its domestic market. Main reasons are sociological, cultural and not only economical. Simultaneously this industry has to maintain its position on the international markets where a growth in consumption can be observed and also a more intense competition due to actors coming from the new world. In front of these evolutions, the understanding of the consumer and of the different actors on this industry but also of the used marketing tools has to be questioned and explored. The aim of our ""thèse sur travaux"", is to describe the evolution of the wine industry and to present a trend to economic de individuation in this sector. The individuation principle, a psychological concept at the origin, expresses the idea that each person is differentiated from others. In the managerial context, individuation can be perceived first thanks to the study of the consumer through his waiting's, needs and his behaviour during the purchasing experience, second with the analysis of the offers' behaviour, here particularly the wine merchants in their strategy, their financial structure and the promotional tools they use, and third with the choices made for the wine industry governance by public regulators and administrative boards of the different wine regions. In the contrary, the economic de individuation expresses behaviours of all the stakeholders of the domain, desiring to reduce their individual and differentiate character.    In order to present the economic de individuation in the wine industry, our research will be based on a series of previous publications conducted in three domains: first, analysing the wine consumer in the context of postmodernism thanks to the observation of their experience and associated representations. Second, observing a sample of French wine merchants, the disparities and similarities of their financial structures and strategies particularly as explanation of their export performance. Third, studying the marketing tools used in this industry. The wine branding activity whose standardization power is well-known is above all developed. Our contributions provide theoretical background with consumer behaviour and contemporaneous forms of the firms' governance issues. For the wine industry, our investigations contribute to a prospective vision of the domain, in order to elaborate scenarios for the future, but also for managers of the concerned firms for their operational decisions."
"Several studies have helped to characterize the role of cognitive biases, which appear in situations of creativity. Among these cognitive biases, we can particularly distinguish the fixation effects, that is to say, the obvious knowledge and solutions that comes spontaneously in individuals’ mind during a situation of creativity (creativity task, idea generation, or creative problem-solving), and which consequently constrain the generation of novel and creative ideas and solutions. These different studies open new sights to enrich the management of these cognitive biases in innovation processes.Leadership is recognized as having a fundamental role to play in helping a team overcome these fixation effects in an ecosystem in situation of creativity. Leadership is commonly defined as a process of social influence, in which one or more actors (acting as leaders), lead other actors (their teams) to achieve a common goal. Leadership and creativity are often seen as antagonistic – whether leaders are « creative » in the place of their teams, or that the authority and control must disappear in order for creativity of their teams to flourish.In a multidisciplinary research framework combining management science (innovation management), cognitive science (cognitive biases to creativity) and innovative design science (C-K theory), creative leaders can play very important roles to help their teams overcome fixation effects, and this according to very precise and controlled experimental rules, consisting on the one hand to detect the cognitive biases against creativity (the fixation), and on the other hand to undertake the appropriate modes of actions to overcome them.In addition, these experimental rules can be contextualized in more general conditions, such as organizational contexts, using traditional leadership organizational tools (recruitment, resources and time allocations, motivation, decision-making, evaluation, climate creation, goal-settings, etc..). Indeed, the research methods used for this organizational contextualization of the defixation rules consist of i) building experimental protocols in order to isolate the cognitive effects related to the fixation effects in situations of creativity; ii) generating experimental rules of cognitive defixation in highly and well-controlled contexts (laboratory settings); and iii) contextualizing these experimental rules for cognitive defixation using biographical studies of great creative and innovative leaders in the history, such as for example: Steve Jobs, Thomas Edison or Mark Zuckerberg."

"Urban sprawl is a major environmental and socioeconomic issue. Many public policies are designed to limit the excessive urbanization that occurs around large European and North-American urban areas. In order to address the urban sprawl issue correctly, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms driving households’ residential location choices. Indeed, in Europe, between 2000 and 2006, nearly half of the artificialized land was dedicated to residential use. More than three quarters of this land-use change occurred on farmland. The purpose of this work is to provide a strong theoretical framework which would allow giving keys for better understanding of the economic mechanisms involved in residential location choice on the one hand, and agricultural externalities on the other. We use the static model of the monocentric city, developed by urban economy. Our theoretical models allow us to highlight various results. A sufficient supply of agricultural amenities may drive households to locate further away from the city where they work, but nearer to a bettervalued life environment. We show that, under certain conditions, fragmented urban development may naturally occur in any city surrounded by heterogeneous agriculture. We also show that the introduction of an agri-environmental policy promoting the provision of agricultural positive externalities may indirectly affect households’ residential location choices. Therefore, any public policy that is likely to influence characteristics of the suburban area has to deal with a holistic approach, taking into account its many drivers"
"In science-based industries, the pace of innovation is characterized by accelerated renewal of products and the destabilization of dominant designs. In this context of intensive innovation, industrial organizations have to develop new breakthrough innovation capabilities to organize the emergence of new technological expertise allowing the innovative design of new products and technologies.Paradoxically, expertise and innovation issues can sometimes seem to be in opposition or at least in tension. Expertise seems to preserve the dominant designs, but it also allows the generation of conceptual expansion. Behind this aporia, there are crucial questions about the contemporary management of the emergence of expertise in science-based organizations in a situation of intensive innovation.From on an exploratory approach based on a longitudinal case study at STMicroelectronics, this thesis focuses on governance models for the emergence of expertise in science-based organizations. Based on an empirical analysis carried out by STMicroelectronics, this work shows that the emergence of new expertise is effected by a reorganization and a profound restructuring of the expertise structures. In other words, new areas of expertise emerge from the reconfiguration of interdependent relationships between existing areas of expertise.Moreover, this research suggests a formal model for the emergence of expertise in science-based organizations. This model allows to identify new managerial challenges and to highlight organizational models to support these expertise emergence forms. Then, new management solutions are tested and analyzed at STMicroelectronics. Finally, the thesis analyses scientific experts’ roles and missions in the innovation strategies within science- based organizations."
"The main question of this thesis can be formulated as follows: How can discourses, norms and spatial practices, in the context of inter-organisational relations, produce good spatial conduct of agents in a relation of delegation? Rooted in strategic management, our theoretical framework mobilise approaches from the domain of geography and the Foucauldian notion of dispositif. The methodology we used is based on a unique case study: the health system in the region of Centre-Valde- Loire. The analysis of the empirical material shows the creation of an inter-organisational self-regulation chain, enabling the dissemination of this dispositif based on three types of space (absolute, relative and relational) by giving the illusion to each one of these links that he is responsible for his actions. We also highlight the independent nature of the dispositif that can create room for manoeuvre for actors as well as results that are sometimes counter-productive with regard to the original policies of the mandator."
In this thesis based on works the author goes from two previous studies on the profitability of loyalty and customer potential determination to make a statement : part of the profitability of loyalty and of the potential for a brand is based on the reachable share of turnover done by the competition ; the catch rate.In this new work it is shown that the catch rate is based on the elasticity of the share of category requirement. From a review of the literature and several modeling on scanning panel data the author demonstrates on several markets that elasticity of the share of category requirement is limited and predictable.Then it’s in taking into account this small difference that a brand can estimate the “catchable” rate and therefore the profitability of loyalty and potential of a customer.
"This research has as objective to study the problematic of the organizational transformation in the context of the public organizations in Lebanon. It is more particularly about the improvement of the quality of public services in the public organizations. The quality is the spearhead of the strategy of the development of users’ satisfaction. Nowadays, the topic of the quality in the public management is particularly severe. We can emphasize that the public organizations are moving towards to satisfy more the users, which becomes one of the most important objectives within these organizations.This research shows that the theoretical and methodological scope of the socioeconomic analysis has contributed to improve the functioning of the organizations. The instructions that we formulate are stated on the basis of the notions of the “services quality”, of the “organizational transformation” and of the “users’ satisfaction”. The model of the suggested intervention by this approach does not consist anymore of seizing the quality on the basis of the goals to reach and to obtain from the required transformations, but to define the conditions of change possibility, and to lead the transformations of the management and of the functioning of the organization, in its infrastructures, which will permit to reach the goals or to perform a policy of a bigger satisfaction of the user.Our contribution, which is mostly exploratory, permits to prescribe the adaptations to be realized as regards to the management and functioning of public organizations. Our objective will be to formulate suggestions for the setting of a socioeconomic management system aiming at reducing the malfunctioning, controlling the quality, and at the permanent adaptation of the structures of a public organization."
"The territory is brought into the public debate since the eighties associated with the implementation of decentralization policies. However, since the nineties, public policy changes have given rise to a territory sometimes support, sometimes streamlining tool of collective action at the local level. The territory is seen as a construction (Gosse and Sprimont, 2008) under which the use of multiple actors with diverse legitimacy or sometimes potential conflict (Mendez and Mercier, 2006) is a challenge for collective action territorialized. Thus, the prevalence of an actantial reading of territory leads to an interpenetration of action spaces of intersecting economic issues (with employment as special purpose), political (distribution of powers to local space) and organizational (search for optimal coordination).It follows that a form of hybridization [Berthet et al, 2002] is built as a model for the conduct of collective territorialized action by inviting to a combined action private and public actors, with governance as a method of driving and managing territorialized resources. Looking for an “effective” territory through the use of management tools updates the territorial issue in the context of complexity of a complexification of democracy and of a performative target of public action. As such, the territory project is one of the emblematic instruments of territorial actors mobilization research and of democracy strengthening in a newly decentralized republic. The company is also at the center of stakeholders, invited on the territorial scene.This assumed interweaving between management and policy, illustrates itself by the call for management as ""natural ally"" in order to mobilize the actors many called. There remains that a conceptual approach that transposes management at the territorial level, highlights specifies and, critical points. Thus, management as a collective territorialized action lever, fits into paradoxical records that impede the compatibility between management and policy spaces.Drawing on the example of Guadeloupe and using the sociology of translation, we seek to show how the project can be posited as an mobilization instrument and deploy itself in a non-hierarchical framework."
"The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the squares scope of the cultural dimension towards the phenomenon of strategic alignment of IS- subtlety insufficiently analyzed- even to include in depth the impact that can practice the organizational culture on the strategic alignment of ERP system usages, in particular during the post go-live step.A theoretical exploration, relevant to our scientific questioning, appeared to us as indispensable prerequisite to constitute at the same time the foundation and the justification of the proposed modeling. Which was probation of the professional reality with a selection of companies operating in Tunisia and being in the phase of the post go-live of their ERP systems. Making it, it seemed to us more constructive to adopt the qualitative/quantitative complementarity of both approaches at the level of our empirical approach, and it within the framework of a methodological triangulation. Our investigation took place in two waves. During the first one, 5 case studies were led from 16 semi-directive interviews with General Manager, Operational/Functional Director and IS Director involved in the strategic alignment of ERP system usages. Based on the results of the analysis conducted by the contents of the interviews, a survey by questionnaire was administered in the second phase with 55 Operational/Functional Director recovering from 22 companies.The diversity of the obtained results confirming at the same time the feasibility and the validation of the modeling research and tends to demonstrate the peculiarity of our reflection in which the main contribution lies in the emergence of an innovative culturalist hypothesis. Which applies the importance of taking into consideration of the organizational culture as stimulating potential of the strategic alignment of ERP system usages, the referee so at the managerial need concerning the control of the strategic alignment of the uses during the post go-live step."
"The object of this thesis is to understand the governability of various modes of organization (as network), within institutions by a hypothetical model of governance, and through which we shall try to give the sense of the organized action in the framework of both hermeneutic circularity and the criticism of ideology and of utopia. This framework will stage the potential of stakeholder. So, the pragmatism option gives the sense by including this hypothetic model of governance within governmentality and sovereignty concepts, to bound and offers a dynamic sense which generate the news hypothesis, as well the importance of the social capital, the codification, the abstraction, the consensus, as the consent through  which we will reveal the different  aspects of their potentiality . These variables will transform the hypothetic model in to efficient dynamic system of the organized action. More particularly, this research finds a ground of demonstration in what agreed to call the (PPP), in order to fill out abyss of linguistic and extralinguistic considerations by the coherence operator of theoretical and empirical sense of  the hypothetical model."
"Multinationals that are moving abroad for its subsidiary operation may use any one of the typology such as Global, Multi-domestic,Transnational, and International strategy in order to manage and maintain their business abroad. International staffing is a critical elementof the implementation of the four strategies for doing business globally. In staffing the international operation, the organization mayfollow one of the three staffing approaches or a combination of three approaches (PCN, HCN, TCN) depending on their domesticcircumstances and the life cycle of the MNC. In all the three staffing approaches (Ethnocentric, Polycentric, Geocentric) PCNs, HCNs andTCNs are used. But they will differ in relative proportions. There is little evidence in support of the utilization of HCNs and TCNs. Most ofthe research focused on expatriates (PCNs) than HCNs and TCNs. Therefore we want to explore on what situations multinationals useHCNs and TCNs. Further the study investigates the alignment between international business strategy and executive staffing. Theoreticalfoundations are drawn basically from existing literature.Primary data were collected from top executives of 22 multinationals. In depth interviews were conducted and open ended questionswere used to examine the alignment between international business strategy and executive staffing for subsidiary operation, expatriateroles during organization’s different life cycle. The multinationals participated in our sample are from Singapore, Dubai, India, France,Netherlands, and Belgium. The data analysis is based on interpretative philosophy. The analysis of the proposed research expectationrevealed that the pattern of result is consistent when higher the pressure for standardization, utilization of ethnocentric staffing (PCNs) ismore. Whereas the pressure for standardization is low, then multinationals used other staffing approaches - polycentric staffing (HCNs).The pattern is partially consistent with strategy staffing alignment when the higher the local responsiveness then the utilization ofpolycentric staffing should be more. But in the given situation, ethnocentric staffing is slightly more than polycentric even when the localresponsiveness is high. The findings extend the application of the underpinned theories and their beliefs in explaining the businessstrategy and executive staffing relationship and contribute to the body of knowledge. Implications of the results and direction for futureresearch are recommended."
"How to explain variations in the level of donation in comparable countries? In all industrialized countries, the economic crisis of the 1980s encouraged the search for alternatives to the welfare state by encouraging third sector organizations to play a greater role in a partnership for the definition and implementation of public policies.Among Third sector organizations, philanthropic foundations provide a legal framework that allows people who wish to carry out acts of generosity by allocating a part of their personal wealth in the form of gift, for the purpose of general interest. Giving can be considered as a concrete expression of the cooperation between citizens for the common good.All democratic countries try to promote giving. The conventional explanations of the variation in level of gift among developed countries do not consider the gift as a social fact. We argue that the level of giving can't be explained by the sum of individual gifts that each respond to personal motives but by the state of the society whose cohesion is determined to both by the presence of social capital and the representation of identities.Social capital can be understood as "" relationships, networks and norms that facilitate collective action."" Social capital refers to relations that individuals establish them in social networks and the norms of reciprocity that arise from these relationships.This thesis is focused, first, on the level of social capital in economically developed countries and secondly on the meaning of the gift as a mode of representation of identity. It helps define social capital theory by highlighting the close relationship that unites the concept of the gift and hence the construction of identities.This analysis of the relationship between gift, identity ans social capital has direct implications for research in the field of civil society. Civil society is presented from two different perspectives. The first perspective, in a North American tradition, determines the Third sector to the sole condition of ""non profit"" sector. The second perspective, in an European tradition, consider social economy with organizations or enterprises within both profit and non-profit sector. These organizations and entreprises mix in their actions a plurality of economic logics.Based on the analysis of Polanyi on the embedding of the economy and its various forms of integration, associated with the Maussian logic of the gift, we try to shed light on the socio-economic dimension, or political dimension, of social economy. Social economy can be seen as a ""gift economy"", understood as a plural economy.Finally, the New Economic Sociology offers both an analysis of the reticular economy based on the presence and density of interpersonal ties and a cultural analysis of the economy that connects markets to values. It is  possible to understand the social economy as a “social capital economy"". Social capital is understood as an organizational factor and a meaning."
"Network approach is more appropriate measure to describe the early internationalization of born global firms. The focus of our research is to investigate the origin, structure and role of social networks in the early internationalization of born global firms. We intend to investigate the structure of networks which is considered pre-requisite to study the other dimensions of network ties. Many researchers directly jump to study the role networks play without paying any attention from where these ties originate. Furthermore, much of the literature has connected the born global firms with high technology sector however, there are many examples of born global firms in traditional sectors. Similarly, very little is known about how various national context influence the internationalization process of firms. Therefore, we also intend to investigate network ties in the context of different industrial sectors and different level of country’s institutional development by comparing born global firms from France and Pakistan.Our results reveal that these small born global firms use their networks to overcome the constraints to rapid internationalization which has been supported by previous empirical findings. The results also reveal that origin of ties is in both business-social or non-business social settings. Both weak and strong ties are found to have positive impact on the early internationalization; however composition of ties is different in low-tech and high-tech firms. We also argue that instead of country‘s level of institutional development, composition of ties is moderated by the industrial sector in which firm is operating."
"This PhD thesis presents the local communities decisions toward the adoption of responsible innovations, the local communities being seen as public organizations. This analysis is carried out in a context of awareness of public organization' social responsibility. We perform a comparative study between the French and the Romanian communities and we propose a decision-making process of the public organizations. The decision is seen as a « meeting » between the mayors values, as the community decision-makers, the different stakeholders, playing an important role in the community's activity, and the several options available to the mayors. Moreover, the decision-making represents an evolution from the need to adopt the responsible innovations to the final decision of action or non-action ; this decision-making is under the stakeholders influence which involves the isomorphic pressures. The way that the mayors react to these influences lead us to identify 3 categories of adopters : the first adopters, the persuaded adopters and the hesitant adopters. These elements allowed us to confirm and complete the model from the theoretical part."
"Grid and Cloud computing make possible the sharing of computer system resources, such as storage or computation time, among a set of users, according to their requests, thereby creating an illusion of infinite resources. However, as soon as those resources are insufficient to meet users’s expectations, conflicts of interest arise. Therefore, unlimited access to limited resources may lead to inefficient usage which penalizes the whole set of users. In such environments, arbitration becomes necessary in order to settle those conflicts and ensure a fair allocation to all users. We present two classes of problems : multi-user resource allocation under uncertainty and multi-user periodic task scheduling. We tackle these problems from the point of view of fairness."
"As part of this thesis, we investigate the vehicle routing problem. We propose heuristics to solve this problem quickly and efficiently. In this thesis, we deal with three problems: the first is the Dial-a-ride problem. For this problem, we propose heuristics based on the technique of insertion and a constraint propagation technique. We propose also the procedure SPLIT and some operators of local research to solve this problem. The second is the multi-criteria DARP for which we propose an ELS framework. The third is a DARP problem with financial constraints (DARPF), which is an extension of DARP.  We solve this problem thanks to insertion heuristics using a constraint propagation technique. The objective function determines the characteristics of the tour. Experimental results show that our (meta-) heuristics give results more favorable to customers (better quality of service)"
"This dissertation contributes to the thriving literature in regulatory capture deepening our understanding of both cognitive and information capture along multiple lines. In chapter 1, I develop a theoretical model to analyze the difficult trade-off faced by politicians when delegating the regulation of the financial service industry. The model shows that the principal trades off the superior knowledge of the financial experts against their regulatory bias in favor of the regulated industry. Where the principal comes down on this trade-off depends on how complex the regulatory area is, and on how intense the industry’s preferences are. In chapter 2, I define precise indicators of regulatory capture and construct a data set of 42 agencies that allow me to evaluate the expectations of the model. My results show that the race to sophistication and the powers of financial lobbies seem to have influenced agency design: financial regulators better prevent information capture than cognitive capture. In chapter 3, I test two competing hypotheses to explain the disparities in agencies design: political explanations versus historical and culture explanations. I show that agencies’ level of independence and accountability is explained by the credible commitment hypothesis. This hypothesis however fails to explain agencies level of integrity, appearing commonly low."
"The digital revolution is taking place in a climate of distrust. Consumers and citizens often have a negative judment of digital practices (collection and data exploitation, etc.). Officials are calling for more transparency to surpass the current trust crisis. But will this principle of transparency be enough to restore trust in the digital environment? The question of transparency arises significantly today because of the risks of customer drift and manipulation. It also arises because of the changing communication modes which are now multiform, multidirectional and instantaneous. This research explains the role of perceived transparency of digital practices in the way we apprehend the customer relationship. A qualitative exploratory study on two samples validated the multi-dimensionality of the perceived transparency construct (objectivity, clarity, openness) using the perceptions of 16 consumers and 12 managers. An online quantitative study (ad hoc panel of 445 respondents) conducted on the perceptions of Amazon customers, an e-commerce pure player, leader in the field and pioneer in the massive exploitation of data (recommendation engines , customization, etc.), has helped to 1) develop a measurement scale of perceived transparency, 2) understand how the customers’ digital transformation had a role in the perception of transparency and 3) determine the influence of perceived transparency’s dimensions on trust building and commitment. A qualitative post-survey study was finally conducted to discuss with managers the implications of this doctoral research."
"The following three essays focus on forest use in Gabon. The heterogeneity of countries and contexts does not allow for a single model of forest land allocation or forest land management. As a result, the external validity of country-specific research findings is fragile. However, the difficulty of obtaining general results should not hinder monographic research, as forest policies must be evaluated in their national context. That’s why this research work focuses on one country : Gabon. It proposes, through three essays, a reflection on the diﬃcult reconciliation of economic development issues and the allocation of forest resources. The thesis is structured as follows : a first chapter analyzes the policy of log export ban and its results, the second chapter studies the link between logging companies the practices and their impacts on the local population, finally the last chapter examines the situation of the workers in the natural rubber production sector and the one of the out growers."
"The sub-region Central Africa, in the perspective of continuing the construction of its economic and common Monetary Area (CEMAC) strengthened has died to set up a stock exchange of Central Africa (BVMAC) for the development of its system common financial system with subregional competence.Meanwhile, one of the member countries, in this case Cameroon has a stock exchange, the Douala Stock Exchange (DSX), with the same objectives but national competence. There are therefore problems of competition, competiveness and efficiency. In short, a problem of performance of the two stock exchanges weakening the financing of its economy by the financial market to the detriment of the major potential beneficiaries that are the companies.How to structure and reorganize the financial markets of Central Africa to improve their performance in financing its economy? This question then raises the issue of the reconstruction of CEMAC’s financial markets. To answer this main question, it is necessary to take into account two constituent determinants of CEMAC:	The Economic Union of Central Africa (UEAC)And	The Central Africa Monatry Union (UMAC)In order to support four theories namely:	Optimal Monetary Zone theory	Centrality theory	Mutualization theory	Structural change (organization)But also empirically, to know how is organized according to the current models, that is to say the international standards of different financial markets around the world.To demonstrate the constraint of consolidating these two financial markets in the same community space on the basic of the CODERE model is strong according to Kurt Lewin (940) model and analyze their current performance. The hain borrowed from the financial integration of these financial market leads to a bipolar or multipolar specialization of this privileged development actor that is the financial market."
"The human lifespan has been increasing in the world for several centuries. This increase was greater than predicted by specialists who set limits to human age. Despite the significant uncertainties about the future of longevity, the biology of aging and its applications seem about to make old age mortality rates drop, at it happened to infant mortality 150 years ago.The pharmaceutical industry is becoming aware of the potential of biomedical innovations stemming from the biology of aging. It invests in biotechs and develops internal teams. This could accelerate life extension.In parallel, actuarial tables tend to artificially predict longevity decelerations, as for the Lee Carter model, and calculated longevity risks are far from representing major advances from biology of aging.Here, models that do not produce deceleration are developed. It appears that an increase of around one quarter per year was, until now, a better predictor than the trends of each country. Other models predict diverse accelerations, impacts on pensions are analyzed.Current pharmaceutical efforts to apply the results of biomedical research may be feared because of their impact on pensions. Here we study in what measure a longevity megafund can both help finance funded pension schemes and a large number of pharmaceutical developments: the pooling of clinical trial risks can financially capture longevity-related biomedical successes"
"20% of an age group comes out of the educational system without qualification. Should this non-quality of the educational process be questioned? Quality management is now a widely accepted an organizational framework of managerial culture. The emergence of a new social contract, characterized by the New Work Order seems concomitant of New Public Management which promotes organizational concepts taken from the business culture and applied to institutions. These transfers can nonetheless cause problems. For example, translating principles in a different context, and also when stakeholders are not receptive or even refusing both the paradigms and their implementation. We analyze the applicability conditions of the ISO 9000 norm to educative institutions, focusing on vocational education which contains special features that allow us to understand the aim of the educational system as the preparation to a first professional position. Based on a field-work of semi-structured interviews, we propose a modelization of the process as well as recommendations about applicability conditions of a quality management course of actions in an educative institution. We also try to go beyond the impact analysis of organizational issues when applying ISO 9000 in an educative context. We unveil a complex system of sometimes contradictory customer voices, or stakeholders taking up different roles and functions in the process. We have tried to set up an analytic tool to monitor the relation between an individual and an organization, or a student and an institution. To do so, we adapted Rousseau’s Psychological Contract Index both to the public target population and to the context of the relation. A set of collected data quantitative study allowed us to isolate a series of factors influencing implicit and explicit dynamics at work in education and professional training. A procedure is not necessarily a continuation of answers but it can be a means of asking questions."
"For the two last decades, an abundant literature has been entirely devoted to the treatment of the place of the HRM in the implication of human resources for the achievement of strategic objectives and the improvement of the firms' performance. This literature concerns the Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM). If the majority of the research carried out in the study of the bonds between the HRM and firms' effectiveness led to significant results, these studies remained silent on the question of resistance of this effect in a long time. Currently, firms are concerned about the way to maintain their performance as long as possible, taking into account the running risks. The sustainability of the performance thus becomes the managers' major concern. By raising this issue, our research aims to increase former studies and to provide a complementary light to the strategic human resources management. ""Configurational"" approach of human resources should be the conceptual foundation to find an answer to this issue. This approach stipulates that a strategy of human resources made up of internal and external coherent HRM practices with the strategy business, is likely to ensure a long term performance. Our method is based upon longitudinal data coming from REPONSE survey led by DARES and BVA Institute for the periods of 1997-1998 and 2004-2005. This survey was carried out into a representative sample of 2978 French Business Units of more than 20 employees in 1998, and 2930 Business Units of the same size in 2005. The principle static and dynamic results of this research show that simultaneous associations between HRM systems and the four dimensions of the performance (profitability, innovation, absenteeism and social climate) stand up to the introducion of temporal shift. This conclusion supports the relevance of human resource strategy's coherence like an asset in the maximization of sustainable performance."
"The development of this work is currently carried out in a project mode, since working in the network requires deep modifications in a way of conceiving the workspaces as well as the offices. The enterprises that conceive these spaces often associate both the designers and the architects.The purpose of this present thesis is to answer the flowing question: how are the recent knowledges generated in the conception activities which appear in the field of work space planning?The first chapter focuses on the works related to the conception activities (works of Lebahar, Hatchuel and Visser...etc...). The second deals with the different theories relating to the generation of knowledge (works of Nonaka, Tsoukas and Engeström... etc...).To answer our research question, we have installed a device which requires a long_term intervention inside the enterprises meant for study (ethnomethodological approach). There are two Parisian enterprises that specialize in work space planning: (GENIE DES LIEUX and workspace CBRE).During the work, we have shown some difficulty intercomprehension that emerged in the conception activities. We have concluded, as a result, that these obstacles were due to relational tacit knowledges (RTK) according to Harry Collins theory. However these difficulties can be made explicit by the conception of intermediate objects.We have also noticed that ho when conceiving the artifacts into two and three dimensions, this allows the generation of new and useful knowledges in a project of work space planning."
"The valorisation of university research, through the creation of high technology enterprise, is a new mission assigned to universities since the enactment of the 1999 law, known as Allègre law. Technology incubators, which are new hybrid structures, have appeared at the border of three radically different spheres: universities, businesses and governments. Their mission is to support and facilitate the marketing of technological innovations. However, because of the uncertain and hypothetical nature of innovations, they disrupt habits and routines of the industry. Incubation of these technology companies can not then be summarized to access to material resources but as has to be also considered as a negotiating process which gives legitimacy to inventions in order to be accepted by the market. We show that this process requires also access to social resources. Access of these new entrepreneurs to these resources is done mainly through social networks of the managers of the incubator, through mediation and intermediation. This mediation allows a transfer of trust, credibility and legitimacy. Accordingly, it generates a new network for the entrepreneur and facilitates its integration into the community of entrepreneurs."
"Timber production is related to economic, climate and energy issues. In France,according to data from the National Institute of Geoinformation and Forestry, thebiological growth rate of the forest is greater than the timber harvest rate. Thus, theFrench government has set a target of harvesting an additional quantity of 21 millioncubic meter of timber by 2020 (""Grenelle de l'environnement, 2007""). However, theFrench forest is majority owned by private forest owners who have preferences forboth income from timber trade and from non-timber amenities. The policies toincrease timber production must include these aspects. The objective of this thesisis to understand the determinants of joint production of timber and non-timberamenities in France.Therefore, we first analyze private forest owners' timber supply, taking into accountindividual and regional determinants. Afterwards, we investigate whether thedrivers of forest owners behavior differ within and between these different levels.We show that similar timber supply behavior can be observed when regional characteristicsor those of peers are similar. Then, we highlight a mimicry behavior injoint production decisions of timber and amenities made by private forest owners.Finally, we analyze inter-temporal trade-offs made by the owners from non-timberamenities and income from the sale of wood. We explicitly take into account theprice expectations and growth. Our estimations show that the willingness to pay fornon-timber amenities is e23 for our case study. This value is the difference betweenthe value they could have earned if they tried to maximize timber revenue and therevenue of their actual logging.Mainly beacause of a lack of involvement of private owners, either through a lackof knowledge or interest in their forest, or because other aspects are privileged (nontimberamenities, e.g.), a part of forest ressource is not subject to a commercial offer.Providing ways to mobilize this ressource is one of the challenges of this work. Weshow that the mimetic effects and the contextual effects can be used to encourageforest owners to produce more timber. An effective policy could be a combinationof these two effects. We also show that an increase in the price of timber or theadoption of a tax may be an incentive for timber harvesting."
"This thesis aims to explain the convex relationship between mutual funds flows and their performance, related to the strategies of funds promoters. Our theory is the following: because the mutual fund promoter's profit is dependent on the amount of assets under management, they have a strong incitation to induce this  convexity. Using Hotelling models and switching cost theory, we have identified two strategies available to promoters: the ""supply policy"", which consists in building and maintaining a strong customer relationship with investors and ""informational policy"", which aims to feed investors' beliefs according to which the promoters give more performing funds than competitors. Two empirical studies, using EUROPERFORMANCE database include 8161 French UCITS from 1998 to 2002, are proposed. We conduct multilevel models that explicitly take account of the common variance shared by UCITS that are provided through the same promoter. The main results point out that, after taking into account the non-independence of observations, the convexity of the flow-performance relationship is more or less pronounced depending on the promoters' efficiency to use their strategies. We alsoshow that strategies adopted by promoters vary according to financial market conjuncture: the growth period is marked by a ""prime to uncertainty"" where the promoters reputation, which enables them to enjoy ""spillover effect"" is the most effective strategy to improve market share. In period of crisis, it is the ability of promoters to internalize flows and organize their internal market with an efficient ""supply policy"" that explains their ability to maximize market share. Finally, the reputation of the promoters has a direct positive effect on flows and increases their sensitivity to the performance of UCITS. The search for ""spillover effect"", which is in conflict of interests with investors, is the dominant strategy adopted by the promoters of French UCITS."
"This research emerges from a problem observed in practice: the unfavourable echo of management tools prescriptions in SME’s context. First the review of literature reveals the management tools as a strategic stakes, which however aims SME specificities. At the same time, it leads to SME transformation logic, which prevents the business manager and his organization to evolve. The first exploration of the research question, by observation and survey, show that SME’s management tools is strongly correlated with the leadership’s cognition. Also, it cannot be apprehended independently of the organisational action. In this way, it puts the stakes of sharing common vision of management tools’ project and organizational mechanisms of learning. The thesis focuses on the problem of management tools adoption in SME by mobilizing the cognitive theories and the actors’ action theories. More particularly, the research is based on interactionnist, processual and dynamics approach of management tools. It is also focused on two dimensions: a managerial dimension which treats the leadership/management tools interface, and an organizational dimension which treats the organization/management tool interface. Moreover, a case study makes allows illustration of the theories put forward to propose a model of the management tools adoption in SME. This model suggests to SMEs’ business managers, as to management tools prescribers, the consideration of the intensity of certain interactions (between SME, its leader, the management tools and the prescriber) for the adoption. In that way, this research proposes orientations for the management of SME management tools project."
"While working with a focus group of SMEs managers, we detected a large uncertainty about future continuity of business transactions. Strategy and value creation of products and services are significantly important if we considered that this kind of organization has a lot of restrictions and depends mainly on their commercial activities to survive, be profitable and grow. But, as we established on the first part of this thesis, although the traditional management approachesconverge they seem to be insufficient because they are based on the principles of order and control by considering only a part of the dynamism of these companies, while in practice everything seems to be dynamic, disordered and complex. So we ask the question: How can we help SMEs to create strategies in complex situations? The theoretical proposition developed in the second part studies the dynamical phenomena by classifying the company as a complex system submitted to interruptions and emergencies and linked to dynamics attractors and restrictors. Finally, based on a constructivist epistemology, we have implemented theoreticalpropositions developed at field-research through an intervention methodology for helping SMEs to design a value creation strategy, of products and services, in a dynamic approach."
"This thesis focuses on presenteeism at work, a phenomenon that refers to the behavior of employees who go to work although they are sick. Our goal is to try to answer the following question: what is the decision process that leads an individual who is temporarily affected by sickness to decide to report sick and/or to attend despite the illness? Specifically, our goal is to study the determinants that lead a sick employee to choose between three options: a total absence (the employee is absent for the whole duration of the spell of illness), total attendance (he works for the whole duration), partial attendance, that is to say a combination of absence and attendance in the same spell of illness. To our knowledge, this third possibility has never been considered in the literature, which only distinguishes absence and attendance. To analyze the choice between these three possibilities, we have designed and conducted a survey to identify, for each employee in the survey, his last spell of illness, and for it, the decision between total absence, total attendance and partial attendance. As we will show, taking into account combinations of absence and attendance in the same spell of illness significantly modifies the measure of presenteeism, in comparison to the way it is generally measured in the empirical literature. Our results also highlight the predominant role of illness characteristics in the behavior of the employee, especially the role of the duration of the spell of an illness. Our results also show the effect on the decision of, one the one hand, risks that the employee takes for his future health if he decides to attend, totally or partially and, on the other hand, risks he takes for his job and for his future wage if he decides to report sick leave during the full spell of illness or during just a part of it"

"The 2008 financial crisis was largely caused by excessive risk-taking of banks fromthe U.S. and also from all over the world, which have been in big trouble since then. One ofthe major questions raised by scientists and regulators is the role of executive remunerationmethods in encouraging bank risk-taking. We conduct this research to investigate whether thebanks' executive compensation payment mechanisms induced risk-taking and contributed tothe financial crisis. We analyze separately the impact of each component of CEOcompensation, which include CEO salary, CEO bonus, CEO other annual compensation,percentage of CEO salary, percentage of CEO bonus, percentage of other annualcompensation and equity-based compensation, on risk-taking in the banking sector. We alsotry to identify more specifically the possible responsibility of each remuneration method intriggering the financial crisis and the manifestations of bank risk in the first two years ofcrisis. Different measures of bank risk include total risk, systematic risk, idiosyncratic risk,loan loss provision to total loan ratio, non-performing loan to total loan ratio, distance-todefaultmeasured by Z-score, sharp drop in bank stock price, the change in bank ratings andthe change in CDS during the crisis period. Using a sample of 63 large banks in Europe,Canada and United States from 2004 to 2008 we find that both CEO salary and CEO bonusdecrease with most types of bank risk, CEO other annual compensation increases with bankrisk. These components of CEO compensation are illustrated to have no relationship to thechange of bank risk during the crisis. Regarding the CEO equity-based compensation, we findthat usage of restricted stock to compensate CEO during the pre-crisis period has no effect onany abnormal changes in bank risks during the crisis period, whereas usage of stock option tocompensate CEO in the same period augments the manifestations of bank risk in the crisis."
"We’re interested in the relationship between work-life balance, self-efficacy, job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to leave. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 232 managers from various small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in Lorraine. Results of the SEM analysis showed that work-family conflict was negatively related to job satisfaction. Moreover, perceived self-efficacy was found to moderate this relationship such that the relationship between work-family conflict and job satisfaction were not statistically and negatively significant for managers reporting high levels of self-efficacy. An investigation of components of self-efficacy delivers interesting information. Work self-efficacy (WSE) is one of these factors. Self-efficacy received feedback (SERF) is suggested in this paper as the other factor of SE. We define SERF as the perception of an individual on the way its hierarchy judges its work. The results of this research give evidence that WSE acts on stress work-family conflict so that it increases job satisfaction. Conversely, SERF increases the negative effects of the stress work-family conflict on the job satisfaction. This thesis offers explanations of the opposite effects and proposes recommendations for human resources management"
"We investigate how social and environmental responsibilities can be considered in the strategic decision-making processes of corporations. This doctoral research is based on three empirical papers, providing evidence for individual and organizational drivers of corporate social performance. We consider corporate social performance as a triple performance of corporations: economic, social and environmental. Corporate social performance measures the level of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which corresponds to the contribution of corporations to a sustainable development. For the first paper, we question in France180 financial and 144 non-financial managers, and 83 students in finance and 117 students in other majors than finance. Our investigations provide an overview of how financial managers perceive the importance of sustainability for corporate strategy. The second paper is based on the study of 286 companies of the STOXX Europe 600 Index of years 2007 to 2010. The results of this cross-cultural study are expected to contribute to a better understanding of when there is a need for the presence of a board CSR committee. In the third paper we use firm-level data of year 2012 from the Bloomberg World Index of 178 companies having created a board CSR committee. The results of this last study offer ways to ensure a suitable composition of this committee."
"This thesis is dedicated to study a cultural contingency of the entrepreneurial intention-action. It uses empirical research which permits, through a triangulation method, to explore the role of national culture in these notions. A theoretical analysis of main concepts on entrepreneurship and national culture enables to suggest an adapted conceptual framework for studying cultural contingency on entrepreneurial intention. In fact, this framework proposes an approach that permits to integrate different analysis levels of national culture and their effects on the entrepreneurial intention formation. The thesis presents its problematic and methodological project, through interviews and questionnaires applied in 35 case studies of small business creators, coming from ""Lorraine"" region (France) and ""Grand Tunis"" region (Tunisia). The data treatment (quantitative and qualitative analysis) brings to adopt the cultural contingency of perceived desirability and feasibility to start a business. The research suggests that intention of business creation can't be considered as universal. On the other hand it can be surrounded according to specific cultural characteristics, particularly, cultural values and beliefs, relational context, motivations, entrepreneurs' roles models, etc. It defends also the imbrication's entrepreneurial and national cultures."
"Nous étudions le processus de création de droit d'asile et son impact sur les réfugiés. Le chapitre préliminaire présente l'histoire des flux de réfugiés et du droit d'asile, la recherche sur les raisons de migration ainsi que les enjeux du sujet. Le deuxième chapitre a pour objet l'influence du droit d'asile sur les flux d'immigration de réfugiés. Nous analysons l'impact des restrictions des différents types de mesure du droit d'asile sur les décisions des réfugiés en terme d'émigration et de demande d'asile. A travers les passeurs, un impact indirect influence la taille des flux et le nombre de demandes. Le troisième chapitre décrit le choix du niveau de droit d'asile des différents niveaux de gouvernement en fonction de l'impact du droit sur les flux de réfugiés. Le quatrième chapitre porte sur la question de savoir le meilleur choix institutionnel de production du droit d'asile en Union Européenne. Tenant compte des objectifs en terme d'immigration clandestine, il compare les niveaux de droit d'asile qui seraient adoptés par les gouvernements nationaux, par le Conseil de l'Union Européenne, par le Parlement Européen, et en co-décision entre ces deux dernières institutions. Le cinquième chapitre a pour objet la structure des subventions accordées aux Etats membres par le Fonds Européen pour les Réfugiés (FER). En effet, le FER accorde une partie limitée en subventions fixes et une partie plus importante en financement complémentaire à des projets. Nous étudions l'impact des différentes subventions et de leur combinaison sur les dépenses en aide aux réfugiés en présence de coûts de transaction."

"Many studies, essentially Western, have tested hypotheses for split/reverse splits announcements over the past few decades. Two major hypotheses emerge from these studies. The ""signaling hypothesis"" assumes that the split announcement (ad) allows listed firms managers to convey to the market private information concerning future cash flows. The ""price adjustment"" hypothesis aims a more operational objective. According to this hypothesis, the operation is a means for adjusting the stock price in a way to impact liquidity and risk or to satisfy the various investor classes. More recent works observe, in addition to the price impact and volatility or liquidity effects, a modification in the ownership structure of the firms, resulting from these operations. Realized empirical studies and mobilized event study techniques in our works show that these two classical hypotheses are difficult to apply to the French market. Observations on this market lead to expand the research problem to the possible link between securities price level and shareholding composition. An original hypothesis is then proposed, modeled and tested. This hypothesis of ""shareholding adjustment by the stock price"" explains why reactions are such different on this market, as well as the managers' incentives. The choice of the ""optimal"" share price can be seen in this context as a trade-off between the increased performance from institutional investor monitoring and the benefits in terms of required rate of return to have a broad individual shareholder base."
"The study of the relationship between the enterprise project and the managerial project is defined according to several theories that are likely to enlighten our research, intermingling constructivism and Giddens's theory. In the light of the already existing intermediary media, the analysis on both social and medico-social fields is usually led, taking into account environmental constraints, ant particularly in the choice of strategic orientations, via innovation, complexity and how to handle uncertainty. Our research aims at measuring the level of potentiality that exists between the projects. This level is grounded in two visions? the first one?s goal is to identify the elements of humane structuralization along with the elements of relationship building; the second vision tries to determine the level of influence of Giddens?s theory on an attempt to suggest a model of organization and piloting. Being concerned about rationalizing our research, it will focus on this theory. The question is to know whether enterprises develop their strategy in a disjunctive vision of the projects, or in the definition and a dialogic implementation of managerial principles deeply influenced by innovation. Given the environment of proximity in a governing where the manager holds the strategic vision, of the use of managerial behaviors, it appears that enterprises, defined as communities, are capable of establishing a relationship that can do without the constraints imposed by the context and also fight status quo. So as to measure the level of potentiality of the relationship, our choice was to lead our research on five clinical cases. The meaning of this contribution is to highlight a managerial style and also a new perspective for structuring the organization. Our interviews and a quantitative and qualitative analyses made us notice that projections of linking the projects represent an applicable and even inescapable element for the survival of organizations. If they are at liberty to use them, it remains nevertheless that the enterprises that give it up, take the risk of exposing themselves to painful strategic choices due to the intensity of the environment."
"Entrepreneurship is basically built on dominants paradigms. These are esencially based on internal and external approaches and have influenced the teaching of entepreneurship. Today, in the entrereneurial research appears a new paradigm: the paradigm of the entrepreneurial process. Which is the place that take these in relation with the existent paradigms? Which is its impact in the teaching of entrepreneurship? To answer these questions we have tried to consider what could be a teaching of entrepreneurship under this paradigm. This is why we have been interested in the teaching of entrepreneurship in Morocco and we have developed an intervention research that permit us to work with didactics based on the entrepreneurial process. The thesis proposed is organized in three parts. The first one present the different entrepreneurial paradigms, introducing the paradigm of the entrepreneurial process beside the dominant paradigms. The second part is about the teaching of entrepreneuship and try to understand which is the position of entrepreneurship in the university and which are the positions of each different paradigm in this process, especially in Morocco. Facing the lack of teaching based on the entrepreneurial process in Morocco, we propose in a third and last part of this thesis to implement this kind of teaching from an intervention done in a university."
"The development of the economic analysis of liability was developed on the idea that this legal tool can ex ante provide incentives to prevent the risks of accident. In the context of large-scale technological risks prevention, this literature notably highlights the inefficiencies of the limited liability regime. This liability regime was implemented in order to build a protection, which encourages investors to provide massive capital inflows needed to start modern production capacities. But it can provide suboptimal incentives to prevent a risk of damage that is not fully internalized. In chapter 1, we draw a State of the Art of this literature and argue that a connection with the literature from environmental economics is necessary. Such a connection, that introduces the possibility of induced technological change into the analysis, was made in the context of effluents regulation. Our thesis will show that such a connection is also desirable for the economic analysis of large-scale technological risks prevention. Chapter 2 shows that allowing for technological change puts in perspective the inefficiencies of the limited liability regime. Indeed we highlight the fact that implementing such a regime can induce the firms to proceed to technological change, leading to a lower probability of accident and better risk internalization. Moreover, using a tax on the level of activity reinforce the efficiency of this liability regime. Chapters 3 and 4 extend the analysis to imperfectly known risks, which can be encountered when new technologies are introduced. We compare limited and unlimited liability regimes and show that the latter provide more incentives to search for more information about the imprecise risk, and it has the smoothest impact on technological choice. Finally, chapter 5 deals with innovation, when technological progress impacts both the cost of risk prevention and the probability of accident. We highlight that the nature of the innovation and the role of the Regulator are essential : in the presence of a 'conformist' Regulator strict liability is always preferable to negligence, but negligence may be preferable in the presence of a 'proactive' Regulator if the technological progress essentially impacts the cost of prevention."
"Forests in the European Union grow by 1.2 billion m³ per year. Half of this volume stays in the forest, in particular for sustainable forest management purposes. The other half flows into three industrial sectors: wooden material, paper products and wood energy. These industrial product flows are set into motion and paid for by diverse final consumers. Since 2000, consumption is undergoing important structural changes which cause large disturbances in material, paper and fuel flows. To predict the impact of these changes, economists model relationships between raw material supply, final products demand, prices, production and international trade. This thesis uses panel data econometrics to estimate parameters of empirical models. An introductory chapter sets the policy context of forest resources and forest products of interest at a macroeconomic level. Then I review major forest sector models and I focus on issues encountered while estimating parameters of demand models. A second chapter investigates the potential impact of a trade agreement between the EU and the US on the forest sector. We found that total welfare would increase in the region of the agreement, in addition the agreement benefits more to consumers than to producers. Results show that third party countries are impacted by the agreement too, which highlights the importance of using a global trade model in analysing the impacts of the agreement. In a third chapter I estimate revenue and price elasticities of demand for forest products on a panel of European countries. I deal with non stationarity issues and estimate demand elasticities within cointegrated panels. I demonstrate that revenue elasticities of demand are lower than previous estimates from the literature. Simulations using these robust elasticities in a forest sector model, show a lower demand over a 20 years time horizon. In a fourth chapter, I analyse structural changes in paper products consumption. For this purpose, I use a panel threshold model to estimate the relationship between information technology use and paper products consumption: newsprint, printing and writing paper. I show how paper demand elasticities depend on internet penetration in the population. Thresholds occur once a majority of the population has access to the internet. After the threshold, coefficients between paper consumption and its explanatory variables revenue and price become smaller in absolute terms or even change sign. Based on projections of the number of internet users per country, paper consumption projections could be updated with this type of thresholds models. From a policy perspective, lower demand for graphics paper would free resources and make them available for innovative forest products and services."
"The objective of this thesis is to study the definition of incentive payments for biodiversity conservation from an empirical and theoretical perspective. In this work, we also aim to account, in a relevant way, for spatial and dynamic ecological processes inherent to terrestrial biodiversity in the economic models that we develop. In the first chapter of this thesis, we empirically assess the cost effectiveness of incentive payments for biodiversity conservation implemented in French forests, namely Natura 2000 contracts, by undertaking an ex ante approach. Our results underline the inadequacy of the current definition of payments for Natura 2000 contracts and their poor calibration.  This calls for a rethinking of the definition of conservation incentives. In the second and third chapter of this thesis we leave the framework of Natura 2000 contracts. We study the definition of efficient and cost-effective incentive payments in a theoretical and conceptual way, while taking into account the main challenges posed by the definition of incentive payments for biodiversity conservation. Chapter 2 explores, through a principal-agent common-value model, the possibility of differentiating conservation payments for private landowners when both conservation costs and benefits are heterogeneous and unobservable to the conservation planner. This chapter focuses on the impact of asymmetric information - especially of adverse selection - on the definition of payments. In Chapter 3, we investigate the impact of climate change on the definition of cost-effective incentive payments. In this chapter, we develop an integrated, dynamic and spatially explicit ecological-economic model, and study the relative cost-effectiveness of various payment design options, involving different levels of targeting and differentiation of conservation payments. The work done throughout this thesis allows us to formulate recommendations regarding the targeting and design of incentive payments for biodiversity conservation."
"Hospital organizations are confronted with constant changes: technological change, societal change in expectations, the increasingly assertive role of the user, organizational changes advocated by guardians and a range of reforms that sometimes telescope. Health care institutions are at the heart of health system reforms and must continually adapt to changes. The implementation of new health policies raises the question of the adaptation of hospitals' organizations: adaptation linked to changes in the environment, increasing interactions between actors, taking into account healthcare networks, Clusters and crosscutting processes. The field of quality in hospital has also become a legal and regulatory requirement. Since the Hospital Act of 31 July 1991 and the Ordinances of April 1996 introducing the obligation to implement an external evaluation procedure, numerous regulatory changes concerning the certification procedures of healthcare establishments are grafted on the context Organizational structure already constrained. The integration of the quality approach into the hospital is strengthened. As early as 2020, the establishments constituting the Territorial Groupings will be subject to a common certification procedure. The articulation of the offer of care around shared medical projects amplifies the strategic and operational synergies of the healthcare institutions around a transversal and joint dimension of the quality and risk management approach. The regulatory changes that marked the hospital organizations have thus participated in the implementation of management tools with rationalizing aim and the taking into account of the quality as management tool has gradually developed. For if quality was first considered as a technical reduction of nonconformities, the integration of the human factor has largely contributed to thinking quality as a management tool. In fact, strategies for integrating the quality approach with management tools in hospital organizations can be beneficial. Indeed, the management tools are structural elements of the organization. They participate in its construction by influencing the social roles of actors. We believe that the use of quality management tools contributes to the deployment of the quality approach. Thus, we chose to determine the levers of appropriation of the quality approach based on the study of a quality management tool: the report card of the adverse events. Studying a quality management tool in an organizational context involves studying the tool itself, but also the contextual determinants specific to the organization in which it lives. The anchoring of the tool does not in any way hide its history, the environment in which it evolves, the intentions of the designers or the social and cultural context. Thus, a contextualized taking into account of the tool can be a means of measuring the level of integration of the quality process of a hospital organization. Indeed, the principles of integration of the quality approach are not borne by a typical method that would be reproduced identically in any hospital organization, they are integrative of the contingency factors specific to the organization and the level Of organizational maturity in the field of quality and risk management. The first part of this work delineates the concepts of quality in the hospital and management tools. The second part, based on an empirical approach to quality management tools, is based on the idea that it is possible to propose a model for measuring the integration factors of quality in hospitals for hospital managers"
"The first Chapter uses differential psychology and psychometrics to correlate tax evasion behaviour observed in the lab to individual personality traits, measured thanks to standardized psychometric questionnaires. These personality questionnaires are related to moral emotions, moral judgments and norm submission. The results are twofold. First, moral emotions better explain evasion behavior than any other personality questionnaire. However, secondly, the explanatory power of these personality traits remains very modest. This lack of a strong relationship suggests that individual characteristics are of little help to understand and predict tax evasion behavior. It highlights the importance of the institutional context in which compliance is elicited. The second and third Chapters try to better account for this institutional context, using the social psychology of commitment. The second Chapter shows that a modification of the taxpayer’s environment, thanks to the exposition to an oath to tell the truth, increases the level of honesty of subsequent tax reports. Building on these results, the third Chapter investigates the hypothesis that direct democracy, as present in some cantons in Switzerland, could be the source of higher tax compliance. According to the existing literature, its cause could be either social coordination between agents or a commitment effect due to the vote itself. The results show that social coordination between taxpayers does not explain this phenomenon, which rather reflects a commitment effect of participation in the electoral process."
"The Own Risk Solvency and Assessment (ORSA) is a set of processes defined by the European prudential directive Solvency II, that serve for decision-making and strategic analysis. In the context of ORSA, insurance companies are required to assess their solvency needs in a continuous and prospective way. For this purpose, they notably need to forecast their balance sheet -asset and liabilities- over a defined horizon. In this work, we specifically focus on the asset forecasting part. This thesis is about the Yield Curve, Forecasting, and Forecasting the Yield Curve. We present a few novel techniques for the construction, the extrapolation of static curves (that is, curves which are constructed at a fixed date), and for forecasting the spot interest rates over time. Throughout the text, when we say ""Yield Curve"", we actually mean ""Discount curve"". That is: we ignore the counterparty credit risk, and consider that the curves are risk-free. Though, the same techniques could be applied to construct/forecast the actual risk-free curves and credit spread curves, and combine both to obtain pseudo- discount curves incorporating the counterparty credit risk"
"This thesis focuses on the measurement of dissimilarity in the distribution of relevant economic attributes and inequality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity has gained popularity for defining the relevant equalitarian objective for the distribution of a broad range of social and economic outcomes among social groups. I show that equality of opportunity concerns in policy evaluation always rely on dissimilarity comparisons between conditional distributions, and I provide empirically testable criteria to implement these comparisons. In the first chapter, I characterize axiomatically the dissimilarity partial order for discrete conditional distributions of groups across outcome classes. I prove that, when classes are permutable, dissimilarity is rationalized by matrix majorization and implemented by checking zonotopes inclusion, while when classes are ordered the dissimilarity criterion resorts on a finite number of Lorenz majorization comparisons among groups' proportions, performed at different cumulation stages of the overall population. In the second chapter, I discuss the relevance of the dissimilarity partial order for the study of segregation at individual level. I fully characterize a well defined family of segregation indicators and I study one of them, the Gini exposure index, by using Italian data. The final chapter presents the equalization of opportunity criterion for outcome achievements. The guiding principle is that equality of opportunities is reached if there is no consensus, for a given class of preferences, in determining the disadvantaged group out of pairwise comparisons. I use the changes in (lack of) consensus on the existence and on the extent of the disadvantage to characterize the equalization of opportunity criterion. Meaningful restrictions and possible aggregation procedure are also discussed. I motivate that this criterion is identified within the rank dependent utility model, and I provide innovative inference results for inverse stochastic dominance to test it. Two applications on French data illustrate the equalizing impact of educational policies taking place early in students life."
"This paper uses a search model with the product differentiation in a two-sided market. The two-sided market matches sellers with buyers. On the buyers' side it supplies some match information between the goods and the buyers. On the firms' side, it sells some empty slots to the firms. Any firm either takes a place in any platform or stays outside. Buyers search for a good either inside or outside the platform. Each search of the an outside firm is costly and gives the match information between the searcher (buyer) and the seller. We study two cases. In the first case, all buyers obtain the match information in the platform for free. The equilibrium price and profit of an inside firm drops in the number of inside firms. The monopoly platform, by adjusting the entrance fee, admit fewer firms under a higher search cost. If the market has two platforms, they generally admit more firms than the case with one platform. In the second case, the platform is able to impose a fee for all consumers who enter the platform. Our last result has indicated that the platform will register all buyers and firms."
"In this thesis, we examine one key topic related to copula theory contributions to the financial portfolio management theory and to the study of structured credit products.The first part of this thesis deals with financial portfolio management. We first discuss the relationship between portfolio diversification and the choice of the copula that better describes the dependence structure. The goal is to identify one feature of portfolios making straightforward the process of the appropriate copula selection. In the second chapter, we propose to study the impact of copula model misspecification, on conventional risk measures estimates as for the example of Value-at-Risk and Expected-Shortfall. The idea is to check the validity of developing these estimates under the true copula model. In a third chapter, we apply such approach to optimal portfolio allocation problem. The main objective is to identify investor's sensitivity, depending on their risk (or loss) aversion, to one of the component of the copula model. Thus, we propose one possible linkage between the behavioral finance theory and the copula functions framework.The second part of the thesis focuses on structured credit products. In a first chapter, we study the contribution of an actuarial model, using copulas functions in modeling the dependence structure between times of defaults, in the process of risk measures estimates. Finally, in a last chapter we re-examine the “Diversity Score” concept, developed by the Moody's rating agency to assign the quality of structured credit portfolio in terms of diversification. We discuss the analogy of this measure with that of the copula approach, and demonstrate its adequacy with some copula functions families."
"This work is a contribution to the economy of the family to analyze the importance of the family interactions on the behavior of the economic agents. So we propose during this document an evaluation of the importance of these interactions in the decision-making of the households. The basic model which will be used in the various results is the one of Browing and Chiappori ( 1998 ) and generalized by Chiappori and Ekeland (2006 ). This work contains possibly three chapters the objective of which is unique; it is a question of analyzing the effect of the family interactions on the decision-making of the households:    The first part of the thesis  has for objective to model the effect of parental's risk aversion on their marital choice. The theoretical foundations of this work are in a generalization of the article of Arrondel and Calvo(2011).     In the second part of the thesis, we estimate the effect of the marital status, marriage vs cohabitation, on children's well-being  by using  the data of the Family Expenditure Survey, FES, for period 1995-2006.    In the third part of the thesis, we illustrate the relation “matrimoine consumption” by a more structural empirical application using the same British data but for longer period ( 1988-2007 ). More particularly, we are interested to estimate individual children’s cost.  The proposed model is inspired by recent collective model of the behavior of the household  developed by Browning, Chiappori et Lewbel (2008) and Lewbel et Pendakur (2008)."
"This thesis study the dualism existing on the French labor market. Especially, I study job and worker flows and the role played by temporary contracts in those flows. The employment protection legislation is stringent in France then firms are subject to important rules when they adjust their workforce. However, it seems that the employment legislation governing the use of temporary contracts is not so binding in practice since this type of contract is widely used and that their duration is more and more shorter. In order to have a better knowledge of the French labor market and of the dualism, this thesis is divided in three chapters. The first one quantifies job and worker flows over the 1998-2012 period and explores the possible impact of the 2008 crisis on those flows taking into account industry characteristics. In addition, I study the evolution of contracts' duration and I propose an econometric analysis that highlight the determinants of temporary hirings.The second chapter quantifies transitions existing on the French labor market and their impact on unemployment volatility. I use a three-state (employed, unemployed, inactive) and a four-state model (permanently employed, temporary employed, unemployed, inactive). This latest model has never been studied for the French case yet.Finally, the last chapter analyzes the consequences of the implementation of a tax on short-term contracts that is supposed to encorage firms to hire with permanent contracts and increase the duration of contracts. This kind of reform has been in several european countries. In France, this tax was implemented by the Interprofessional agreement in july 2013. A search and matching model is estimated on French data from UNEDIC using the model proposed by Caguc, Charlot and Malherbet (2016)."
"In many situations, decision makers do not observe all relevant information which undermines their ability to choose the best action or policy. Moreover, it can be difficult or costly to directly acquire the missing information. In such cases, the decision maker may acquire information from privately informed parties with potentially different objectives. The issue is that they may try to influence the outcome in their favor either by withholding or selectively reporting information. For instance, employers rely on information presented by job applicants, financial authorities use firms' reports to evaluate them and elected representatives seek expert advice before selecting policies. In these examples, at least some information is certifiable or verifiable. In other words, the informed party can prove certain statements by presenting hard evidence or the decision maker can verify the accuracy of received claims and documents. Since verification can be costly or time consuming, the decision maker might be able to only partially check the claim. These constraints determine the amount of information that can be verified before the decision is made. The first two chapters focus on models that best describe settings where the decision maker has to evaluate a claim or respond to a request made by an individual or institution. In the third chapter, I consider a slightly different framework where the decision maker seeks advice by consulting informed agents.In the first chapter, I study the basic framework where the informed agent's preferences over the decision maker's actions are independent of the state. In unilateral communication, only the agent sends a message to the decision maker. In bilateral communication, both exchange messages sequentially. I study and compare these two types of mechanisms under the constraint that the agent can present the same amount of certifiable information in both cases. In the canonical bilateral communication mechanism, after receiving a claim from the agent, the decision maker asks him to certify a certain event and bases her decision on his ability to do so. The main result of this chapter essentially states that if information certification is limited and the limitation prevents the decision maker from achieving her first-best in unilateral communication then she strictly benefits from bilateral communication.In the second chapter, which results from a joint work with Frédéric Koessler (CNRS, Paris School of Economics), we study implementation in the presence of ambiguity aversion. We show that if an allocation rule can be implemented with unlimited information certification, then it can also be implemented with limited information certification if the designer can use ambiguous communication mechanisms, and if agents are averse to ambiguity in the sense of maxmin expected utility. The reverse implication is true if there is a single agent and a worst outcome.In the third chapter, I study a setting with two types of informed agents. One type prefers higher actions while the other prefers lower actions. The decision maker ignores the informed agent's preferences. In this case, it might not be sufficient to consult one agent. I study sequential consultation of more than one informed agent and examine its impact on information revelation. It is shown that in equilibrium the decision maker may consult more than one agent and that she continues to seek advice as long as her uncertainty is high enough. Learning on the equilibrium path happens through both revelation and withholding of information. It is possible for agents of the minority - in terms of preferences - to influence the decision maker by withholding information so that she chooses their favorite outcome when she should not. Moreover, sequential consultation can be used as a threat to extract more precise information while consulting only one agent."
"This thesis contains three stand-alone essays on the operating segment disclosures that European multi-segment companies make under IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Each essay aims to improve our collective understanding about managers’ disclosure strategy by examining various characteristics of operating segment disclosure. Chapter I, entitled “The Interplay between Segment Disclosure Quantity and Quality,” investigates managers’ choices with respect to both disclosure quantity and disclosure quality, and the usefulness of these two characteristics for financial analysts. Focusing on segment disclosures under the management approach, I measure quantity as the number of segment-level line items and quality as the cross-segment variation in profitability, and argue that greater managerial discretion can be exercised over quality than over quantity. I hypothesize and find that managers solve proprietary concerns either by deviating from the suggested line-item disclosure in the standard, or if following standard guidance, by decreasing segment reporting quality. Moreover, financial analysts do not always understand the quality of segment disclosures, which suggests that a business-model type of standard creates difficulties even for sophisticated users. My results inform standard setters as they start working on a disclosure framework and as they seem to consider the business model approach to financial reporting. Chapter II is entitled “Inconsistent Segment Disclosure across Corporate Documents.” Market regulators in the U.S. and Europe investigate cases of inconsistent disclosures when a company provides different information on the same topic in different documents. Focusing on operating segments, this essay uses hand-collected data from four different corporate documents of multi-segment firms to analyze the impact of inconsistent disclosure on financial analysts’ earnings forecast accuracy. Inconsistencies that arise from further disaggregation of operating segments in some documents seem to bring in new information and increase analyst accuracy. However, when analysts must work with different, difficult-to-reconcile segmentations, their information processing capacity and forecasts are less accurate. These findings contribute to our understanding of the effects of managers’ disclosure strategy across multiple documents and have implications for regulators and standard setters’ work on a disclosure framework. Chapter III is entitled “Management Guidance at the Segment Level.” Prior research has found that managers add information to their earnings guidance to justify, explain, or contextualize their forecasts. I identify segment-level guidance (SLG) as a type of disaggregated information that multi-segment firms provide with their management guidance, and investigate its usefulness for financial analysts’ earnings forecasting accuracy, as well as its influence on managers’ earnings fixation. I further characterize the level of precision (point and range, maximum or minimum estimate, or simply narrative) and of disaggregation of SLG. I find that companies in high tech industries known for increased uncertainty in future performance are less likely to provide SLG, and that SLG is associated with better forecasting accuracy. However, while providing more item-disaggregated SLG improves accuracy, increased precision has no impact on forecast accuracy. From the manager’s point of view, SLG creates incentives to engage in earnings management, and the more precise the SLG is the greater the incentive. In contrast, more item-disaggregated SLG discourages earnings management, perhaps by improving monitoring. In a context where qualitative, narrative, and disaggregated guidance is regarded as a solution to avoid earnings fixation and short termism, understanding which types of information achieve this goal, and how, is relevant for managers, investors, and regulators alike."
"This present study aims at the influence of culture by applying five cultural dimensions:power distance, individualism versus collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, uncertaintyavoidance, and long-term orientation, to study their relationships with work engagement inorder to create the work engagement model driven by culture and orientation to workaholism.The study had been done in 48 companies in automobile, electronic and electronic, and hotelsectors in Thailand, with 403 participants. The result shows the score of three cultural dimensionsinclude power distance, masculinity, and long-term orientation are moderate to high, individualismis moderate to low, and uncertain voidance score is low. In addition to the powerdistance and individualism levels are varied according to educational levels. Furthermore, thework engagement level among participants is moderate to high, while workaholism level ismoderate to low, and the work engagement levels are difference between single and marriedgroup. The influence of masculinity had been found in work engagement and workaholism,thus masculinity culture can drive work engagement and workaholism. In addition to, there isno relationship between work engagement and workaholism."
"This Ph.D dissertation addresses different issues concerning communication and information transmission in a game theoretical framework. I analyze different dilemmas that a player who sends information has to deal with. These dilemmas correspond to the following questions: ""Should I invest into a verifiable message?"", ""When should I pass my information?"" and ""Is it better if I do not send my information, but collect information from others?"". This thesis includes an introduction and three chapters. The introduction contains a general motivation for the three different problems that I model in this thesis. I give a detailed overview of all the chapters, survey the related literature and compare it to my results."
"This dissertation offers an empirical investigation of the links between the political sphere and the management of local public services in France. When they administer public services, local governments can decide either to provide a service in-house, or to externalize its management, and therefore conclude contracts with private entities. First, this choice of governance is analyzed in the case of French school canteens and the political drivers of this choice are highlighted. The political contestation in the municipal election is found to be one of the drivers of the organizational choice. Second, we analyzed public-private contracts in case of externalization. We found those contracts to be more rigid than pure private contracts. Besides, this excessive rigidity can be explained by the level of political contestation in the municipality. Finally, the determinants of the local food supply is studied. We find that the availability of alternative food networks is sometimes driven by political considerations. This dissertation contributes to add knowledge to the understanding of the management of local public services, as well as to the understanding of food retail stores availability."
"The discounted utility theory proposed by Samuelson (1937) is one of the dominant paradigms in economics and management especially in finance where it serves as a basis of the Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) and its version including consumption (ICCAPM). Despite this place, its validity has a framework to explain individuals time preferences has been questioned in recents researches paving the way for amendments and questionings of this framework. Among others, these reseaches introduce the concept of term structure of psychological discount rate. Therefore, a part from exponential discount rate function, we find in the literature seven alternatives discount rate function : Hernstein, proportional, Laibson, Rachlin, Hyperbolic and generalized hyperbolic.Following this work, we initiated a research to provide an answer to the question on the characteristics and driving factors those explain its heterogeneity at an individual level. Thereafter, its relationship with other dimensions of individual preferences (risk and social interaction behavior) are explored. The purpose is to identify among them, the function that is consistent with the observed time preferences, to estimate the underlying parameters and to study the consistency of individual time preference. This research is based on the data collected by experimental study using eighteen time trade-offs, four lottery trade-offs, a dictator game, an ultimatum game and a trust game.Data analysis confirmed previous results on the violation of the time invariant of the psychological value of time hypothesis and established that the studied population is characterized by an heterogeneity with respect to the form of the term structure of psychological discount rate. Individuals are characterized by an Hernstein, Generalized hyperbolic or Laibson psychological discount rate. We found that demographic, social and temporal orientation have a weak link with the individual differences of the term structure of psychological discount rate. Application (a dimension of personality traits) is the most important driving factor of term structure of psychological discount rate forms heterogeneity. We finally established that there is a weak relationship between the parameters of time, risk and social preferences."
"As the economy or politics face new challenges, the question of the origin of products often surfaces in the media and becomes a focus of attention. For several decades, academics have studied the effects of origin on consumers’ attitudes towards products. However, globalization and commercial practices contribute to generating an environment unfavorable to full awareness of such information. This leads to a gap between reality and many research studies, still subscribing to the paradigm of a fully rational individual and to cognitive models of deliberate information processing. The objective of this research is to reach a better understanding of how made-in effects occur in a more natural consumption context.We first conduct a critical literature review highlighting prevailing approaches of an essentially cognitive nature, in spite of the emergence of affective elements sparking debates on a paradigm shift. This leads us to recognize the importance of a chronic country-related affect associated to a product’s country of origin. Building on the stereotype content model and the construal level theory, we develop our research hypotheses on the combined effects of affective and cognitive associations to this country, its products and its nationals, on consumers’ evaluations of the product.We then detail our experimental design, proceed to preliminary controls of collected data, and present the tests of our hypotheses and our main results. They reveal both direct and indirect effects of chronic country-related affect on the evaluations of products. These effects differ depending on consumers’ perceptions of the nationals and of the products from the country of origin."
"This thesis studies probability distortion in clinical judgment to compare physicians’ judgment with statistical models. We considered that physicians form their clinical judgment by integrating an analytical component and an intuitive component. We documented that physicians may suffer from several biases in the way they evaluate and integrate the two components. This dissertation gathers findings from the field and the lab. With actual medical data practice, we found that physicians were not as good as the statistical models at integrating consistently medical evidence. They over­estimated small probabilities that the patient had the disease and under­ estimated large probabilities. We found that their biased probability judgment might cause unnecessary health care treatment. How then can we improve physician judgment? First, we considered to replace physician judgment by the probability generated from our statistical model. To actually improve decision it was necessary to develop a statistical score that combines the analytical model, the intuitive component of the physician and his observed deviation from the expected decision. Second, we tested in the lab factors that may affect information processing. We found that participants’ ability to learn about the value of the analytical component, without external feedback, depends on the quality of their intuitive component and their working memory. We also found that participants’ ability to integrate both components together depends on their working memory but not their evaluation of the intuitive component."
"This thesis seeks to demonstrate that improved Environmental Performance (EP), through the implementation of eco-innovative initiatives , positively influences Financial Performance ( FP) of a company. As basic hypothesis, we chose that of Porter ( 1991), which emphasizes the benefits of implementing environmental strategies respecting the principle of sustainable development. This hypothesis is totally opposed to the neoclassical vision that considers the costs of environmental protection as additional and excessive costs that may hamper the company's economic development. To validate our research hypothesis , we chose to test econometrically , through the method of linear regression, the relationship between EP and FP choosing as EP indicators, environmental investments and expenses (IE), the percentage of certified fiber (CF) and the ""Sustainable Value""Environment indexes, relative to each of the environmental resources. These indexes are calculated using the approach ""Sustainable Value"" destined to evaluate the corporate sustainability and who represents an application of reasoning of classical financial analysis to environmental resources. We chose to conduct this study in a static and dynamic perspectives in order to assess the effects of EP on FP in a short and a medium term, through the evaluation of both the current effect and the  one and two years delayed effect of the EP in FP. The results thus released from the econometric study provided a validation of our main research hypothesis , stating that a good EP influence positively the FP and the profitability of the Company.We note that the environmental initiatives are profitable since the first year of their implementation, except that the intensity of this profit varies according to the nature of Eco-innovation (Eco-innovation product, Eco-innovation process) and according to the characteristics of each company."
"Anthropic Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG), when concentrating in the atmosphere, cause climate change. The increase in greenhouse gases, including CO2 emissions in transport activity in general and freight transport in particular of contribute to global warming. Transportation is responsible for an increasing part of these emissions, mainly road transport and within transport; the share of goods (about one third) is increasing. Currently, a large and growing share of freight transport is organized by a few large retailers seeking to control logistics flows even further upstream and to organize theses flows for their own benefit.The main aim of the thesis is a contribution to a better understanding of energy consumption and carbon (CO2) emissions in the transportation of goods. For this, the thesis analyzes the energy and carbon efficiencies of various forms of supply chains implemented by major retailers in Vietnam and compares them with the corresponding supply chains in France. Hanoi is a very fast developing city since the opening of the economy in 1986. The economic development has drawn increasing population in the dense major urban areas, the motorization of transport and dramatic changes in the distribution and in the supply chains organization.The starting point of the thesis is a research result on quantifying energy and GHG emissions from supply chains in France and in Europe. We conducted surveys on the corresponding supply chains of Vietnamese distributions to obtain comparable data and quantify the energy consumption and emissions of CO2 by applying the quantification method used in France. This allows us to compare the energy and carbon efficiency of different forms of retail outlets in the cases studied of yoghurt and blue jeans between Vietnam and France.A survey was conducted face to face with the operators (producers, transporters, distributors) and a Web survey with consumers (in shopping trips) in Vietnam have bought these products in these retail outlets. Using the information collected in Hanoi, we describe the supply chains of yoghurt and jeans in Vietnam from the raw material up to the consumer's home. The differences between types of distribution or supply chains, relate in particular to the type of retail outlets: a shop can belong to the producer in Vietnam, a retailer in France or an independent shop and the supermarket and hypermarket to major distributors.Through these analyzes, we answer the following questions: What are the most efficient logistic organizations for energy and CO2 emissions of retail outlets? Energy consumptions in this analysis are diesel, gasoline, electricity and sometimes gas. For these different energies, we use the emission factors of the ‘CO2 in transport services Information Guide’ (ADEME 2012) and for electricity in Vietnam, the emission factor published by the Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment of Vietnam (2010)."
"Even though sustainable development continues to grow, it is difficult to implement in a company’s everyday operations. Particularly, the sector of transportation and logistics is struggling to reduce its environmental and social impacts. This research aims to compare the theoretical foundations of sustainable development to the practices of a Third Party Logistics Provider ""3PL"". It helps to understand the process of the emergence of a sustainable development policy in a business: Corporate Social Responsibility ""CSR"" and to participate in the development of projects that highlight the tensions between environmental or social impacts and the economic imperative.   The result is a new approach to put into practice sustainable development through improvement and optimization projects related to the business at different levels (strategic, tactical and operational) and in several areas (transportation, handling and storage). Mix integer programming optimization model for platform location and flows assignment, vehicle routing and data analysis of eco-driving have been developed and applied in the company for this purpose. The cases studied in this thesis show that for some types of projects, economic interest and response to the requirements of CSR evolve in the same direction. For others, a compromise between the economic, social and environmental factors could be a good solution pending new technologies that would ensure sustainable solutions."
"AThis thesis is composed by two papers focusing on two-level supply chains with a monopoly supplier and N clients whose demands for the same products are correlated. The first paper studies the simultaneous impact of vertical and horizontal cooperation on the overall performance and the stability of the chain. It proposes an individual-centered multi-agents approach for studying the impact on performance of different kinds of customer behaviors associated with overstock risk and their interaction rules under possible distortion of the exchanged information. The second paper deals with pharmaceutical distribution and studies the influence of the cooperation between wholesale distributors and a unique supplier to reduce overstocks and wastes. More generally, this thesis has shown the relevance of a connectionist approach of complex supply chains with heterogeneous agents exchanging information."
"Today, France is dotted with more than 2 000 music festivals, which represent important social and economic issues, threatened by the combination of a funding decreasing and charges increasing. Far from trivial, this finding has a special resonance for the management researcher who saw these music festivals as an extreme case of pervasive organizational form: the Temporary Organizations (TO). In this context, the thesis work on understanding the articulation between organizational continuity and logistics management in the TO to try to identify the impact of this relation on continuation of TO with repetitive projects like music festivals but also like humanitarians or military interventions. A research question can then be asked: "" How organizational continuity and logistics management can they jointly contribute to the continuation of a temporary organization ?"". The thesis is supported by a qualitative methodology based on four case studies of French actual music festivals and is split in two parts: the first one focused on the organizational continuity and highlight a pulsatory phenomena which lead to evolutions of the structures and the ways of coordination in the organization, the second part is focused on the logistics management and show the strategic place of the logistics competencies on the continuation of TO. At the end, the thesis show that one of the most important challenge for music festival managers resides in the development, the conservation, and the mobilisation of specifics logistics competencies, especially in transitional phases in upstream and downstream of the events."
"Logistics networks intensely use transportation means and storage facilities to respond to ‎supply chain's demands. However, these networks are overwhelmingly dedicated to an actor ‎and are therefore poorly interconnected. This fragmentation explains the lack of consolidation ‎and thus efficiency. To cope with the seeming antagonism between atomized freight and the ‎objective of the European Commission to drastically reduce CO2 emissions, a major ‎improvement in supply networks is sought. We propose then to interconnect ‎logistics networks ‎like the Digital Internet did with computer networks. The first objective of this thesis is to ‎contribute to the definition of the first key elements of logistics networks interconnection‎. To this ‎purpose, ‎we explore the possible transpositions between computer networks, in ‎particular ‎Internet, and ‎logistic networks. In fact, there are strong similarities between these ‎networks in ‎spite of the basic differences in the type of objects.Beyond Physical Internet concepts and proposed methods, no demonstration of the potential of ‎interconnected logistics networks has been carried out. This is precisely the second objective of ‎this work to assess the associated stakes. To reach this goal, we use a set of actual flows from ‎the Fast Moving Consumer Goods sector (FMCG) in France. Various transportation protocols ‎and scenarios are tested, revealing encouraging with gains in CO2 emissions, cost, and so ‎forth. As this is a first work in the field of interconnected logistics networks, the simulation ‎model suggests many further research avenues."
"As the result of the more and more ambitious production and marketing strategies,such as Just-In-Time and increasing customization of products, the current vertical logistics collaboration approaches based on single supply chain seems insufficient to achieve further improvements in transportation efficiency. The horizontal logistics collaboration (HLC), which has been proved an effective approach to efficiency improvement, has attracted both academics and practitioners. One of the main barriers to the implementation of HLCs is the lack of feasible collaboration mechanism, in particular the gain sharing mechanism. We identify two organizational forms of HLCs: the centralized and decentralized ones. For centralized HLCs, we propose a collaboration model that is a collaboration conducting process integrating decision-aiding tools to guide the implementation of the collaboration. We also develop a generally applicable game-theoretic sharing mechanism for different categories of centralized HLCs modeled as super-additive and non-super-additive cooperative games. This sharing mechanism takes into account the collaborators' contribution, the coalition stability, and the bargaining power to propose a credible sharing scheme for collaborators. The approach is illustrated by numerical example taken from logistics cases. For the implementation of the decentralized HLCs, we propose an open collaborative logistics framework, and design the system protocols as the collaboration mechanism that specifies the combinatorial-auction-based request allocation and payment determination to foster the collaborations."
"Irrespective of significant performance achieved, today’s logistics networks are overwhelmingly dedicated to an actor and therefore poorly interconnected. This fragmentation exhibits inevitable inefficiency and needs to be changed in respond to today’s new arising challenges in efficiency and resilience. To solve this antagonism, an innovative concept - Physical Internet (PI) - has been proposed which is a fully interconnected, open, dynamic logistics system. In such a system, the facilities and means of transportation can be dynamically organized and allocated in the short-term or long-term according to the economic environment. As a result, decisions can be made dynamically, agilely, and thus optimally. This thesis studies the perspectives of the PI to inventory management and transportation regarding the challenges in efficiency and resilience.As the efficiency of the PI to transportation has been carried out in literature, the first objective of this thesis is to explore the potentials of the PI to inventory management. To this end, we firstly qualitatively examine the new practices brought by the PI and conclude three main characteristics: 1) Distributed stocks near end customers; 2) Transshipment of inventories; and 3) multiple dynamic source options. Corresponding inventory models and solutions are proposed and evaluated with numerical experiments in Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG). This part of study gives a guideline for the vendors applying the PI to make inventory decisions in such an open logistic system.The second objective is to analyze the resilience of the proposed PI enabled inventory and transportation model confronted to disruptions. The proposed inventory and transportation model are extended with different disruptions at facilities including plants and hubs. Different disruption strategies are developed. Numerical studies in FMCG are carried out.In a word, this research investigates the inventory management in the PI and the resilience of PI enabled logistics models. It is the first time such a work is done and it should be upfront. From the results of studies, there is no doubt that the PI changes today’s supply chains design and improve the performance of supply chain management both in efficiency, effectiveness and resilience."
"Nowadays, a firm cannot meet its customers' requirements alone. It needs to rely on its Supply Chain : its providers, the providers of its providers, and the distributors.In this framework, the literature highlights the actors’ proneness to align their behaviors and to opt for a global behavior that integrates physical, informational and managerial characteristics. The purpose of this research is to understand by which coordination instruments does this postulate is carried out? On the other hand, these coordination instruments (contract, trust, power or opportunism), which often find their substance in the interpersonal relationships, feed a literature that tends to let one think that the idea of a behavioral alignment is not bearable in the interfirm relationships.To understand the interfirm relationships and its instruments in the automotive supply chain, we have explored a literature review on the firm, the interfirm relationships and the place granted to each coordination instrument. We also showed the specificity of the SCM concept, and more widely the Supply Chain concept. Then, a case study registered in a comprehensive approach, in Dumez sense (2014), constituted the empirical phases of our research. The confrontation of the theoretical material with the empirical material brought three ideal types of relationships to the foreground (Collaboration, Coordination and Transactional), whose instruments change from one to another, and differ if we are upstream or downstream. Within the same idealtype, and the same actors, there are ascendants (towards the customers) or descendants (towards the providers) instruments. This research has rested on the works on the leadership decisive role, on one hand in the building of a collaborative relationship with the providers and, on the other hand, its impact on the definition of the relationship measure. It also demonstrated that the place of the culture in the interfirm relationships is not always the same, but changes depending on the organizational system of the firm. Finally, this research shows the correlation between the organizational system building of the firms within each idealtype, and the five following main factors : the asset specificity, the product technicality, the time, the quality and the price."
"This research work aims to suggest a methodology for analyzing the innovation and export capabilities of SMEs working in the manufacturing and process sectors.  This methodology is based on the identification and the characterization of a conceptual innovation/export common space representing the activities, the resources, the skills that a SME has to mobilize first and foremost in order to improve in a simultaneous way its performances concerning innovation and export. Working on the activities included in the common space allows the reduction of the effort associated with this performance improvement. This work contributes to the scientific research through various aspects. First of all, the innovation / export relationship in SMEs, traditionally thought in a causal way, was envisaged through the prism of the complexity paradigm. This theoretical contribution allowed the identification of an innovation/export common space. Then, this common space was characterized through the identification of joint activities. The identification of these joint activities is both a theoretical and managerial contribution because by improving one of these activities, companies activate a single lever which echoes simultaneously on innovation and export capabilities. In the context of SMEs, for whom the lack of resources is a major difficulty, it makes perfect sense. Finally, an evaluation methodology of the innovation and export capabilities based on this common space was designed so as to propose a multicriteria decision-making tool dedicated to SMEs. This tool was finally tested within manufacturing and process SMEs of the Lorraine region"
"This dissertation aims to investigate the different mechanisms of value creation within horizontal mergers. Three theoretical perspectives are considered : 1) the micro-economic approach based on scale economies, 2) the io approach based on the notion of market power, and 3) the resource-based view of the firm. The results show the relevance to take into account the resource-based view to account for motivations of horizontal mergers and to validate the limitations associated with traditional theories based on economy of scale and market power.

"The purpose of this work is to extend the arbitrage pricing theory in the international context, to provide a fruitful alternative to the international asset pricing models. First of all, we show the arbitrage pricing equation is not exactly verified. However, and in spite of some problems, the model is theoritically coherent, and it is testable. Thus, we have carried out an empirical analysis of this model with samples of ten countries. This test rejects the model for four countries. In a second part, we propose an international version of the arbitrage pricing theory. In this international model, new factors reflect return translation in an other currency and these factors are appreciated. The relation between factors coefficients when measured in different currencies has been investigated, as well as the pricing of the forward exchange rates which depends on the covariance of the currency fluctuation with the same common factors. A test of the international model with two international sample indicates that two to four risk premia are not null, consequently, the model is not rejected. Thus, it seemed interesting to perform an empirical analysis of the financial integration in the theorical framework of this model. Our conclusion is that the world capital market is not integrated. At last, a tentative of economic interpretation of factors is realized. . . "
"The relocation of the luxury sector is, even nowadays, still difficult to comprehend. On one hand, this complexity is due to the concept of luxury which is not easy to define, and on the other hand, it is due to the topic’s sensitivity which is still taboo in the luxury sector. Yet there have been several cases of luxury relocations. Considering the imaginative world represented by luxury brands, we should look at the impact of relocation on consumers, notably their attitudes towards the product and the brand. This thesis is a first research study on the question of relocating French luxury brands. It uses both the theories about luxury and brands as areas of application, and the literature on the Country-of-Origin Effect as a theoretical framework. Our research studies the effect of relocation on consumers’ attitudes towards the relocated product and luxury brand. The moderating influence of two new variables has been taken into account, i.e. the centrality of the country of origin at the heart of the brand image and consumers’ attitudes towards luxury relocation. In terms of methodology, two qualitative surveys were carried out: one on consumers (17), the other on luxury professionals (34). These were followed by a quantitative survey using a sample of 555 consumers. The survey was carried out in two parts, based on a complete factorial design. Our research therefore brings out the negative impact of luxury relocation upon attitudes to the relocated product and brand. This effect is even more noticeable in the case of production relocation in comparison with design one or when the French origin is abandoned for an unacceptable country of manufacture. In this case, the effect is felt more on the perceived quality than the two other attitudinal variables. The impact of the moderating variables comes out as a limited one."
"As nations around the world become closer and increasingly interdependent, the changing global context requires a parallel advancement of academic research. Theories developed for advanced democracies in the twentieth century now require complimentary additions, or perhaps diverging counterparts, to help explain the developmental processes of developing countries. To address these changes, scholars have created new theories or extended old ones to consider developing countries. However, despite the positive and thorough advancements thus far, the dynamic nature of countries undergoing development and transition, both economic and political, means that the work is far from finished. The literature on institutional developments in the political economy for advanced democracies is, while still evolving, well established. The theories supporting the research within this thesis rely on comparative capitalism studies and the varieties of capitalism approach focused on advanced democracies. The purpose of this thesis is, using the key tenants of comparative capitalism and the varieties of capitalism theory, to expand this literature to developing countries. After the introduction found in chapter one, chapter two suggests that developing countries with more coordinated economies should have more proportional electoral rule systems, which are a type of political institution. Chapter three continues along the idea of this subject by suggesting that these coordinated economies, which have more proportional electoral rules systems, according to chapter two, should produce more generous welfare states with higher government spending and more optimal welfare outcomes, such as low inequalities and low levels of poverty. This connective story can be explained by the co-evolution of economic and political institutions. In order to understand more deeply welfare state formation and variety, along with how welfare generosity affects welfare outcomes in developing countries, chapter four takes a closer look at one region in particular, Sub­-Saharan Africa."
"Domestic violence affects the health of individuals, influences their behaviour in the workplace, and impacts organisations. In addition to financial loss, it contributes to emphasize gender inequalities, especially within the professional sphere. Througha typology of the implications of domestic violence, this exploratory research examines the processes in motion during the interactions of victims with their professional environment, and how organisations can respond to the manifestations of this phenomenon which occurs within the family sphere. It is based on a double conceptual framework: domestic violence and work-family articulation. Field access relies on a combination of qualitative methods: 47 interviews (semi-directive individual and collective interviews, life histories) lead with victims as well as with representatives of non-mercantile organisations (associations, Kering Foundation,conseil général de l’Essonne) and businesses (PSA Peugeot-Citroën, BPI group).Besides this innovative theoretical anchoring, the results have allowed the emergence of a model that articulates the family determinant (acts of physical,psychological, and economic violence), the work-family relationship (spill over,conflict, and compensation) as well as the three main organisational effects (decrease in concentration, change in behaviour, and over investment in work). Amongst those three manifestations, the decrease in concentration (negative spill over) and the over investment in work (compensation) are significant elements in terms of the number of people concerned; the change in behaviour (negative spill over) represents a remarkable variable because of its unexplored character. Following logics of integration or respect, the organisations are likely to contribute to reducing the difficulties posed by these interferences, thus receiving economic and managerial benefits.The contributions of the study are found on several levels: on one hand it imports into France the issue of the organisational implications of domestic violence,and on the other, it positions it within the theoretical framework of the work-family relationship."
"Inspired by the lack of research on the practices of knowledge managers in the literature and the existing dominance of the building mode in strategy-as-practice research, this thesis has two attempts. One is to examine how the knowledge managers, as strategizing practitioners, do their job via intentional doing and practical coping in their particular context. Another is to understand how knowledge managers, as strategizing practitioners, live in their position. To develop an investigation framework, this thesis relies on the pragmatic theory of John Dewey, especially his perspective on the transactional relationship between man and the environment. The empirical investigation is carried out based on the six inter-related procedures put forward by van Manen (1990), which are in line with the spirit of hermeneutic phenomenology. Seven knowledge managers of a multinational, who work in different countries, including France, Austria, China, and Canada, were interviewed during two sessions of two hours. The interviews are semi-structured. The interpretation process relies on the model proposed by Benner (1994), which performs cross-case thematic analysis to show the common threads between the stories of the knowledge managers, and studies the paradigm cases using withincase analysis to understand the individuality of each story. Exemplars are used to convey the different aspects of the themes and paradigm cases presented. Validity is enhanced by internal verification and testing of interpretive description, craftsmanship quality (Kvale, 1996), and a validation of findings by the participant. An “audit trail” (Koch, 1994) is kept to help the reader follow the rationale of the researcher’s interpretations. The analysis reveals that the main particularity of knowledge management is that it is a new function. The knowledge managers have to build a place for the knowledge management function through a strategizing process to gain acceptance. The knowledge managers can be compared with the rafters on an angry river, with the river indicating the organizational context, and the rafting representing the strategizing process. The knowledge managers, as the rafters, are carried on as well as endangered by the current. They fight to protect their inflatable boat from sinking by trying to avoid the obstacles and taking advantage of what is useful for them on the river. From the cross-case thematic analysis, the strategizing actions, undertaken by the knowledge managers, are grouped into three categories: intentional, emergent, and constraint-responding. They are labelled marketing, island-finding, and force-building, respectively. From the paradigm-case analysis, the knowledge managers are divided into three groups based on their capability to survive the turbulent organizational context and build a territory for the knowledge management function. Among the seven knowledge manager, one has decided to give up the position, four are still struggling with the obstacles and the powerful current to obtain a place within the organizational life, and two have achieved certain success. They are named the defeated, the struggling, and the contented, respectively."
"This thesis investigates the key drivers of rural households’ choices of livelihoods, and how these choices impact forest clearing and biodiversity conservation under a landscape approach. Using a novel and unique database obtained from a face-to-face survey with a representative sample of 1035 households in the Dja-Odzala-Minkébé trinational transboundary conservation landscape (Tridom-TCL)- Congo basin , this PhD thesis address three main questions investigated in three chapters. Using a spatial probit model, the first chapter investigates “how do local and indigenous households formulate their preferences among livelihoods strategies?” Using a spatial lag model, the second chapter investigates “how and how much do these livelihoods strategies, given wildlife constrains such as human-wildlife conflicts, impact smallscale deforestation?” Using corner solution models, the third chapter investigates ""how the nature of the interactions among households and wildlife, the households’ main activities as well as their land holdings impact their willingness to pay to prevent endangered forest elephant extinction?”Among other, we find that livelihoods strategies are determined by autochthonous status, financial assets (money transfer and access to loan), distance to market and larger crop losses resulting from human-wildlife conflicts. Further, we show that livelihoods strategies are important for deforestation. Therefore, the commitments to reducing small-scale deforestation may be favored by a good consideration of factors that drive households’ livelihoods strategies. We find out that spatial issues seem to be important. Proximity among households yields spatial shift effects and spatial spillover effects that are likely to amplify small-scale deforestation. We also argue that, cross-cutting solutions towards a sustainable landscape considering these three crucial issues involve optimizing trade-off between households’ livelihoods strategies, forest and the natural habitats of fauna. Therefore, the issues of community land security, of where natural habitat is needed and of how it should be managed are at the core of the problem. For example, decision-makers should proceed with the integration of large mammals mobility corridors far away from the community settlements in order to enhance zero-conflict-oriented elephant habitats; corridors should be consistently placed relatively to high elephant-concentration zones without crossing into zones with denser human populations."
"The aim of this study is not only to consider success factors in internationalization, but more particularly success factors for sales in the context of internationalization, in other words, the real kernel of success in internationalization. Basically, there is no available research on success factors in the process of export sales, i.e. more in-depth research on general success factors in sales processes. The research discussed on this question has been examined on two levels: the organizational level and the individual level. The survey covered 788 Swiss SMEs, in which 876 people were questioned. Close to 80% of those questioned were the CEOs of the companies which participated in the survey, while 20% were members of Senior Management. The view of the ensemble of the quantitative and qualitative analysis produces a relatively coherent result: companies that are successful fundamentally act in a more personal and individualized manner in the different dimensions, such as the number of distribution channels, the number of market processing strategies, the focus on a more limited product range, the development and the importance of the employee in the sale and individualized sales process which is based on the client and not on standardized instruments (sales techniques, standardized presentation materials etc.). This tendency was also highlighted in the literature coming from the research in the field of success factors and research into entrepreneurship in the field of internationalization"
"This study is about cycles. Various cycles are all around us in nature, society and the humans body. However, our interest is in cycles in macroeconomic evolution. Specifically, we focus on business cycles, financial cycles, energy demand cycles and even in climatic change.Some cycles are very regular and therefore easily predictable. The cycles we investigate represent a distinct challenge for research as they are irregular, that is they do not have fixed periods. In many instances studying the cycles is preferred to studying the original as this allows the following:•	Data compression/reduction;•	Data smoothing, noise reduction, blurring;•	Analysis of cycles in many instances is more robust;•	Assessing performance of an investor or trader;•	Modelling of peaks and troughs;•	Comparing cycles (e.g. for synchronisation analysis).In our investigations we used a wide range of techniques – from quite straightforward linear regression (including proposed double-linear or LL-model) to sophisticated hybrid models, combining multivariate regression with artificial neural networks (ANN).The following highlights are mentionable:•	Introduction of the concept of axiomatic definition of persistence;•	The role of the Hurst exponent in analysis of cycles;•	Establishing the link between axiomatic persistence and the Hurst exponent;•	New fast method for estimation of Hurst exponent;•	Hierarchical optimal dating of cycles in time series;•	Hierarchical estimation of time series models, including ANN estimation.For our research we used both real data related to the South African national economy and simulated data. Wolfram Mathematica was used as the principal research tool."
The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) engaged in the elaboration of set of accounting standards in response to the growing need for financial reporting harmonization. Although the standardization process serves the public interest by relying on a Due Process allowing the participation of all stakeholders interested many studies analyzing the same process in the private sector reveal that this standards development procedure is not democratic.This research ensures continuity to studies undertaken in the private accounting context and analyzes the IPSASB Due Process. After highlighting the relevance of the participatory democracy approach the study mobilizes the three-dimensional theory of Lukes' power (1974 [2005]) in order to understand the phases preceding the development of the public accounting conceptual framework. The participatory process analysis involves identifying respondents and their change requests using thematic content analysis method. The study compares then different versions of the conceptual framework document in order to appreciate the sensitivity of the IPSASB to the comments addressed by the participants.  This study emphasizes that changes brought by the IPSASB in response to the commentaries received during the Due Process remain minor ones. The Due Process appears then as a conservative mechanism that permits conflict avoidance and a consensus building strategy
"The exposition of this thesis is based on three parts. First, production technologies are analysed with respect toseveral axiomatic approaches. The B-disposability property is introduced in order to give a more general definition ofthe pollution-generating technologies. This methodological innovation aims to reveal pollution-generating technologiescompatible with a minimal set of assumptions. Then, a more general class of pollution-generating technologiessatisfying both convex and non-convex axioms, can be defined. Furthermore, this axiomatic contribution allows toconsider inputs and outputs partitions, which is of particular interest in empirical studies. The second part of thiswork concerns the measurement of technical efficiency. Then, generalised distance functions are introduced in B-disposable production sets. Following these results, several tests are suggested in order to characterize the structure ofB-disposable production technologies. Moreover, innovative duality results are proposed based on the B-disposabilityproperty. This considerably weakens classical duality results based upon usual disposal assumptions. In the thirdpart, productivity change is studied. Generalisation of additive and multiplicative complete eco-productivity measures,are introduced. Following non-parametric technologies, a procedure to implement the generalised eco-productivitymeasures is exposed. This process is based on the non-parametric estimation of the generalised distance functionssuggested in this work."
"This thesis aims to present two efficiency measures. First, a log-additive distance function is introduced. It is dual to non-linear pseudo cost, revenue and profit functions. This structure means that the relation between factors and products is not constant. Moreover, exponential Luenberger (Chambers, Färe and Grosskopf (1996)) and Luenberger-Hicks-Moorsteen (Briec and Kerstens (2004)) indicators are proposed. Second, a non-linear distance function is defined. It inherits thestructure of CES (Solow (1956)) and CET (Powell and Gruen (1968))functions. The duality theory allows to present non-linear cost, revenue and profit functions. In this sense, non-linear adjusted price functions are deduced. Non-linear prices occur when the production unit faces internal and/or non-linear tariffs. The alpha-returns to scale model (Boussemart, Briec, Peypoch and Tavéra (2009)) is applied to this new non-linear efficiency measure. Indeed, it is shown that returns-to-scale impact efficiency of production units."
"Extreme events have a material impact on return distributions and investment decisions. However, the role of event risks is understated in popular financial decision making approaches. This thesis includes event risks into investment decisions to improve global investment optimality. We examine event risks in two different but coherent financial settings: portfolio selection and corporate finance. In the portfolio selection setting, we focus on the incorporation of higher order information to capture the impact of event risks on portfolio construction. Higher order extensions are implemented on two main portfolio optimization methods: the classic framework of mean variance optimization and CAPM, and the stochastic dominance approach. We find that the inclusion of higher order information improves global portfolio optimality given the presence of event risks. As a special case, we combine the traditional applications of mean variance optimization and stochastic dominance analysis to examine the index efficiency of DJIA. We find that DJIA is efficient as a performance benchmark. In the corporate finance setting, we principally identified corporate name changes of M&As among the S&P 500 index, and examined how the name change events impact the return patterns for the acquirers and the targets. Conducting this corporate event study, we show that name changeevents substantially affect return dynamics, and that the abnormal return difference between name change events and non name change events is economically and statistically significant. Generally, our studies illustrate that the inclusion of event risks in decision processes brings important benefits to the asset allocation optimization."
"The Thesis aims at evaluating monetary policy in presence of financial frictions both from an empirical and structural perspective. Along those lines, multi-variate time-series framework as well as model with more explicit theoretical foundations will be deployed. The Thesis presents original contributions in various fields of monetary and financial macroeconomics.The main motivation for the applied research presented in this Thesis are twofold. It responded both to the need for deeper research on macro-financial linkages and to the growing interest of policy institutions for the model-based policy advise. First, the Great recession and in particular, the typology of crisis episodes in Europe over the last decade, unveiled new challenges for monetary policy conduct, notably related to the prevalence of financial factors in cyclical fluctuations, the design of non-standard measures and the interactions with financial service policies. The second motivation has to do with the growing role for structural models in the preparation of monetary policy within central banks. Over the last decades, academic research and central bank practices have mutually benefited from strong synergies, whereby quantitative methods and theoretical advances have had a lasting influence on main preparation avenues for monetary policy making.In Chapter 1, a set of empirical studies intend to demonstrate the prevalence of financial shocks underlying the euro area macroeconomic performance during the Great recession. In particular, BVAR models can identify credit supply shocks and quantify their contribution to the various recessionary episodes over the last decade.Thereafter, Chapter 2 explores more structurally the transmission mechanism of financial shocks together with their heterogeneity across the euro area through the lens of DSGE models featuring a relevant set of demand-side as well as supply-side credit frictions.Against this background, the Thesis examine more normative aspects of monetary policy conduct starting with derivation of optimal monetary policy in selected DSGE models, which is the focus of Chapter 3. The Ramsey approach to optimal monetary provides a clear benchmark for formulating normative prescriptions. We analyse the main properties of the Ramsey allocation within a set of quantitative DSGE models, thereby bring new insight on various closed economy and open economy policy challenges.At times of crisis, as financial-driven recessions bring the monetary policy interest rates to their effective lower bound, central bank deployed a set of non-standard measures in order to engineer the intended policy accommodation. Chapter 4 presents several studies which extend DSGE models to analyse the role of non-standard monetary policy measures like asset purchase programmes or long-term liquidity operations. The credit channel of those measures will be the focus of the analysis. From a more normative standpoint, the optimal central bank asset purchase strategy will be derived.Finally, in Chapter 5, the normative assessment of monetary policy conduct in presence of financial frictions calls for considering strategic interactions with other policies, and notably macroprudential policy. Such interactions are all the more relevant when analysed in a monetary union context through multi-country DSGE models."
"TPE are playing an important role in the French economic dynamism. Each year, thousands of them are transmitted. This phenomenon is not new, but the demographic evolution of French TPE leadership tends to create a major concern for political and economic decision makers. The majority of them and, for a growing share ours times by external individuals buyers with no connection to the company. The development of this type of transmission is not coming without its problems. Ignorance of the company, its environment by the buyer increases the already great difficulties of the recovery (Deschamps and Paturel, 2009). The arrival in the company of an external buyer is often experienced by employees as an interruption, a major organizational change that could jeopardize the continuation of the activity. The fact that the company is healthy at redemption interfere with the way the change is apprehended by the employees. This can be interpreted as a threat, the possibility of losing a satisfactory situation before. The specificities characterizing the TPE make the event particularly intense emotional and relational. This study aims to explore the inauguration of the buyer, the last step repreneurial process, through interaction between actors. Based on a multiple case study (10 cases analyzed, 31 interviews), the results show a process called collective reconstruction of post-recovery direction. They also show the existence of a number of individual, organizational and contextual factors with significant influence on the process."
"Financial markets are traditionally seen as places where demand for financing meets capacity. However, financial intermediaries have contributed to the growing complexity of transactions and to an emerging relational network within markets. The purpose of this PhD dissertation is to consider the Eurobond market as an organization in which members adopt rationalities along with diversified and evolving courses of action. We used a methodology based on historical events and on a long-run analysis of practices. Following an abductive approach, observations set out of this double perspective are confronted with conceptual frames based on organizational theories. This confrontation is led within three steps. First of all, the evolution and the practices are studied to show why and how the Eurobond market behaves as an organization and not only as a place devoted to transactions. Then, the organizational shapes that it adopts all along its history are identified. To finish with, as the “firm” seems to be its most recent morphology, it is necessary to examine its main coordination pattern. Actually, the Eurobond market appears to be a professional bureaucracy. As a matter of fact, predominating risks onto this place are not “market risks” any more. They mostly derive from typical organizational stakes: the behavioral control of members and management of changes.These research results should contribute to renew points of view on financial markets, since they tend to line up with what used to make the Eurobond market so unique. They may be a source of interest for the regulators who, from now one, face a limited ability to control financial intermediaries. These conclusions may also help borrowers to understand that, de facto, they presently deal more with a fund supplier than they finance onto a market."
"The future of a company is guaranteed by its ability to create new business relationships. The development of a repeating customer base assures autonomy, sustainability and visibility. This action of conquest often relies on the sales force. The salesman appears to be the key element to increase the value and number of new customers. Our research aims at defining and understanding the process of the first commercial relationship between a customer and a salesman. The mechanism of the initial sale is illustrated by the formalization of a model and assumptions are tested quantitatively on a sample of 81 buyers and 323 salesmen. A successful initial sale meets the economic and social expectations of the customer and the salesman. It ensures the transfer of property but also the creation of a social bond. The success of an initial business relationship is illustrated by the combination of transactional and relational dimensions. Our research focuses on the positive effects of transactional and relationship factors for both customers and salesmen on the rate of success of an initial sale. The trust, the quality of the relationship, humor, enhance the relationship between these antecedents and the success rate of the initial sale. This is a dynamic process influenced by each positive step of the initial sale. Our contributions give value to the theoretical structure of the sale and methodological approach to research sales. For the manager, our work offers multiple solutions to increase the efficiency of business development sales force."
"Cooperation has always been a fundamental issue of research on social organizations, whether human or animal. Thus, studies about cooperation are transversal to many disciplines: anthropology, sociology, psychology, economics, and management. Forms, reasons, motivations or barriers to joint actions of individuals are observed. The fields covered are as diverse as family, school, state, local or enterprise. Management is particularly interested in the latter, in its broadest sense, that of economic and social unit. This research is intended as a contribution to the study of this complex and fundamental phenomenon: cooperation between members of an organization. With the first part, we try to understand how cooperation appears and evolves within organizations. To do this, we answer the following questions: How to study cooperation in organizations? What cooperation? Why and how to cooperate? Cooperate with whom? Through the development and analysis of a database verbatim, and the study of intervention-research, cooperation is defined as a process by which actors move from their individual actions to collective action. Their practices, complex, protean are governed by two logics of action : the one based on the calculation, the other one on the identity. Cooperative practices are organized around three dimensions of organization : horizontal, transversal and vertical. The second part presents the results of the study variables of cooperation in their dynamics; it helps to clarify their links, to observe their development over time and indifferent types of organizational structure. This perspective is made possible by the longitudinal study of three organizations. It is central to this second part. We begin by studying the hierarchy in organizations. Two reasons motivate our choice. On the one hand, this study responds to questions raised in the previous section on the influence of the hierarchy in the dynamic cooperative. On the other hand, the three organizations in which the dynamics were observed are structured hierarchically. We then discuss the interactions between the different variables of cooperation, particularly between the horizontal, transversal and vertical dimensions, and identify levels for the development of cooperative practices. The study of these levels is then deepened and enriched with managerial implications."
"When a crisis occurs within a company, certain resources with particular characteristics emerge, helping those who suffer. We call these resources: “toxic handlers.”The role of this research is to understand what it is that “toxic handlers” do, why they help others in difficult. How do they do this? What can organizations do to help them? “Toxic handlers” rescue companies through an act compassion, but unfortunately they pay a heavy price for this. We have attempted to answer certain questions surrounding the creation process of compassionate resilience within companies.  How do individuals, who don’t appear to be suffering in the eyes of their companies, find themselves full of compassion for their close colleagues? We’re asking ourselves what happens to a toxic handler. Is he or she a “carrier of compassion or of suffering”? How does this compassion or suffering come about with regard to the “toxic handler”? Why can’t employees who suffer manage to front up to toxic emotions? How is the relation between the “toxic handler” and the “employees in pain” created? Toxic handlers act as intermediaries between “toxic boss” and “employees in pain.” The actions of “toxic handlers” are nonexistent within a company unless there is an internal crisis and only if the “toxic handler” is also facing a crisis (what we call a double crisis). We have created an analysis model for compassionate resilience and have applied it to several large companies suffering from a crisis. Our work opens a field of research and brings together numerous perspectives concerning the problematic of compassionate resilience within a company."
"Accounting profession characterized for a long time by relatively slow changes is facing major strategic challenges to sustainably align its performance on the realities and changing environment. In this context, the accounting profession has to anticipate, think about the desirable future and not to suffer any more the events. Therefore, it must adopt an entrepreneurial logic. To prepare the firms of tomorrow, innovation is a key factor to consolidate or improve their performance on the long term. This thesis examines the contribution of innovation, conducted as part of a strategic prospective approach to sustainable performance of the liberal accounting profession. Combining qualitative phase (our experience in several accounting firms from 1991 to 2009) and a quantitative phase based on a research questionnaire (146 respondents), the thesis highlights the existence of numerous innovations and their influence on the sustainable performance in French accounting firms."
"This thesis is made of three independent chapters. The first chapter contributes to the literature on expectations. I argue that they may learn a misspecified model instead of learning the rational expectation model. I consider a simple economy with two types of agents. Rational learners learn the true model of the economy whereas consistent learners learn an autoregressive model. I show that a long run equilibrium exists in which consistent learners dominate. Simulations show that the economy may converge towards it. The second chapter deals with the intertemporal choice. I consider a model with wealth in the utility. I study the case of nonseparability. This disentangles between the income effect on labor supply and the intertemporal substitution effect. I derive several implications for economic policy. Then, I estimate the two new parameters introduced in the paper. I find large and positive values for both. The third chapter builds a model of corporate investment under adverse selection. My contribution is to provide a tractable model easy to embed into a macroeconomic model. Borrowers differs by the riskiness of their investment project like in Stiglitz and Weiss (1981). They have infinite horizon and signal their type by borrowing a fraction of their retained earnings. I get an analytic solution for the incentive constraint. I integrate the relation into a dynamic model and derive some implications."
"In Chapter 1 I investigate ﬁrm-level efﬁciency outcomes of mergers between the European energy producers. I compute eco-efﬁciency using data envelopment analysis and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. I ﬁnd that carefully regulated domestic horizontal mergers do not have a statistically signiﬁcant impact. Cross-border horizontal mergers hamper eco-efﬁciency in the short run but stimulate it two years after completion. Vertical mergers are detrimental to eco-efﬁciency. I put forward policy suggestions regarding the regulation of mergers. Chapter 2 is joint work with Julian Hinz. We investigate the effects of self-imposed Russian embargo on food import from Western countries. We build a Ricardian model with sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods and sectoral heterogeneity in production. The calibration of the model with real data allows to simulate the outcomes of embargo in terms of changes in welfare and prices. We further quantify the impact on consumer prices in Russia with the difference-in-differences estimator. Chapter 3 is based on a paper co-written with Cristina Herghelegiu. We investigate the use of International Commercial Terms. They are pre-deﬁned schemes of repartition of costs and risks between buyers and sellers, which serve to mitigate the uncertainty. We rely on a highly detailed dataset on Russian exports over the 2012-2015 period. We ﬁnd that big ﬁrms are more likely to take on responsibilities. Big buyers bear more responsibilities regardless of the seller size, whereas big sellers do so only when their partner is small. Risks and costs are more likely on buyers in transactions of intermediate and capital goods."
This doctoral dissertation investigates the impact of networks effects on international trade and finance. The first chapter estimates the role a trade partners’ centrality plays in the diffusion of knowledge and finds that importing from countries at the core of the network leads to a significant increase in economic growth. The second chapter investigates the role of clusters in the speed of technology adoption and concludes that the diffusion of ideas is fostered among countries belonging to the same cluster. The third chapter emphasizes the role of current partners in choosing a destination for new investments and finds that countries are more likely to invest in a new destination if one of their existing partners have already made some investments in the location. The fourth chapter evaluates the impact of importing risky products on the economy and finds that the elasticity of a country’s exports with respect to its import share of fragile products from a partner impacted by a natural disaster is -0.7 percent.
"Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a decision-making support tool to judge a policy as to its potential effects and its distribution on a population’s health (equity). It’s still very often a qualitative approach.The main aim here is to show the usefulness of applying quantified multivariate statistical methodologies to enrich HIA practice, while making the decision-making process easier, by issuing understandable outputs even for non-statisticians.The future of healthcare reforms shifts the center of evaluation of health systems from providers to people’s individual needs and preferences, reducing health inequities in access and health outcomes, using big data linking information from providers to social and economic health determinants. Innovative statistical and assessment methodologies are needed to make this transformation.Data mining and data science methods, however complex, may lead to graphical outputs simple to understand by decision makers. HIA is thus a valuable tool to assure public policies are indeed evaluated while considering health determinants and equity and bringing citizens to the center of the decision-making process."
"Today, psychosocial risks at work (PSR) are major challenges for organizations, both for the employee’s psychosocial health and for the company’s economic health. But current risk management and occupational health and safety devices are inadequate for this new class of risk. That explains the difficulty organizations have with taking them into account. PSR remains quite invisible for managers because the usual risk assessment focuses on the individual and does not call the organization into question. This doctoral dissertation offers several reflections and management control projects that lead to modelling a tool for managing RPS. This tool integrates their organizational aspects and incorporates the many expectations of organizations and their environments. Based on neo-institutional theories, we propose a new reading of the institutionalization process in an organizational field undergoing structuration. This view is proven to work in light of new health care expectations organizations have and the responses they may deliver. Management tools play multiple yet decisive roles in defining the institutional process. This thesis aims to contribute to the future of RPS management, which might help shape a prevention policy based prior to when the effects on workers’ health appear."
"Soil quality is a major issue for the environment and the preservation of the agronomic and economic potential of farms. Farming practices have substantial impacts on soil quality; some are detrimental and lead to a long-term decrease in productivity. The objective of this thesis is to characterize the mid-term and long-term economic issues related to soil quality changes using theoretical, statistical and empirical tools and to propose a dynamic bioeconomic model that highlights these issues. Using the simulations of different economic scenarios, we seek to identify the levers that make it possible to preserve the agronomic and economic potential of soil.  The model used is a dynamic optimal control model where the rational agent-farmer with perfect information maximizes his profits over time under a soil quality dynamics constraint. We consider two production factors: productive inputs (such as mineral nitrogen fertilizers) and soil quality, captured by the quantity of soil organic mSoil quality is negatively impacted by the productive inputs used by the farmer, who can invest in his soil quality (crop residue use, tillage intensity, crop rotation choice). Our results show that soil quality investment is a component of the farmer's optimal strategy. The farmer substitutes the ecosystemic functionalities of his soil for chemical inputs in response to the increase in fertilizers and energy prices.  However, the mitigated results of our empirical model in terms of SOM final values show the importance of considering a large range of farming practices. Our results offer a ba"
"His thesis aims to provide some answers to the question of what makes a board effective in carrying out its monitoring and advising functions. In Chapter 1, we examine whether board structures that include directors that are related to minority shareholders can be an effective corporate governance mechanism to limit expropriation by controlling shareholders, without exacerbating risk. We focus our empirical analysis of this chapter on banks with a concentrated ownership structure. We find that the inclusion of such minority directors does indeed increase the effectiveness of bank boards, as it results in higher market valuations, without increasing risk. Chapter 2 complements the first chapter to determine the factors, at the bank and at the country level, that could favor the presence of minority directors on bank boards. We find that: (i) the voting rights of controlling shareholders, the quality of recommendations for boards of directors in Corporate Governance Codes and higher shareholder protection are factors that promote the presence of minority directors on bank boards; (ii) the degree of opacity and stronger supervisory regimes reduce the presence of minority directors on bank boards. Our work suggests that bank authorities should recommend banks with concentrated ownership structure to include a minimum of minority directors in their board. In Chapter 3, we investigate the impact of gender quotas on firm performance and corporate decisions using Belgium, France and Italy as a natural experiment. Our statistical analysis shows that the percentage of female directors significantly increases, and board members characteristics significantly change after the implementation of the gender quota. The results of our empirical analysis show evidence that gender quotas do not have a significant impact on both firm outcomes and corporate decisions.  Our findings support the decision of policy-makers to use mandatory rules to force firm to achieve gender balance on corporate boards. Our results suggest that policy-makers create unrealistic expectations for women to boost firm performance, at least in the short-run when negative side effects of mandatory rules are potentially strongest."
"This doctoral research aims to discuss the construction and observation of plural cultural consumption patterns based on the case of comics. The literature review seems to highlight the importance of reporting both the present (synchronic) and temporal (diachronic) dimensions of the cultural practices observed. Lahire's (2005, 2013) dispositionalist and contextualist perspective seems to be a response to this requirement. Indeed, the cultural practices observed are never disconnected from the frameworks that participate in their construction or from those that allow them to be observed in contexts. To reflect this dual dimension of cultural practices, this work is based on the production of six sociological portraits (Lahire, 2005). They allow not only to identify the variety of frameworks behind the construction of observed consumption patterns, but also to describe the variety of their effects at the individual level: the dispositions"
"The professional home-care market for the disabled elderly in France is regulated. The APA partially reimburses the professional home-care demand and the price of some home-care producers are fixed by the regulator. These producers must serve every area on the territory. The departmental councils set up these regulation policies. Their goal is to reduce financial and geographical inequalities in terms of access to home-care inside each department. Our thesis tries to determine if reductions of inequalities inside each department increase inequalities between department. The first chapter uses a departmental survey to check if the decentralization of regulation policies creates a heterogeneity between department. The second chapter aims to estimate the effects of the heterogeneity observed in the previous chapter on the home-care consumption. We use a national survey to estimate the price-elasticity of the professional home-care demand. The third chapter uses firm’s billing data to analyze the distribution function of the public support according to personal income and its impact on consumption. Finally, the fourth chapter presents a theoretical model of a mixed market where two firms compete on a market, one of which has a ubiquity constraint. The model studies the effect of this ubiquity constraint on the quality."
"This thesis starts, theoretically, with the informativeness of signals when information is imperfect, followed by the applications on the credit and tabor markets. In chapter 2 we show that Blackwell's informativeness criterion can imply the dispersion of the conditional expectations - the supermodular dispersion criterion proposed by Ganuza and Penalva (2010), only when the signal is binary. Links between the dispersion of the conditional expectations and Persico's accuracy criterion can be built up but with strong restrictions. In chapter 3, we consider a lender-borrower relationship where borrowers can choose to disclose their private information by paying a non-negligible cost. The decision of information revelation is endogenized, and so is the market opacity. We show that there exists only opaque (transparent) equilibrium when the safe interest rate is low (high) enough; there are multiple equilibrium when interest rate is intermediate and credit crunch may happen. The model is then extended to an OLG context and we show that the market may converge either to an opaque or a transparent stationary state, or, for some configurations of parameters, have permanent oscillations between different states. In chapter 4 we study the impact of hiring discrimination on workers' skill investment decision in a directed search model. Both the discriminated and favored group can underinvest in skills in equilibrium. Whenever one group underinvest, the other remain high skilled and firms suffer from lower profit compared to the economy where discrimination is absent."
"In the context of ever stiffer competition, ever better informed customers, and products becoming ever more undistinguishable, it is increasingly difficult for companies to sell their products and services and maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. Hence the need for them to have access to a proper perception of the evolutions, movements and practices of the main actors in their environment. Tools such as economic intelligence and market intelligence make it possible to respond to the aforementioned challenges. Among the actors likely to take on an important role in this field is the sales force, as an interface between the market and the company. Although salespeople are increasingly considered as veritable vectors of information in the field, the study of the factors that determine their performance in that sense has received little attention until now. In this context, the objective of this thesis is to propose a model analyzing the main factors likely to influence the performance of sales people in terms of market intelligence. The basic hypothesis of this model relies on the existence of two main categories of factors likely to favor the performance of sales people in terms of passing on field information on a regular basis (market intelligence): first, factors which are specific to salespeople, and second, factors linked to the management of the sales force."
"The development of participatory democracy, a wave of decentralization in all Europe...: over the last decades, the legitimization of a plurality of actors, besides the Central State, has been a cornerstone of public action. The increasing use of the notion of « Governance » to describe public action is one the main illustrations of this evolution, but the role of the Central State and its administration in this new context remains hardly known, at a time when public administration, its action and its organization, are precisely in a process of being re-­‐defined, empirically as much as theoretically. Our thesis ambitions to explore the following question: what does « administrating » involve in a context of governance? Drawing on the case of the emergence and implementation of a new activity in the French public administration (the Environmental Authority), we highlight the state of uncertainty and tension generated by the development of this new activity, which is rooted in the traditional administrative organization but needs to contribute to a new form of public action, conceived with a governance logic, in other words based on a multiplicity of actors with various influences and interactions in different configurations. We then analyze how a heterogeneous and variable public action is developed empirically through public officers’ daily work. It is argued that this is both a difficulty and a resource for public action. Drawing on the organizational routine dynamics framework, this heterogeneity and variability of public action is theorized. Then, based on the proposition of different management dispositif, we show that « administrating » in a context of governance can be conceived as the capacity to both develop and regulate heterogeneity and variability in administrative action."
"The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the improvement of the valuation of corporate bonds, particularly by drawing some lessons from the recent economic and financial crisis. In order to achieve this goal, we propose an approach based on corporate bonds' credit spreads. We start, in the first chapter, by analyzing the main existing valuation models, which we reformulate from the standpoint of credit spreads and which we simulate numerically. We show that, despite the attractive features that the structural models have, the latter exert contain several shortcomings which may be misleading especially in a crisis context. In the second and third chapters, we focus on the empirical credit spreads, which we analyze during the subprime crisis and the Eurozone crisis periods. By the means of : (i) a descriptive analysis, (ii) principal component analyses, and(iii) statistical regression analyses, we manage to shed light on a number of factors which affect the movements of the spreads and have not been addressed by the existing models. Among these factors, we show that : (i) the wave of bailouts that occurred during the crisis has had an important effect on the spreads, and (ii) the size of a firm is connected with its spreads. Based on these empirical results, we propose in the fourth chapter a contribution to the modeling of corporate bonds which accounts for the possibility of firms to negotiate a rescue plan in case of distress. This model allows us, on the one hand, to reproduce the empirical observations of lower credit spreads for higher probabilities of receiving a bailout (as it is the case for large banks), and on the other hand, to tackle several drawbacks of the existing models, such as the simple bankruptcy mechanisms or the low credit spreads for short maturities."
"Stakeholders require companies to include in their management process social responsibility criteria such as health and safety and the fight against discrimination etc. Standards of CSR or sustainable development (ISO 26000, 14001, OHSAS 18001, 1000 AA ...) are many and reflect the issues and difficulties in its operationalization. NGO‟s criticisms reveal, among other things, the lack of commitment of employees who are at the very heart of the company's shares. This work is part of doctoral research determining causes of socially responsible behavior of employees. We discuss our research in terms of the Employment Relationship-Organization-and inscribe our work in the concept of psychological contracts in organizations (Rousseau, 1995). Our research aims to better understand a social phenomenon whose research is currently under- detailed and underutilized. We chose a company in the temporary work sector and focused our research on behavior in HRM. Our research is qualitative, ethnographic and explanatory; we show that shared beliefs, behavioral norms and broader tangible or intangible resources shape the socially responsible behavior of employees. To our knowledge no research has been based on our methodology to meet this specific managerial problem."
"Today environmental issues are at the heart of development debates. At the origin of the introduction of the sustainable development concept in the Brundtland Report in 1987, there has been the need of taking other dimensions of development into account rather than the economic dimension in order to minimize the impact of the human activity on resources.The development experiences of certain territories have been at the center of the territorial development approach, particularly the French territories which constitute important cases for the basket of goods and services approach of the Grenoble model developed by Bernard Pecqueur and Amédée Mollard. Moreover, ecosystem services began to have an important place as a framework of land planning and territorial development since the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005. From a territorial approach perspective, ecosystem services (ES) can allow can allow one to take into account environmental issues and enrich development perspectives based on different dimensions of sustainability.The aim of this PhD research is to develop a research framework based on ecosystem services for a sustainable territorial development. Thus, by proposing a new concept, the notion of ES basket, we hypothesize that the basket of ecosystem services framework can facilitate the inventory of physical, ecological and cultural resources derived from the ecosystems of a territory and encourage the actors of the territory to adopt sustainable practices in the valorization process of resources, creating a collective identity around the services. To confirm this hypothesis, we first define the notion of SE basket and then show the relevance of developing a non-monetary methodological framework based on multicriteria indicators and perceptions. This methodological framework has been applied to a case study in Turkey, the territory of the Karaburun Peninsula, located in the Aegean Region about a hundred kilometers from Izmir. This case study made it possible to identify the prospects for territorial development and the policy of support for the sustainable valorization of Karaburun ES baskets. It also allowed identifying some methodological, financial and institutional limitations that must be taken into account in future work to improve the research framework."
"In the Latin American context, shaped by rapid urbanization, high inequalities and the weakness of labor institutions, issues related to the structure of the labor market and the effect of relational intermediation on job performance appear fundamental. This thesis aims to describe the structure of employment and analyzes the effects of social networks on the quality of employment and the performance of workers in Bogota’s labor market (Colombia). This work adopts a multidisciplinary research approach based on a socioeconomic and institutionalist framework. In the first part, a theoretical and analytical reflection is conducted through the notion of quality of employment, to overcome the classical typologies commonly used in developing countries. From this perspective, quality of employment can be seen as a new performance indicator grasped through the prism of the labor market segmentation theory, making possible to consider the rationales and the differential effects produced by the use of social networks. Subsequently, based on quantitative data from the household survey (geih, 2013) supplemented by information collected through focus groups, the multidimensional, econometric and comprehensive exploratory analysis allows to empirically verify that : (i.) quality of employment reflects a strongly polarized structure of the labor market in Bogota, (ii.) the use of social networks is associated differently with the quality of employment of workers according to their segment ; opposing necessity networks (for the vulnerable segment) and opportunity networks (for the protected segment). Based on the theories of the embeddedness and the sociology of networks, the second part of this thesis proposes to explore the dimensions, configurations and mechanisms of different types of social networks to get a job. Using original data on egocentric networks collected from a specific mixed survey system deployed in Bogota between 2016 and 2018, the empirical results from multidimensional and econometric analyzes and, the application of quantified narratives method demonstrate that : (i.) the combination of an extended potential network and a cohesive active network increases the search time but also the probability of finding a satisfactory job, (ii.) the strength of ties appears contextualized and negatively correlated with income but positively with its evolution between the last and the current job, (iii.) during the actors’ labor market trajectories, the necessary resources for changing job and the relationships to access them are clearly differentiated by the type of evolution (incremental or radical)."
"Context: IP Leanware is a growing start-up. Created in 2008, its consolidated sales has quadrupled in 4 years and established two subsidiaries (Brazil and the United States). Since then, its growth has been two digits (2015). It optimizes the performance of industrial companies with software (BrainCube) that identifies overperformance conditions. The thesis, carried out in CIFRE within the R&D service led by Sylvain Rubat du Mérac, is located at the interface of management control, production management and information systems.Aim: BrainCube manages massive descriptive data of its customers' process flows. Its analysis engine identifies overperformance situations and broadcasts them in real time through tactile interfaces. BrainCube couples two flows: informational and physical. The mission is to integrate the economic variable. A literature study shows that simultaneous real-time evaluation of physical, informational and financial flows coupled with continuous improvement of production processes is not realized.Result: A literature review examines the practices and methods of management control to propose a real-time method adapted to the specificities of BrainCube. The case study, based on an engineering-research, proposes a generic modeling methodology of the economic variable. Configurable generic decision models are proposed. They must facilitate the use of real time information with high granularity. The contributions, limits and perspectives highlight the interest of works for the company and the management sciences."
"This research aims to contribute to the study of the management of the accounting data and to its derivative using the IFRS standards. Two research questions are emerging: is the change of accounting standards a source of more accounting manipulation and what are the ways to highlight the accounting manipulation of accounts established in IFRS standards? Our introductory chapter sets out the context of the creation and the implementation of IFRS. Chapter 1 highlights their impact on the consolidated accounts of listed French companies’ management indicators. Chapter 2 studies the behavior of the accruals closed the accounting thresholds, and the possible accounting manipulation of results. Chapter 3 is a comprehensive study of the accruals discretionary to manipulate accounting data."
"This dissertation is comprised of three chapters on the interaction between migrants and their source regions applied to China and Vietnam. The first chapter examines whether remittances are related to receivers’ trust and trustworthiness in Vietnam. Using a combination of a field experiment conducted in 2010 and the “2002 Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey”, the chapter finds that while internal remittances have no significant relationship to trusting behavior, international remittances demonstrate a significantly positive connection. On the other hand, international remittances are negatively related to trustworthiness, while internal remittances are positively associated. Besides, this study finds that the level of trustworthiness is higher in the south than in the north. The second chapter explores the role of children by age and by gender as a motive for return migration in China by using a rural household survey conducted in Wuwei County (Anhui province) in 2008. Resorting to a discrete time proportional hazard model and a binary Probit model to estimate respectively the determinants of migration duration for both on-going migrants and return migrants, and the return intentions of on-going migrants, the chapter finds consistent results regarding the role of left-behind children as a significant motive for return. The last chapter examines the impact of the migration experience on individuals’ choice of being self-employed upon their return to their home villages. By using the same data of Wuwei survey, the chapter finds that return migrants are more likely to be self-employed than non-migrants, and that both return savings and the frequency of job changes during migration increase the likelihood for return migrants to become self-employed."
"We tackle the issue of including individual vaccination decisions in epidemiological models. We draw on the example of Measles vaccination, and we focus on strategic interactions and anticipatory behavior. We contribute to a fuller account of such behaviors by developing a modeling approach intended as a tool for practitioners and theorists.In Chapter 1, we show how the interplay between individual anticipatory vaccination decisions and the otherwise biological dynamics of a disease may lead to the emergence of recurrent patterns.  We consider a Measles-like outbreak, rational and far-sighted individuals, vital dynamics, and waning vaccine efficacy. This chapter illustrates the versatility of our approach. For comparison, we provide results for individuals with adaptive behavior.In Chapter 2, we investigate the effect of anticipatory behavior in a scenario where Measles vaccination becomes mandatory. When mandatory vaccination is announced in advance, we show that individuals may alter their vaccination behavior, thus causing an increase in prevalence before Measles is ultimately eradicated.  These transition effects lead to non negligible welfare differences between generations. We consider an anti-vaccinationist subpopulation with a higher vaccination cost, and exhibit scenarios where anti-vaccinationists are among those who benefit the most from mandatory vaccination.In Chapter 3, we discuss whether coalitions of vaccinating individuals can account for the relatively high vaccination coverages observed in developed countries. We explain why and how retaliation concepts usually found in repeated games can be used in the context of vaccination, even though individuals vaccinate only once. This allows us to model how vaccinating individuals might retaliate against those who refuse vaccination.  We show that retaliation threats can sustain vaccination where it would otherwise be suboptimal for individuals."
"In my dissertation I look at mental representations and cognitive processes that underlie mental arithmetic in the marketplace. This research contributes to behavioral pricing literature by outlining novel factors that influence consumers’ price difference judgments. Particularly, I uncover factors that make consumers more or less likely to fall prey to the left-digit anchoring bias (Essay 1) and factors that determine their tendency to rely on relative thinking in price difference evaluations (Essay 3). Further, this research provides new insights to the mental budgeting literature by identifying mental computation strategies that lead to more accurate basket price estimates (Essay 2). Overall, I expect my research to contribute to our understanding of consumers’ price judgments and suggest contexts and strategies leading to more accurate price evaluations."
"The purpose of this study is to understand how a social entity becomes a stakeholder. The various methods of determining the stakeholders are criticized on their heuristic value. One of these problems is their inability to say ""who"" is a stakeholder and ""who"" is not. In other words, the stakeholder theory lacks a criterion of falsifiability. Therefore, understanding the process by which an entity becomes a stakeholder means that this entity is not a priori a stakeholder. Consequently, studying the process by which a group of individuals becomes a stakeholder of a company returns to state a criterion of falsification. This is the general problem of this research.To understand this process, it is said that any group cannot be considered at beginning as a stakeholder but it can become a stakeholder. The empirical phase is based on a multiple- case study. Three companies are studied. The study reveals three main results. First, the firm is seen as a four-relationship node. Second, all parties cannot be consider as stakeholders. Finally, according to the link through which an individual or group of individuals is related to the organization, it assumes a special role. These links are: the partnership relationship, the legal-political relationship, the commercial relationship and the societal relationship. Persons related to the company by a partnership relationship are partners. Individuals related to the company by the commercial relationship are clients. The legal and political relationship puts a person in connection with the company through legal or political institutions. Individuals related to the company by the societal relationship are stakeholders.The process by which a group of individuals can become stakeholders begins with the occurrence of an element in issue (decision, organizational behavior). The process is random, unpredictable, and temporary because any decision of a company do not cause mobilizations."
"The aim of our research is to improve the understanding that we have towards the Shared Service Centers (SSC), a way of organization which has been the trend in the last years. To be more specific, the aim of our work is to explore the existing singularity between this specific organizational method, which is the SSC applied to the Information System (IS) and the strategic alignment with the enterprise. The objective of this paper is therefore to test the impact of the IS alignment in a company which uses the SSC. We have considered to study our question under the aspect of the variation of the IS alignment and the stakeholder’s “satisfaction”. We focalized on the postoperative handover (alignment of usages). This approach includes the “dynamic” and “usage” terms and takes into account the temporary and relational dimensions. Our work is inserted in a new research field that provides them with an explorative characteristic. We have built our strategy and our research study in a progressive way. Beforehand, it has seemed to us crucial to undergo a theoretic exploration of the subjects related to our research, in order to build simultaneously the basis and the purpose of the mentioned approach. The knowledge we have acquired has led us to elaborate conceptual proposals (6 hypotheses) from a constructivist perspective. These proposals were built during initial exploration tests and afterwards they were tested in European companies using one or more SSC. It seemed to us more logical to adopt the complementarity of a dual qualitative approach. On one hand, we studied in detail one company and, on the other hand, we have realized a poly organizational study, composed by 5 case studies, which were based on 9 semi-directive interviews.The variety of the results obtained tends to demonstrate the singularity of our research. Two proposals must be highlighted. The first one is that the strategic alignment in the long term is reinforced by the use of a SSC (hypothesis 1) and the second one is linked to the fact that the external stakeholders can be easily managed by the clients’ enterprises which use a SSC (hypothesis 3). More generally, we have verified two other interesting contributions during our research. The first one is linked to a larger stability in the case of deep changes as, for example, a merger or a takeover (hypothesis 2 and 6). Our academic research has reached the conclusion that the SSC is a factor which offers stability to the company that uses it. The second contribution is fundamental, that is, it covers the importance of the interfaces between the SSC and the other internal parties involved. The connections between the different groups are essential in order to obtain and to maintain a good alignment."
"This thesis aims at understanding labor market dynamics. In order to shed light on the mechanisms at the origin of labor market stocks, e.g. the unemployment rate, this thesis studies flows of workers. Indeed, changes in stocks hide a perpetual movement of worker flows between labor market states. When some individuals are finding a job, some others are losing their, while others are withdrawing from participation. To take into account all these alternatives, this thesis proposes applied studies, based on survey data, but also theoretical analyses, based on modern macroeconomic models. The four essays of this thesis suggest that non-participation and return to job are dominant in explaining French unemployment variations. It is also shown that, in terms of worker flows, paths are multiples and depend on individual own characteristics: “unskilled” workers accumulate difficulties on the labor market; women have lower chances of participating when their family size increases. At a macroeconomic level, this thesis shows that worker flows responses to aggregate shocks differ according to their origin. Moreover, the economic environment has a direct impact on worker flows. Times of uncertainty, characterized by a high level of unpredictability, change the behavior of economic agents. As search activities have a lower probability to be successful, fewer individuals move from non-participation to participation."
"Human activities and the environment interact through multiple and complex relations. Can the natural environment be viewed as a limit to growth ? This thesis tries to develop answers to this crucial question.The first chapter shows that environmental degradations may constitute a brake on growth diminishing life expectancy, and thus savings. It also shows that environmental poverty traps may exist. However,public environmental policies may help countries to escape from such traps, and to reach a higher level of income per capita. In the second chapter, we suggest that the existence of polluting non-renewable resources necessary for production may hamper growth. However, we show that flow pollutions caused by the use of resources can’t be seen as a development brake. Then, following neoclassical works of the1970s, we confirm that exogenous technological progress and sufficient substitution possibilities mayal low to overcome difficulties linked to the exhaustibility of resources. Finally, the third chapter demonstrates that, in low-income economies, strong resource dependency dampens growth while abundanceis growth promoting. Dependence is the outcome of economic choices. Thus a diversification policy that consists on investing the rent in secondary and tertiary sectors may help reduce dependence. Finally, we suggest that the development of education, institutions, and financial markets may allow to decrease the probability to experience a resource curse."
"This thesis studies challenges for modern developped economies, including the structural change toward services, population ageing, weak labor mobility in the EMU and unconventional monetary policies after the 2008 financial crisis. The manuscript is divided into four chapters.In the first chapter, we analyze the interaction between interbank markets and default risk using a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model, with a focus on the transmission of the recent financial crisis and unconventional monetary policies.In the second chapter, we investigate the effects of fiscal devaluations on key macroeconomic aggregates and welfare using a two-country monetary-union model with endogenous varieties and endogenous tradability.In the third chapter, we study the impact of demographic factor and the growth of service sector by using a multi-sectoral OLG model, and effectuate counterfactual experiments in which the annual growth rate of young generation is ±1pp than the actual growth rate.In the fourth chapter, we study the potential interactions between financial integration and labor mobility in a currency union facing asymmetric shocks, and simulate the impacts of 2008 financial crisis under different mobility costs."
"Since the 1990s, the New Public Management has transformed the public hospital, we talk about a turning management. The emergence of medical activity centers in 2005, consists of a new hospital governance. We sought to understand how the poles of medical activity are changing decision-making processes? We have chosen to mobilize the concept of structural configuration (Mintzberg, 1982) and the theory of organized anarchy (Cohen, March and Olsen, 1972). The question now is whether the change in structural configuration will increase or reduce organized anarchy? To answer this question, we conducted two data collection phases in a CHU: the analysis of the daily management of three clusters and two cluster projects. Our case study revealed that the hospital has not become a divisionalized structure but is in transition, in a hybrid structural configuration. The poles tended to increase organized anarchy and organizational slack for the time being. Notably because of the influence of the economic context, the absence of pole contracts, the problem of training agents and a constant opposition between managers and medical staff. The poles are new units that have made the internal organization more complex. However, the arrival of the clusters has been accompanied by a redistribution of roles, new management tools and new management processes. Thus, the change in structural configuration has impacted the hospital's decision-making process by changing the practices and frameworks of these decision-making processes."
"Welfare economics in a behavioral world is gaining increasing traction for research in economics and social sciences at large. Especially the last three decades, ever more research eﬀorts have been directed to understand welfare better. Social capital has been one of the prime candidates and now a domain of research. Research is undertaken to understand its importance, how it operates, and what impact it has on the well-being of an individual and the health of a society. The capabilities approach developed by Amartya Sen highlights the fundamental role of economic development that focuses on the improving individual capabilities and expanding choice sets of each individual. However, this capability approach is individual-centric and inadvertently leaves out the shared or the collective nature of an individual’s existence. The social networks/interconnectedness is not addressed in the capability approach of Sen. At the same time, the social networks embody the mobilization of individuals in groups, association, and civic action. This aspect is developed by Giraud et al. (2013), called the relational capability approach. Another major research domain that cannot be neglected in the economic or human development evaluation is happiness (or subjective well-being). The concept of subject well-being is closely related to the social capital domain. In the literature, these concepts of social capital, relational capabilities, subjective well-being and development, and especially the linkages between them are not well explored or explicitly studied. This is the primary motivation for this dissertation."
"The use of discretion in public procurement may take place at different stages of the procurement process. The economic literature has widely investigated the benefits and limitations of its use. This dissertation focuses on two dimensions of discretion. First, a public authority has to decide whether to provide a public service in-house or privately. This dissertation empirically investigates the determinants of both remunicipalizations and privatizations for the water distribution services. This decision to switch appears to be mainly driven by economic efficiency reasons. Also, a tendency to switch from one regime to another one in neighboring municipalities influences this decision. Second, this dissertation focuses on public buyer's discretionary power towards the award mechanism. The economic literature acknowledges that even though discretion may yield a better value for money when awarding a contract, it may also facilitate corruption. This dissertation analyzes the impact of investigation for corruption over the degree of buyer's discretion used. As a matter of fact, a municipality investigated for corruption does not react by using less award procedures that allow for discretionary power. Only neighbors of municipalities that are eventually found guilty react, suggesting that responsive neighbors to investigation might also be involved in the case under investigation. Finally, the question of the effect of discretionary power over the likelihood to select a productive supplier is addressed. It follows that an award procedure that allows for discretionary power leads to the selection of less productive firms than an award procedure that does not."
"In this dissertation, I contribute to the literature on international economics by drawing attention to the impact of trade flows and structural reforms on productivity growth in the manufacturing sector in Europe and India. ln the first chapter co-authored, with Antoine Berthou, Jong-Chung Chung and Kalina Manova, we demonstrate that growth in exports and imports boosts labor productivity, but only export demand reallocates activity toward more productive firms in presence of price distortions. Moreover, market and institutional frictions dampen the ability of economies to react and gain from trade shocks. ln the second chapter, I show that the increase in Chinese imports of intermediate inputs is a significant driver of aggregate TFP growth in France as it increases efficiency in sharing market shares between firms. Allowing more firms to access intermediate goods at the best price-quality ratio stimulates aggregate productivity growth. ln the third chapter, co-written with Adil Mohommad and Piyapom Sodsriwiboon, our finding suggests that removing structural rigidities in the labor market and improving credit allocation would reduce distortions and contribute to productivity gains and long term growth in India."
"Nowadays one of peculiarities of the liberalized airline market is a huge divergence of ticket prices for the same flights. Mostly it reflects the companies' being unable to easily change the volumes of production or/and store them. The development and use of the yield management models (seat allocation models) have centered on airlines offering a variety of different types of fares for travel on the same flight. The goal of this dissertation is to construct a number of economic models to explain the price dispersion on the airline market from the different points of view. In Part 3, I create a direct price mode! which explains how different product and consumer characteristics influence the price level. It is shown how different attributes like the moment of ticket reservation, ticket class, weekday of the departure and number of coupons define the price and how it corresponds to the consumer characteristics (gender, income, age, etc.). Part 4 is devoted to the differences of the price level from the competition point of view. In a strategic game where firms compete against each other the set of rationalizable strategies for each player entails ail the best responses to the others' decisions. This chapter proposes an empirical test of the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in a Cournot oligopoly. In Part 5 I treat an airline passenger market as a market with the product differentiation and apply a multinomial logit model to calculate price elasticities. The logit model (with a special focus on the consumers heterogeneity) estimates how the different product characteristics influence the market shares."
"This thesis studies team coordination and polycentricity by proposing a practical approach to an institutional analysis of coordination. Indeed, the definition of coordination is not easy even if the term is used daily in different areas and especially that of health. Coordination would apply today to actions, actors or elements of an activity. Malone and Crowston (1994) note that coordination is so much present in our daily lives that we only perceive it mainly when it is failing. To refine the understanding of the coordination, studied using organization theory or organizational behavior theory, recent contributions have recognized an analysis of the microsocial, continuous and situated nature of coordination. They examine the coordination practices developed by the actors in the field (e.g. Faraj, Xiao 2006 ; Bechky, 2006; Kellogg and al., 2006; Jarzabkowski, and al., 2012; Harrison and Rouse, 2014; Schakel and al., 2016; BenMenahem and al., 2016; Wolbers and al., 2017 ; Bouty and Drucker-Godard, 2018). The analysis of coordination would thus be part of the examination of the recursive effects between concrete practices of coordination and institutional influences. However, it is clear that the literature struggles to demonstrate these reciprocal influences. The institutional environment is complex, many decision centers can be identified and are interdependent (Ostrom et al, 1961). In order to investigate these environments, Ostrom (2005) propose a polycentric conception of institutional diversity which enables us to understand how we can link the organization of the means to achieve a collective action, coordinated at institutional level as diverse as it can be, and the practices of the actors within action arenas. This thesis shows that the practical approach of the analysis and institutional development framework (ADI) proposed by Ostrom makes possible the combination of the different coordination analyzes carried out so far in the management literature within the same model. Using a comprehensive qualitative research on the coordination of pre-hospital emergency teams, we propose a coordination analysis framework integrating the different approaches to coordination developed in management sciences. We detail a central element of Ostrom's IAD framework: the action arena which is the place of coordination practices. Taking into account institutional diversity in action, leads us to rethink the team in meta-collective. It is a specific training made of interrelationships between multiple participants of intricate action arenas. The concept of polycentricity in management also allows us to design systems where a relationship to a resource is the basis of a system of vigilant and responsible interrelationships. This thesis also demonstrates the importance of dealing with institutional diversity, to deal with all possible situations in complex contexts, such as pre-hospital emergency relief. We propose to leave the logic of unification as the only possibility of efficiency as the multi-institutional systems are flexible, resilient and safe, especially thanks to the formalized or informal feedback that must be encouraged. However, in these polycentric contexts a robust and adaptable rule system must be preserved. The system can adapt itself by regularly changing the provisions for action. Attention must then be turned to the transition from ""rules in use"" to the stage of ""institutionalized rules"" to ensure the reliability of the system."
"The recent global financial crises that have almost jeopardized the world economy and shaken the global economic and financial systems have forced political authorities and institutions to strengthen their current laws and regulations to help safeguard against any future crises. In this context, risk control, transparency and visibility of information have become the foundations which standards seek to put in order to keep future crises at a distance. This thesis aims to describe the impact of the multiplicity of norms in the banking sector which can result in constraints, contradictions and significant costs for the bank. The purpose of this work is to present the mechanisms put in place by the banking establishment to meet the current regulatory requirements as well as analyze the consequences, coherences and stakes of the standards on risk management and on the internal organization of the establishment. The results underline the interest of the integral management of norms in the financial sector. The research results show that the performance of a retail bank will depend directly on its ability to anticipate and manage the various sets of standards it faces. The management of the ""standard"" is now becoming a major topic in the banking sector as well as risk management. Both are intrinsically linked.The foundation of this work is based on a four-year longitudinal case study built from action research at a retail bank. This approach is based on semi-structured interviews, content analysis of internal documents, meetings ... The study has mobilized control and risk theory as well as “tetranormalization” theory in order to analyze the management of norms in banking institutions."
"Based on the primary financing theories and considering the context of financing decisions, this study serves two purposes. On the one hand, understanding the determinants of the Moroccan corporations financial structure, and on the other hand, evaluating the impact of these corporations financing decisions on their stock exchange prices. As a first step, we verified through an econometric study, the ability of traditional determinants of debt to explain the financial structure of Moroccan corporations during regular times and during financial crisis times. As a second step, we tested the theory of conventions which states the existence of financing modes. To that end, we carried out an analysis of the main components and a top-down classification. On last time, we carried out an events study in order to evaluate the stock market response to financing decisions. Our study targeted a series of 50 non-financial corporations listed in the Casablanca stock exchange and on 16 capital increase and bond financing announcements. Results show that only a few variables, originally from the financial theory, play a primary role in the financing policy of Moroccan corporations. Thus, considering the size and financial crisis effects, the influence of these variables changes from a compartment to another, and also from a period to another. Furthermore, the final results show that the financial structure stands as a financing mode which is influenced by the financial needs nature. Thus, in regular times Autonomy is the regime that adheres to most firms in the sample. In contrast, overdraft regime is best represented in recession. The events study results suggest that the Moroccan stock market is not responding neither to capital increase announcements nor to bond announcements, and indicate that communicated information by the financing decisions are not valuable to Moroccan investors."
"To encourage actions in favour of renewable energies, in 2011, the Algerian government launched ""program to develop renewable energies and promote energy efficiency”, which described it as ambitious. To decode the stakes of this energetic public policy, especially in terms of polity, we have mobilized the “public governance” approach as well as “stakeholdertheory”. The reception of this “policy” in terms of projects is reflected in two dimensions. The first dimension led us to construct a typology of the projects deployed. The second dimension allowed us to construct a typology of the influence strategies implemented when this public policy was appropriated in large and small projects. They would have to be characterized with the assumption that they would be of a very different nature between the two types of projects observed. We found that large companies, at the local level, use rather similarly limited strategies. On the other hand, small local companies combine several influencing strategies that demonstrate a form of strategic creativity."
"This thesis contains six articles gathered in four chapters. The three first chapters each consist of a theoretical article while the fourth chapter is composed of three empirical articles. The first chapter addresses a framework where a trader wants to buy white another trader wants to sell, these two traders standing in parallel. It seems plausible, yet it requires further examination on aggregate measures of fundamentals, to estimate the risks faced by overconfident agents. The second chapter is devoted to the analysis of credit rationing and illustrates a situation requiring decision-making measured by some fixed scale in investment. In the third chapter, the model shows a sorting condition in the theory of incentives, the principal having the dilemma that he cannot maintain risk preference according to the comparative statics of investment. In the fourth chapter, three empirical articles are presented : the first relates to systematic liquidity in the investment, the second the regulation of small banks and the third analyzes economic size and the viability of the debt while providing an articulation with the capital inequality emphasized by Piketty."
"Workplace corruption is a global issue for private and public organizations. It has beenrecognized as a costly phenomenon having negative consequences in various aspects ofeconomic and human development. Since corrupt acts and behaviors of individuals atworkplace are a challenging subject for managers, this doctoral dissertation seeks to exploreorganizational corruption and also to emphasize the importance of organizational corruptionstudy from a managerial perspective. This study provides elements to better understand howto prevent and to control corrupt acts and behaviors at work. The research model isconstructed on the basis of conservation of resources (COR) theory of Hobfoll (1989).Corruption motivation is theorized through COR theory and within this framework, itproposes corruption as a strategy to prevent the perceived loss of valued motivationalresources. Specially, this research investigates the direct impact of powerlessness, sense ofmastery, distributive and procedural justice on workplace corruption. Furthermore, it studiesthe moderating effect of transparency and caring climate on the relationship betweenpowerlessness, sense of mastery, procedural justice, distributive justice, and workplacecorruption. Sample consists of 575 employees from international organizations havecontributed to this research. Results highlight that powerlessness positively, sense of masteryand procedural justice negatively impact on workplace corruption and deviance. However,distributive justice only negatively impacts on workplace corruption. Results mostly validateour principal hypotheses but suggest that the nature of corruption relates to the type ofresources felt threatened."
"In the world of organizations, banks are characterized by three particular elements: the preeminence of calculations in defining the course of action of the organization; building control and evaluation devices for customers, who, in accounting terms, are their assets; the key role they play in the dissemination of economic rationality in society. Therefore, all banks are based on calculations, and also on paradigms from political economy and its implicit moral imperatives. However, relations between these constitutive dimensions of the banking practices have been little explored by research in accounting. The aim of this work is to contribute to a better knowledge of banking practices and its role in the construction of individuals governed by economic reason. To this end, this work was conducted with close reference to the social and technical history of a particular banking organization, Costa Rica’s Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal (BPDC). The case study has three levels. First, the “governmental discourse” level, which we studied through systematic analysis of the original files and amendments of the organic law of BPDC. In this analysis we identified five political rationales that have historically disputed hegemony in the definition of the conception of control of the organization. Secondly, we studied the level of strategic decision, emphasizing the conflicts linked to the management of assets and liabilities. In this part we put in evidence the relationship between calculative technologies and political rationales identified in the previous level and we show the ways in which the evidence of justification was displaced to reach agreements and make decisions. Finally, the third level of the study has to do with the interaction between the borrowers and the organization. To address it, we reconstructed the history of the devices used to evaluate the borrowers. Thus, we show the relationship between ways of resolving conflicts at the strategic level of the organization and ways to assess credit risk. This work is related to current research trends that study relationships between political economy and management tools. Its aim is to discuss with governmentality studies in accounting. Its main contribution is the construction of a different approach to understand the way in which economic rationality is diffused into the functioning of organizations."
"The massive increase in the availability of data generated everyday by individuals on the Internet has made it possible to address the predictability of financial markets from a different perspective. Without making the claim of offering a definitive answer to a debate that has persisted for forty years between partisans of the efficient market hypothesis and behavioral finance academics, this dissertation aims to improve our understanding of the price formation process in financial markets through the use of Big Data analytics. More precisely, it analyzes: (1) how to measure intraday investor sentiment and determine the relation between investor sentiment and aggregate market returns, (2) how to measure investor attention to news in real time, and identify the relation between investor attention and the price dynamics of large capitalization stocks, and (3) how to detect suspicious behaviors that could undermine the in-formational role of financial markets, and determine the relation between the level of posting activity on social media and small-capitalization stock returns. The first essay proposes a methodology to construct a novel indicator of investor sentiment by analyzing an extensive dataset of user-generated content published on the social media platform Stock-Twits. Examining users’ self-reported trading characteristics, the essay provides empirical evidence of sentiment-driven noise trading at the intraday level, consistent with behavioral ﬁnance theories. The second essay proposes a methodology to measure investor attention to news in real-time by combining data from traditional newswires with the content published by experts on the social media platform Twitter. The essay demonstrates that news that garners high attention leads to large and persistent change in trading activity, volatility, and price jumps. It also demonstrates that the pre-announcement eﬀect is reduced when corrected newswire timestamps are considered. The third essay provides new insights into the empirical literature on small capitalization stocks market manipulation by examining a novel dataset of messages published on the social media plat-form Twitter. The essay proposes a novel methodology to identify suspicious behaviors by analyzing interactions between users and provide empirical evidence of suspicious stock recommendations on social media that could be related to market manipulation. The conclusion of the essay should rein-force regulators’ eﬀorts to better control social media and highlights the need for a better education of individual investors."
"Revolution, which embodies major turns in the course of history, has for a long time been a social study subject. With the coming of the school of public choice in the 1960's, a new economic current helped to undestand revolution. Many economists such as: James M. Buchanan (1962), Gordon Tullock (1971-1974) and John E. Romer (1985) have applied economic theory to social and political science using tools developed by microeconomy. The goal of my research paper is to highlight the contribution of economic theory in the understanding of revolution. I have first drawn a line between two approaches that have studied revolution: The sociological approach which mainly explains why do people revolt when they are faced with structural imbalances. The economic approach which uses the theory of rational choice to demonstrate how people choose to be passive when they are confronted with a revolution."
"Fundamental efficiency, i.e. efficiency understood as the fact financial asset prices reflect their intrinsic value is as such rarely tested. Our research aims at a renewal of its test modes based on a constructivist conception of intrinsic value. This renewal, centered on an investee’s point of view, is implemented on 4 cases of French listed firms on a 3-year period. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the identification of the most recognized actors of this kind of public expression. It shows these are the sell-side financial analysts. The second part studies the relationship between the public appraisal of intrinsic value by these actors and stock price changes. It establishes this appraisal heavily depends on market dynamics. The third part tries to explain this by displaying as a figuration the interdependence mode in which analysts, investors and other actors are all involved."
"This PhD thesis focuses on the implementation of an ERP in a group of small subsidiaries through a multi-cycle canonical action research conducted by the researcher, ERP project manager for two years. Subsidiaries face multiple challenges : deploying a standard ERP while preserving their flexibility, reconciling the group constraints and local constraints, making do with means at hand given the limited resources. This context is an opportunity to deepen the theory of bricolage, little mobilized in the ERP literature. The results show multilevel collective bricolage processes: intra-affiliates, inter-affiliates and group. These bricolage processes allow continuous improvement of the ERP and its appropriation, and ultimately lead to the design and use of solutions that are difficult to imitate, which generates a competitive advantage. These collective bricolage processes assume favorable initial conditions and an evolution from a constraining symbolic (standard ERP, best practices) to an enabling symbolic. Along the way, bricolage contributes to developing thecreative reservoir and capacities, which in turn increases the potential of bricolage, while simultaneously promoting technological and managerial innovations."
We began this PhD research on the topic of absenteeism in industrial plants of Mali. This study on absenteeism allowed me to mention the regular presence of some women at work. That is why; the PhD Director Pascale de Rozario recommended focusing our research on this topic. The implementation and processing of data in liaise with the theoretical model of Max Weber allowed to identify four ideal types of presenteeist employee women: The traditional presenteeist woman influenced by funerals and burials. The affective presenteeist woman influenced by colleagues and managers’ support. The valued presenteeist woman whose behavior is justified by relatives support and her financial contribution towards those relatives. The rationale presenteeist influenced by standing orders and financial punishments resorting to respect of statutory acts.
"Empirical studies of mobile technology in education are scarce. According to the literature review, different theoretical studies criticizing the current models of technology acceptance and adoption are seeking for changes, but not many research works have been conducted in the field. There are few empirical data about the university’s strategy in adoption and implementation of mobile technology as well.This research confirms the lack of such empirical studies, especially regarding user’s responses to mobile technology and their adaptation strategies in education. Hence, more rigorous research is needed to understand the perceptions and adaptation process of university’ participants. Furthermore, the literature review suggests a lack of theoretical consensus on adaptation of mobile technology in education.Theory shows that the education needs a holistic view of mobile technology adoption and investigation of its different aspects and components. Few research works were conducted in investigating a whole organizational implementation.This dissertation aims at understanding the strategy of university for adopting and implementing the mobile technology.This research is articulated around two main research questions:•	Why is mobile technology used in higher education? (at the strategic level)•	How is mobile technology used in higher education?This study is an exploratory research in order to allow the theory to emerge from the empirical results and this research is inspired from the Grounded Theory.In total, two case studies were conducted. Two French engineering universities were selected as our fields of study:•	First case study is carried out during a 6-month direct observation at engineering university A (equal to 1155 hours) including 193 students and 88 faculty members.•	Second case study is carried out during a 4-month direct observation at engineering university B (equal to 704 hours) including 115 students and 29 faculty members.In addition, 15 semi-directive interviews were conducted with professors in charge of mobile technology project, the university’ director, head of the department as well as IT and administrative staff. All data were coded and analyzed.During this research, we constantly compared our findings and the coded data to the emerging incidents and to the emerging concepts with the purpose of generating categories and comparing with the findings acquired from the fields of research.The main contributions can be classified into four categories:• Utilization of mobile technology (according to students, faculty members use),• An analysis of the participant’s perceptions of the adopted mobile technology• An analysis of participant’s coping activities (IT related, Task related and self-related) and three phases of adaptation process (individual, organizational, and group level)• A study of the main university’s strategy towards the adoption of mobile technology and how far it supports changes towards mobile technology appropriation.The conclusion brings managerial implications, theoretical implications and some recommendations for further studies in order to deepen the research and to answer several hypotheses issued from our results."
"This PhD dissertation provides useful empirical contributions for two research topics about flexicurity: the use of the short-time compensation (STC) program by French establishments and the role of the three “bases” of flexicurity – employment contract, skills and territory (Freyssinet, 2006) – in making professional career paths secure. About the first topic, we develop a methodology to analyse the efficiency of STC and to verify if it could be considered as a flexicurity tool. According to two efficiency criteria (avoiding redundancies and establishment exit), STC does not protect employment and so it is inefficient: Between 1995 and 2005, it represents mainly a flexibility tool. It can not been seen as a tool responding to the principles of flexicurity. In the line of the second topic, we analyse how the “bases” of flexicurity make professional career paths secure, by focusing on three professional mobilities: first employment-employment, employment-employment and unemployment-employment. We show the importance of temporary contracts, firm networks and individual’s place of residence in the process of making professional career paths secure. We show that: (i) fixed-term contracts secure professional trajectories if the link between individuals and firms is long enough; (ii) firm networks support the acquisition of skills, making easier professional mobilities; (iii) a “disadvantaged” place of residence seems to be an obstacle in making professional career paths secure."
"The onset of euro crisis has rekindled the policy debate regarding credit risk interdependenceamong sovereign-bank nexus. In this vein, the importance of real sector is overlooked whileformulating corrective measures for the recovery of economic growth in EMU. This thesispresents a study that examined these issues in euro zone. First, we evaluate spillover effect ofeuro crisis on borrowing cost of non-financial firms in presence of austerity measures (Chapter-I).Our results suggest significant effect especially where creditor rights protection are weak. Inaddition during recent crisis, results indicate presence of credibility channel due to austeritymeasures whereas; there is slight indication of aggregate demand channel before crisis. Second,we find traditional function of bank’s liquidity creation as a significant conduit of sovereign distressto real sector (Chapter-II). Particularly, our main finding shows that bank liquidity risk acts as aconduit which propagates uncertainty towards non-financial firms and re-channels it back torespective government. Finally, we examine cross-market credit risk dynamics among sovereignbank-firm nexus to identify presence of contagion during euro crisis period (Chapter-III). Ourresults report grave evidence of credit risk contagion across sectors and member states incorresponding financial markets in EMU. Moreover like peripheral countries, simulation results toshock in core countries risk premia strongly provide evidence of contagion towards remainingeuro zone."
"While innovation is open and based on the networking of different actors, small and medium enterprises(SME) have a rising role to play in this field. French clusters, formal (as local productive systems,competitiveness clusters etc.) and informal, have significantly contributed to the SME innovation capacity byoffering them specific knowledge and skills that they couldn’t acquire if they remained isolated. The mainbody of this thesis is constructed within this perspective and seeks to shed a new light on the inter-enterpriseinnovation linkages. More precisely, the aim is to analyze the determinants of innovation of SMEs taking intoaccount their cooperation for innovation at a local, regional or national level. Within this scope, we develop atheoretical framework based on an analysis of different approaches of innovation, enhanced with elements ofthe geography of innovation proximity. This framework is then verified on empirical data firstly, at a regionallevel by studding different SME clusters of the Center Region and then, at a national level in an econometricstudy based on the survey data of Innovation (CIS4) on innovative SMEs. To conclude, the results show thatSMEs’ capacity to innovate arises from an internal and external complex process that, given the limitedresources of SMEs, should be based on effective innovation systems at different levels. SMEs’ cooperationfor innovation both in regional clusters and in national innovation systems can thus contribute to the creationof an ecosystem that is suitable for innovation."
"Systemic risk has played a key role in the propagation of the last global financial crisis. A large number ofsystemic risk measures have been developed to quantify the contribution of a financial institution to thesystem-wide risk. However, numerous questions about their abilities to identify Systemically ImportantFinancial Institutions (SIFIs) have been raised since systemic risk has multiple facets, and some of themare difficult to gauge, such as the commonalities across financial institutions.The main goal of this dissertation in finance is thus (i) to propose an empirical solution to identifydomestic SIFIs, (ii) to compare theoretically and empirically different systemic risk measures, and (iii)to measure changes in banks’ risk exposures.First, chapter 1 offers an adjustment of three market-based systemic risk measures, designed in a globalframework, to identify domestic SIFIs. Second, chapter 2 introduces a common framework in whichseveral systemic risk measures are expressed and compared. It is theoretically shown that those systemicrisk measures can be expressed as function of traditional risk measures. The empirical application confirmsthese findings and shows that these measures fall short in capturing the multifaceted nature of systemicrisk. Third, chapter 3 proposes the Factor Implied Risk Exposures (FIRE) methodology which breaksdown a change in risk disclosure into a market volatility component and a bank-specific risk exposurecomponent. This chapter empirically illustrates that changes in risk exposures are positively correlatedacross banks, which is consistent with banks exhibiting commonality in trading."
"The interest of non-linear models is, on the one hand, to better take into account non-linearities characterizing themacroeconomic and financial series and, on the other hand, to get richer information in forecast. At this level,originality intervals (asymmetric and / or discontinuous) and forecasts densities (asymmetric and / or multimodal)offered by this new modelling form suggests that improving forecasts according to linear models is possible and thatwe should have enough powerful tests of evaluation to check this possible improvement. Such tests usually meanchecking distributional assumptions on violations and probability integral transform processes respectively associatedto each of these forms of forecast. In this thesis, we have adapted the GMM framework based on orthonormalpolynomials designed by Bontemps and Meddahi (2005, 2012) to test for some probability distributions, an approachalready adopted by Candelon et al. (2011) in the context of backtesting Value-at-Risk. In addition to the simplicity androbustness of the method, the tests we have developed have good properties in terms of size and power. The use of ournew approach in comparison of linear and non-linear models in an empirical analysis confirmed the idea according towhich the former are preferred if the goal is the calculation of simple point forecasts while the latter are moreappropriated to report the uncertainty around them."
"This thesis focuses on evaluating the ""Prospects of Inflation Targeting in the WAEMU countries"" in the wakeof the new institutional reform followed by the WAMU and the BCEAO. This reform must be accompanied byan explicit operational strategy insofar as its major innovations are very close to a policy of inflation targeting.Accordingly, we assess the impact of monetary policy of the BCEAO that focused on fixed exchange ratesince independence. In this respect, we manifest the inability of the fixed exchange rate policy to anchorinflation expectations in the WAEMU countries and the potential contribution regarding the announcement oftarget in controlling inflation (Chapter 1). In addition, we demonstrate, on the one hand, that the fixedexchange rate policy was not the cause of inflation contained in the WAEMU, and on the other, it providespoor results in terms of high and sustained economic growth (Chapter 2). Consequently, we recommend aframework of combination of an intermediate exchange rate regime and an inflation targeting strategy forWAEMU countries. Hence, an inflation target has been determined and it appears to be different from onecountry to another, against the 2% target announced by the Monetary Policy Committee of the BCEAO(Chapter 3). Finally, we define the inflation targeting rule, and show that the best optimal rule that monetaryauthorities adopt in an inflation targeting framework should ideally, reconciles nominal anchor and economicregulation (Chapter 4)."
"This thesis contributes to the literature in three main areas of research about capital structure: the determinants of capital structure, the profitability and the labour demand. (i) The theoretical basis of the determinants of capital structure shows that there are three models that explains the capital structure: Trade-Off theory, Pecking Order theory and Market Timing theory. Further, the empirical evaluation shows a positive effect of the adjustment costs and the tangibility. On the other hand, growth opportunity, non-debt tax shield and profitability are negatively correlated with debt. (ii) The impact of capital structure on profitability can be explained by three essential theories: signal theory, tax theory and the agency costs theory. The empirical analysis allowed to distinguish three different groups of sectors: for the first group, the capital structure has no impact on profitability. The second, it is the group where the debt affects negatively the profitability in a linear way. The last group is characterized by the presence of a negative effect in a linear and nonlinear way. (iii) Theoretically, a negative impact of the capital structure on labour demand is expected. The empirical application shows heterogeneity of behavior between sectors regarding the impact of debt on the demand for labor; therefore, there are three different groups of sectors (i.e. no effect, negative linear effect, and linear and non linear negative effect). Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect of debt on the labour demand and on the profitability depends not only of the sector, but also of the size of company."
"Le Bris, collecting about 200,000 data on French stocks from 1854 to 1988, builds a performance index. Several biases leading to overestimate the returns in prior French indices are demonstrated, as well as other probable examples across the globe.Over the long run, French stocks provide a better return than other assets, but without any excessive premium.Compared to US stocks, French stocks have underperformed since 1914, including during the periods of peace.The French stock market is highly sensitive to governmental changes, and overperforms under the left ones.A new method to identify market crashes is proposed. This method identifies crashes that are consistent withhistory.Firms from service industries have almost always dominated market capitalization since 1854.The rationality of the French investments in Russian bonds, before 1914, is demonstrated thanks to a portfoliooptimization among French assets (stock, bonds and corporate bonds) and eight international state bonds.A new method to decompose the benefit of diversification is proposed; before 1914, French investors wereclearly attracted by low foreign correlation rather than higher foreign returns.French and US stocks present a long-term rise in correlation, probably following the economic integration.Thus, the incentive to diversify through international markets has decreased.The market risk exhibits a significant rise during the interwar-period, and the pre-1914 level is never reachedagain. This risk appears to be linked to the end of the Gold Standard, the inflation rate and the public deficits.The consequence of the rise of this common risk is that the correlation among French stocks trend upwards, andthen, reduce the domestic portfolio effect; reversely, before 1914, a “super portfolio effect” is identified."
"Recent attempts explaining the links between economy and environment allowed to start interesting new horizons of research. The main question that arises for the cities of Sub-Saharan Africa is to know how the authorities can sustainably manage the growing household waste. This thesis addresses this issue with two important concerns. Although the management of household wastehas been outsourced to private players, the expected effectiveness is not obtained. By mobilizing elements of the theory of externalities and contract theory, we showed that for effective private intervention in the household waste sector, it is necessary that the two actors (municipality and privateactors) could have a strong connection to overcome the difficulties related to the asymmetry of information and opportunistic behavior that generates the risk of having barrier for exchange. The second concern is related to the households’ responsibility for the waste they produce. The Empirical studies show, on the one hand, that pricing incentive in the areas of upper and middle class willenable, at the same time, the Municipality to generate the additional financial resources for financing their service and, on the other hand, to reduce the volume of waste destined for final discharge. Secondly, promotion of source separation accompanied by the establishment of a perfect market recovery of sorted waste encourages low-income households and inhabitants in the neighborhood of lower classes to participate in sorting."
"This thesis is concerned with the effects of inflation on output growth and on its determinants. In the first step, ourstudy analyzes two aspects of the inflation–growth relationship. First, it examines the nonlinearity of the relationshipbetween inflation and output growth and identifies several thresholds for the global sample and for various incomespecificsub-samples. Secondly, it identifies some country-based macroeconomic features that influence thisnonlinearity. Our empirical results substantiate both views and validate the fact that the inflation–growth nonlinearityis sensitive to a country’s trade openness capital accumulation, and government expenditures (chapter 2). After that,we explain this inflation–growth nonlinearity by testing a Tobin effect of inflation on physical capital and asubstitution effect – from work to education – for human capital. We find that the positive effects of moderateinflation rate are due to the Tobin effect on physical capital whereas a weak negative effect of high inflation ratestems from a better human capital accumulation. We identify a strong role of well developed financial systems in allthese mechanisms (chapter 3). Lastly, we address a lack of coherence between the macro based optimal inflationthresholds for output growth and the actual preferences of central banks around the world. We notice that centralbanks use micro based New-Keynesian models and their optimal inflation rate is the one that minimizes dispersionsin factors and product markets. We test the effect of inflation on relative price variability and output growthvariability and, for all income groups, the results support a slight positive inflation rate to minimize theseuncertainties. For our selected emerging economies, monetary policy regimes also affect these dispersions (chapter4)."
"Over the years numerical modelling and simulation techniques have constantly been improved with the increase in their use. While keeping the computational resources in mind, numerical simulations are usually adapted to the required degree of accuracy and quality of results. The conventional Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (RANS) is a robust, cheap but less accurate approach. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) provides very detailed and accurate results to the some of the most complex turbulence cases but at higher computational cost. On the other hand, Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is although the most accurate of the three approaches but at the same time it is computationally very expensive which makes it very difficult to be applied to the most of the complex industrial problems. The current work is aimed to develop a deeper understanding of multi-hole Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) sprays which pose many complexities such as; air entrainment in the multi-hole spray cone, Jet-to-Jet interactions, and changes in the spray dynamics due to the internal flow of the injector. RANS approach is used to study multi-hole injector under cold, hot and superheated conditions. Whereas, LES is utilized to investigate the changes in the dynamics of the single spray plume due to the internal flow of the GDI injector. To reduce computational cost of the simulations, dynamic mesh refinement has been incorporated for both LES and RANS simulation. A thorough investigation of air entrainment in three and six hole GDI injectors has been carried out using RANS approach under non superheated and superheated conditions. The inter plume interactions caused by the air entrainment effects have been analysed and compared to the experimental results. Moreover, the tendencies of semi collapse and full collapse of multi-hole sprays under non superheated and superheated conditions have been investigated in detail as well. A methodology of LES has been established using different injection strategies along with various subgrid scale models for a single spray plume. In GDI multi-hole sprays, the internal flow of the injector plays a very crucial role in the outcome the spray plume. A separate already available internal flow LES simulation of the injector has been coupled with the external spray simulation in order to include the effect of nozzle geometry and the cavitation phenomenon which completely change the dynamics of the spray."
"This thesis deals with the interactions between inflation targeting strategies and their institutional framework inemerging economies. More precisely, empirical investigations conducted in this thesis aim to study the role ofthe institutional framework in the conduct and efficiency of inflation targeting. To this end, we proceed in twosteps. First, we consider the institutional framework as exogenous to inflation targeting adoption and analyzewhether this framework has impacted macroeconomic performance of inflation targeting countries. Thus, afterlaying the conceptual background of inflation targeting and showing the importance of economic andinstitutional prerequisites in the choice of emerging countries of adopting this monetary policy strategy (chapter1), we show that some institutional conditions can strengthen the performance of inflation targeting countries interms of inflation level and volatility (chapter 2). Then, in a second step, we consider the institutionalframework as endogenous to inflation targeting and analyze the response of authorities to the adoption of thismonetary policy strategy. The first result that emerges is that the adoption of inflation targeting provides strongincentives to government for improving fiscal discipline, especially the collection of domestic tax revenue(chapter 3). Finally, we analyze the exchange rate policy of inflation targeting emerging economies and showthat the pursuit of two nominal targets, inflation and exchange rate, can be counterproductive in terms ofmacroeconomic performance, more particularly when this exchange rate management is motivated by financialstability considerations (chapitre 4). Hence the importance for inflation targeting candidates of conductingstructural reforms to increase financial development."
"The 2008/2009 global financial crisis has revived the debate on the concern for financial stability in themonetary policy-making, stressing the need to reconsider the role of central banks in ensuring financialstability. The crisis has also pointed some flaws in the existing (micro) prudential regulation and therelevance to move toward a broader regulatory framework aiming to prevent systemic risk. This thesis isbuilt upon these issues. It investigates the extent to which financial stability may be of particular concernin a context where the main monetary policy objective is inflation stabilization (typically, in an inflationtargeting regime –IT–). It further assesses how the macroprudential framework and monetary policy canbe articulated to ensure the best outcome in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability (Chapter I).The conclusions derived from this work suggest that, faced with the recent global financial turmoil,inflation targeting central banks have been more able to mitigate the shock, certainly thanks to higherpolicy credibility (Chapter II). However, we evidence that IT countries (especially in EMEs) are morefinancially vulnerable than their non-IT counterparts, despite central banks’ response to financial risks(Chapter III). Following the latter conclusion, we investigate more closely the effectiveness of the leaningagainst the wind strategy. We show that such a policy response generates trade-offs between thefinancial and macroeconomic stability objectives of the monetary authorities. The best stabilizationoutcome is achieved when an effective macroprudential framework is implemented, combined withhigher central bank’s concern with financial risks (Chapter IV). Furthermore, we show that in EMEsITers, foreign exchange interventions are used to mitigate their financial vulnerability to external shocks,although the IT regime requires a fully floating exchange rate regime (Chapter V)."
"This thesis investigates the effect of banking competition on the cost and the quality of lending to firms by financial institutions. Specifically, the empirical analyzes conducted in this thesis aim to reach two complementary objectives. First, assessing the degree to which the rivalry between banks influences their pricing strategy and therefore the cost of corporate financing. The second objective of this thesis is to study the impacts of bank competition on the way banks generate private information about their customers. To this end we proceed in two steps. First, we investigate whether banking competition affects the type of information used by loan officers to assess borrower’s quality. Then, we check the involvement of bank competition in the termination of bank-firm relationships. We consider for all the analyzes conducted in this thesis an approach where the complementarity between different competition indicators used in the literature is exploited in order to better understand the level of rivalry among banks. Several results emerge from the multiple empirical analyzes conducted in this thesis. First, these show that the market power of financial institutions result from two separate sources: the weight of the bank in the local credit market structure, and the level of efficiency of the credit institution. Therefore, the impact of competition between banks depends on the ability of banking competition to influence the local market structure of credit or the efficiency of bank. Moreover, we show that within a concentrated banking market, the existence of strong rivalries between banks reduced the financing cost of firms that had a house bank. Finally, we demonstrate that banking competition increases the duration of bank-firm relationships and encourages loan officers to produce more private information about borrowers. However, it would be safe for banks to monitor the behavior of loan officers regarding their role on information production, in order to design incentives that ensure a sustained effort on their part."
"Monetary innovations, giving money new forms and characteristics, are now used to promote the process of economic development. In Kenya, they unfold in mobile money systems such as M-Pesa, as well as in several local currencies implemented on the model of the Bangla-Pesa. These monies have different natures and logics, and the thesis aims to show their impacts and implications. For this, we use data from two field surveys.Monetary innovations challenge development theories, which have largely excluded money from their analyzes, and which generally consider it to be neutral. The study of these schemes allow us to lay the foundations of a monetary theory of development. By doing so, we question the meaning of the concept of development, and the roles that money and finance have to play for it."
"The objective of this research is to prove that good economical and commercial practices exist and that they can be adopted by any actor who aims to develop a relationship between the Popular Republic of China and the occidental mediterranean countries. In order to answer to the expectations of the stakeholders and thus to facilitate the economical and territorial development with the aid of the proposed model, this research work highlights, in a first step, a precise analysis of the commercial exchanges and the economical cooperation between the Popular Republic of China and the western mediterranean countries that are now integrated in a worldwide global context. After the observation step, we have wished to modelize the processes that are linked to the territorial economical development. We used a reading method which comes from the transregional integration and which is focused on the relations between China and the occidental mediterranean countries. This is the reason why our research question will try to prove which territorial and economical development model must be implemented between the Popular Republic of China and the occidental mediterranean countries in a vision of win-win mutual prosperity. In order to answer to this question, we have established a transregional integration model which is inspired by the Chinese philosophy Yi Jing. This philosophy has the advantage to take into account the western thinking scheme as well as the oriental philosophy. This allows the facilitation of the reciprocal territorial and economical development."
"Tourism is a booming economic sector that tends to incorporate the sustainable sites into its strategies. Sustainable development, which in the strategy to improve the quality of life for all without causing adverse environmental and socio-cultural outcome, gradually come into sight. However, the tour guide plays a key role in the tourism industry. As a person who assures the contact between supply and demand, it has an essential function for the advancement of tourism in a sustainable direction. Given the absence of research in this area, we chose to focus ours on this issue based on a case study in China. Three research objectives were then identified: Understanding Sustainable Development and the relationships with tourism; exploring the roles and responsibilities of tour guides and their involvement in promoting sustainability; examining why the tour guides actually exercise their functions in order to support the development of sustainable tourism. After the literature review and application of triangulation methods in this thesis - interviews, participant observation and questionnaire survey -, we recommend to orient the practices in the tourism industry towards a healthy and sustainable development in a hierarchical structure: (1) Ameliorate the certification, optimize the training program, strengthen the control of tourist guides; (2) Promote the functions of the Guild of tour guides; (3) Improve the working conditions of guides and reinforce the education for sustainable development in this industry."
"This research examines the determinants of mergers and acquisitions. Over the years, the number and magnitude of corporate mergers and acquisitions has grown considerably. Today, these operations are at the heart of the economy and business strategy. As a result of its evolution, this issue represents a major interest for the academic world and for companies in their logic of external growth. Our research aims to enrich the analysis on these operations by focusing on the impact of the environment and on the actors. The aim is to identify in the French context the factors influencing the nature of the players involved in mergers and acquisitions. A logistic regression analysis allowed us to analyze these determinants. Over the period 2003-2014, we analyzed 114 mergers and acquisitions of companies in the pharmaceutical industry. The results show that the search for innovation is not a significant factor in these operations. Also, the proximity in the broad sense of the actors positively influences the operations. Finally, mergers and acquisitions transactions change differently depending on the business cycle of the transaction period"
"Advance in information technology allows companies and customers working together to developinnovations. Firms widely rely on this online co-creation movement through idea generation toolkitsand the underlying mechanisms of user-firms interactions become a challenging topic to investigatefor both theory and practice. Across three articles, we aim to better understand user innovationsdeterminants. In the first article proposition, we build on lead user literature to investigate the actorscontributing to external innovations. Second, we explore the notion of tool performance as mean tofacilitate innovation. We identify that online tools, such as ideation platform and Open SourceSoftware need to aggregate several conditions leading to promote innovative outputs. Finally, wefocus on the overall process allowing firms to entirely externalize the idea generation process andmethods to improve this process. We propose a theoretical model built on problem-solving and needsolution pairs theories. Overall, the findings extend both user innovation and crowdsourcing literatureand provide practical implications for virtual search for innovations. The investigations of three levelof analysis: actors, tools and methods is critical. The three articles of our thesis could help firms toincrease interactions with expert users. This research could also provide better understanding on howto design ideation toolkits to maximize innovative context. Finally, our theoretical model might helpfirms to optimize the search for innovative solutions via an adapted process for problem formulation."
"This thesis is in the fields of public management and management control. It aims to shed light on the management control function in local authorities by building, a typology of management controllers on one hand, and on other hand identifying certain organizational factors explaining the different types territorial management controllers highlighted. With this in mind, an analysis of the role of territorial management controller based on academic literature and previous research is presented. Then an empirical study combining qualitative and quantitative methodology, and about the management control in local council communities, identifies four types of territorial management controllers: namely respectively strategist, councillor, partner and analyst. The role of each type of territorial management controller is then qualified, that role seems to be particularly linked to the extent of powers and the numbers of partners in the latter local council community."

"The main theme of this thesis are macro-financial linkages. I covered three different questions related to this topic. In the first chapter Gaël Giraud and I develop a model for the Euro Area answering to many of the critiques of policy models before the Global Financial Crisis and with a focus on the interaction between the financial sector and the macroeconomy. The second and third chapter focus on behaviour of the financial sector in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis and its implications for the macroeconomy. Chapter 2 investigates the practice of forbearance towards stressed borrowers. The ultimately relevant question in this chapter is to what extend there is a feedback to the real economy due to this behaviour. Finally, the third chapter sheds light on an episode of manipulation in commodity markets. This alleged manipulation was apparently only possible due to the dominant market position banks took in the run up to the crisis and thereafter. Ultimately I quantify the effects of such behaviour and provide evidence of a structural change of the manipulated market during the period of alleged manipulation. The first chapter exploits a bank level dataset, whereas in chapter 2 and 3 I develop structural macroeconomic models. Especially the dynamical system model in the second chapter is an innovation. This class of models and more specifically a model of the size we develop has never been estimated and subsequently used for policy analysis."
"This work deals with the logic of action enabling Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to integrate the SMEs. Today’s society is evolving because of increasing social inequalities and the growing need for the reduction of negative influences of human activity on natural environment. At the heart of these social problems, there are the corporations, which are more and more obliged to integrate sustainable development matters in the way they operate. Since the SMEs represent a consequent part of the economic fabric, it is essential for them to appropriate CSR and assimilate it in their operating methods. However, SMEs operate in a particular way, notably because they are limited in terms of resource and because they have a strong proximity with their stakeholders, which they have to sustain. Nonetheless, just like big corporations, they want to improve performance through strategic choices. In that respect, we question ourselves on how CSR is integrated in SMEs through the implementation of sustainable practices as well as the induced performance.  Literature gives two logic of action enabling the integration of CSR in corporations: sustainable entrepreneurial logic and sustainable managerial logic. Research in SMEs presents the sustainable entrepreneurial logic as a preferred method for the inclusion of these matters. Starting from these first elements, we elaborate a conceptual model that allows us to evaluate the importance of entrepreneurial initiative and sustainable entrepreneurial logic in the implementation of sustainable activity in the SME. This model also aims at clarifying the stakeholders’ role in the CSR procedure in SMEs as well as the impact on performance. Before we test this model, starting from an exploratory qualitative study and literature, we develop a measurement indicator of sustainable entrepreneurial logic. The conceptual model is then tested through the structural equation on a sample of 402 French SMEs. This data was gathered thanks to a questionnaire survey. We then highlight the importance of sustainable entrepreneurial logic in the implementation of CSR in SMEs, as a way of seizing opportunities, innovating or creating social and economic value. However, the study doesn’t show any of the positive effects that CSR has on performance, nor the influence of stakeholders on this relation."
"The aim of this thesis is to bring to light the way the Risk management mobilizes the stakeholders of organizations to create and lead a culture of the operational risk.Our research approach is the methodological triangulation, combining two action-research case studies, arising within a banking institution and within an insurance company, as well as semi-directive interviews and an analysis of contents on a set of internal documents in each of the studied cases. The research results state the necessity of translating the standards of prudential control in the organization and of structuring the numerous controls to implement an effective risk mastering policy.The recent statutory evolutions in the banking and insurance sectors (Basel 2 and Basel 2.5, Basel 3, Solvency II) tend to strengthen systems of internal control and Risk Management as well as the communication of information over these devices for a better control of the risks. So, the regulation CRBF 97-02 speaks about operational risk systems, the directive to come Solvency II evokes in its pillar 2 the necessity of developing an internal control and a Risk Management turned to the consideration of the organizational risks.However these efforts do not prevent the emergence and the mediatization of financial scandals the scale of which is as high as the financial handled amounts. So, numerous financial institutions are affected by the operational risk. This risk is before any an organizational risk, a contingent of the human factor and taking multiple forms (the Basel categories of the operational risk).There are numerous examples of extremes operational risks: the cases of JP Morgan, UBS, Société Générale, Barclays, Goldman Sachs give evidence of it. However, the operational risk is not only the fact of corporate and investment banking and is not only an extreme risk by its consequences and in low probability. It also concerns retail banks and insurance companies and is most of the time a risk of frequency and low impact (frauds in payment activities, and fraud in life and non-life the insurance for instance). The prudential regulation include a set of standards tending to incite financial institutions to take into account better this category still emergent and badly known by risk (markets risks or credits risks have being the object of more studies).We describe the influence of these normative evolutions on the internal devices of the operational risk (Operational Risk Management, Internal Control) and we question the sense given by establishments to the information onto the control of the risks, more particularly as regards the effectiveness of these devices. To avoid an informative overload regarding control, it becomes essential to place this prudent regulation in perspective of structuring of the controls and the translation / understanding of the risk control standards."

It also concerns retail banks and insurance companies and is most of the time a risk of frequency and low impact (frauds in payment activities, and fraud in life and non-life the insurance for instance). The prudential regulation include a set of standards tending to incite financial institutions to take into account better this category still emergent and badly known by risk (markets risks or credits risks have being the object of more studies).We describe the influence of these normative evolutions on the internal devices of the operational risk (Operational Risk Management, Internal Control) and we question the sense given by establishments to the information onto the control of the risks, more particularly as regards the effectiveness of these devices. To avoid an informative overload regarding control, it becomes essential to place this prudent regulation in perspective of structuring of the controls and the translation / understanding of the risk control standards."
"Year after year, multi-drug resistant bacteria expand over the world and among alternative to antibiotics, phage therapy appears as one of the most promising approach. This work is dedicated to a feasibility approach in order to evaluate phage therapy potential in the most frequent and severe complication in the intensive care unit context: the ventilator-associated pneumonia. We focused on a commonly involved bacterium which is also highly affected by antibiotic resistance: Escherichia Starting from a large multicenter collection of strains (n=316) isolated from airways of mechanically ventilated patients, we showed that there was no practical impediment to get a phage collection able to target efficiently a large range of strains as we observed that 5 phages were able to cover 70% of the collection. We then experimentally demonstrated that two phages were able to rescue deadly infected mice in a murine pneumonia model. By using the bioluminescence imaging tool, we also observed that the kinetic of bacterial load decrease obtained with the phage treatment was as fast as the one obtained with a reference antibiotic. Finally, we concentrated on a specialized phage (LM33-P1) that turned out to be only able to infect 025b strains, a worrisome serotype in terms of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity. LM33-P1 was able to lyse 74% of 025b strains and its specificity was shown to be LPS-dependent. We also demonstrated that this phage was biologically active in vivo. These results provide new knowledge allowing the consideration of phage therapy development in the field of respiratory infections due to E. Coh, in the context of mechanical ventilation but not only. "

"Within the organizations, the turnover when limited can have a positive influence on the resources’ renewal. But when it grows, it badly affects the organization leading to a management of the immediate, jeopardizing people and company’s effectiveness. Veolia Group is suffering from this regular organizational move, when its core business is made of services and where people are the key quality asset. On top of that, the company encourages an ambitious training policy in order to integrate, professionalize, and retain employees. To be successful, the company relies on the classroom learning (alternation). Therefore, can we claim that alternation has a direct impact on turnover’s decrease?Thanks to a quasi-experimental design approach, using an investigation so called longitudinal per questionnaire strengthened by a group of control, a theoretical design explaining the relationship alternation-turnover in the organizational frame was tested in France over a French population of production units. Alternation shows the emergence of a dialectical relationship human being-organization, monitored by the creation of a strong psychological contract and a double tutorial system. Mixing my results with 18 interviews of so called validation, it appears that alternation develops an organizational socialization only partial, due to the difficulty in the understanding of its own role at the end of the journey. The shift from a tutorial function to a tutorial system is also highlighted in my results, where the learning of the job is supported by the working community and the lead-tutor continues playing a mentor role. Lastly, according my study, when well managed, alternation can prevent the turnover, by supporting the development of a strong involvement within the organization. Therefore, I suggest the set up of a specific management unit for alternates, considering not anymore the alternation as a training tool but also as human resource tool enabling talents’ discovery."
"The evolution of the new practices of the socially responsible investment opens the way for innovative modes of organization. A big market was born between supply and demand, new ""transactional architectures"" proposing socially responsible bond issues. The objective being to create the liquidity and to contribute to the economic and social development.The study of the organizational arrangements which succeeded to emit a socially responsible obligation aimed at the management company feeds on two experiences pioneers. The organizational context brings us to wonder about the place of the fund manager in the financing of the united economy. The asset management, at the heart of the organization modes, is positioned between the bond issuer and the investors wishing to integrate extra-financial dimension into their choices of selection of asset.The problem of our research work is interested in the study of the attractiveness of the asset managers in the face of mechanisms differentiated of Voluntary and united Sector.So, within the framework of this thesis, we suggest studying the perception from the point of view of the fund manager of two different modes of organization, which end in the construction of a product qualified as SRI in the sense where he meets the expectations of investors wishing to integrate extra-financial dimensions into their choices of selection of products.From this perspective, the fund manager SRI is brought to make decisions as for the choice of products in its process of construction of the portfolio. He plays double role of construction social performance and financial intermediary and has to face a set of constraints of management but also towards these partners."
"This research focuses on shopping centers and on the shopping and consuming experiences produced and undergone within these retail spaces in different cities and in different regions of the world. Although significant work has been done on this topic in developed economies, significantly less has been devoted to emerging economies and even less has been done in comparative terms. This work builds on the existing Consumer Culture Theory related literature and it attempts to address current gaps in this body of work, as well as to provide managerial recommendations based on research findings. It differentiates itself from previous research on shopping centers on four main aspects: (1) By studying the phenomenon of shopping centers in Latin America, a largely unexplored domain; (2) By adding a multicultural perspective to the body of research on consumer and shopping experiences at shopping centers through the study of cases in five different cities; (3) By establishing a process of case selection to provide a priori variability of cases; (4) By comparing on ¨continuum¨ (Carù & Cova, 2007; Roederer, 2008) the full array of shopping experiences: produced, undergone and co-driven (Csaba and Askegaard, 1999; Tsai, 2010) and assessing whether these experiences vary across locations as well as the possible causes of variation."
"Monetary valuation of health impacts is increasingly used to support decision process, often relying mainly on economic criteria, and to take into account preferences of concerned people. This use leads to questioning the reliability of the methods and their adaptation to the context of decisions support. This work aims at determining the robustness of monetary values of health impacts estimated by contingent valuation via the following question: does the cause of the assessed health impact influence its monetary value? Economic theory outlines that, on the one hand monetary value of an health impact should depend on its characteristics only and not on its causes, on the other hand all information useful to the valuation should be provided. In practice, contingent valuations sometimes state the causes, with inconsistent results. A contingent valuation was conducted to analyze the effect of cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with four versions of the questionnaire: the cause is not indicated, the causes are said to be mainly smoking and air pollution, the cause is said to be air pollution only, and smoking only. Results show that stipulating the possible causes increases the acceptability of the questionnaire. The willingness to pay depends less on the causes but more on the personal characteristics of the respondents, especially their health and environment (healthy diet, sport practice, pollution in living area).  To conclude, providing information about the causes of the valued health impact would increase the reliability of the assessment. Uncertainties remain high in particular as this valuation stays unusual in France where the National Health Service covers most of health expenses."
"The development of innovation clusters has opened several research perspectives due to its importance in the academic world and in the managerial practices. The purpose of this research is to mobilize the Triple Helix model ""State, Industry, Academy"" in order to identify forms of governance favouring innovation of clusters. We have attached particular importance on the role played by the state and the policies it conducts in the development of these structures.  The methodology is based on a qualitative approach based on ""case studies"". Three case studies were conducted on clusters mainly in the field of the Information Technology and Communication in Egypt: Smart Village of Cairo, Maadi Technology Park and Greek Campus. Data were collected from different sources (semi-structured interviews, non-participant observations, and secondary data). A complementary study was carried out on The Electronics, Mechanics and Mechatronics Cluster in Morocco and on the Morocco Microelectronics Cluster in order to reinforce the external validity of the research. Last but not least, we explored the case of CAPACITES; a knowledge valorization company created by the University of Nantes in France.  The results of the research confirm that the diversity of governance forms of the three Egyptian clusters (public, private, public-private partnership) impacted the strategies of innovation and entrepreneurship. This thesis proposes the model O2 Innovation for the innovation of the clusters. The model highlights the importance of spreading the culture of entrepreneurship while emphasizing on the primary role of the academy in an open innovation process."
"In a context in which corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business transfer appear to be two major challenges faced by French SMEs, a particular attention should be given to the CSR practices introduced by the external successor of SMEs. Thus, this article proposes to explore the effects of CSR practices initiated by external successors on their legitimacy among their employees. In the first part, a literature review on the concepts of legitimacy and CSR in the context of small businesses showed a convergence between the managerial implications of CSR and the determinants of legitimacy. The second part is devoted to an empirical analysis of this relationship. The research methodology is based on an exploratory approach, combining a multiple case study (9 cases analyzed, 46 interviews) and a questionnaire survey.Firstly, our results shed light on the means at the disposal of the successor to build his legitimacy among his employees ; then  the results  show the positive effect of the CSR practices on the three determinants of external successor’s legitimacy : a) instrumental, by allowing the external successor to develop his business and satisfy the economic interests of employees ; b) relational, through the positive impact of CSR on the fairness his HR practices ; c) moral, by offering him the opportunity to develop a new project around a set of ethical and moral values appreciated and shared by employees. Finally, this research identifies the different psychological mechanisms by which CSR contributes to the external successor’s legitimacy, as well as their influence factors."
"A substantive literature of medical tourism has been attributed to medical tourists' motivations. Academicians have studied medical tourists' experiences and resulting satisfaction level. Nevertheless, the link between these two concepts has seldom been examined in medical tourism literature. Thus, this study examines medical tourists’ motivations for medical tourism destination, the effect of those motivations on their perception of quality, satisfaction and intention to revisit. In addition, the study aims to explore the various characteristics of medical tourists which yields in classifying them into different segments. The objective is to investigate the attributes that attract medical tourists to the destination as well as possible ways to enhance their medical tourism experience and satisfaction. Empirically, the study aims to promote the medical tourism destination at business and national levels to a world-class level by addressing the motivations and perceptions of medical tourists. Theoretical foundations are drawn from push-pull theory, five steps decision-making process, in addition to  theories from service perceived quality and satisfaction literature. A conceptual framework was developed to illustrate the relationship between the study variables. The motivations were classified into push and pull. Pull motivations were classified into motivations associated with the destination, medical attributes, convenience and with price. Perceived quality was classified into medical and touristic. Methodologically, the study incorporates a triangulation approach where primary data were collected from suppliers involved in medical tourism via interviews and from medical tourists via survey. Eight interviews were conducted with suppliers of medical tourism in destination of study to obtain an in-depth insight into the subject matter as well as for further verification of quantitative knowledge development. A total of 212 responses were obtained from the survey for verification of the quantitative model using Structural Equation Modeling. Other data analysis techniques were employed, primarily Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The findings provide support to some hypothesized relationships.The pull motivations associated with medical attributes affect perceived medical quality and the pull motivations associated with destination, medical attributes and convenience affect perceived touristic quality. Both medical and touristic perceived quality affect satisfaction while satisfaction affected intention to revisit. The findings as well extend the applications of the underpinned theories in explaining consumer behavior in medical tourism. The main theories include five steps decision-making process and disconfirmation service quality theory. The implications of the research extend to business level and national level. The results can help managers involved in medical tourism businesses including clinics, medical centers, hotels and travel agencies to reallocate their resources and implement the recommended practices that can improve their performance and attract additional medical tourists. On a national level, the findings are significant to key decision makers in the fields of tourism and healthcare. The outcomes and recommendations can assist in increasing the attractiveness of the destination and improving the medical tourism experience which would result in economic benefit to the destination as a whole."
"This dissertation provides some evidence-based policy lessons focusing on the role of institutional, structural, and fiscal policies in achieving pro-poor and inclusive growth. The first chapter gives an overview of the dissertation and briefly discusses the main data issues and some stylized facts on inequality and poverty. The second chapter examines the role of good governance in fostering pro-poor and inclusive growth at the macroeconomic level. It shows that while all features of good governance enhance pro-poor growth, only government effectiveness and the rule of law tend to promote inclusive growth. The third chapter provides a cross-country analysis investigating how governments can reduce income inequality by changing the composition of public spending while keeping the total level fixed. The results show that reallocating defense spending towards education, and health spending and in particular social and infrastructure spending, is associated with reduced income inequality in countries with political stability. The fourth chapter provides a microeconomic perspective, focusing on how better performance of informal firms could promote shared prosperity in a context of fragility. It shows that firms’ performance is a key factor in explaining income differences between entrepreneurs. In addition, the chapter finds that human capital and managerial skills are important engines of informal firms’ performance."
"This thesis aims at explaining interactions among economic agents operating in the retail insurance market. On the one hand, the policyholder is willing to be covered against a risk. To do so, they have to explore the insurance market to purchase a contract in line with their risk perception. On the other hand, insurers compete in a regulated market which imposes capital constraints for shock loss absorption purposes. In between, intermediaries may provide services in order to facilitate interaction between risk-adverse consumers and risk-taker firms. In this context, we analyze economic behaviors of insurance actors through different perspectives. Chapter 1 and 2 both result from original laboratory experiments, conducted through a web-interface especially designed for these studies. Results in Chapter 3 rely on a theoretical model and numerical simulations. Chapter 1 emphasizes on the relationship between honesty and beliefs about honesty of economic agents. According to laboratory results, we show how the uncertainty and the perception of advantageous conditions impact the level of honesty and beliefs about honesty. In general, consumers estimate that intermediaries are more honest than they really are, hence supporting their physical presence in the insurance market. However, intermediary financial incentives are a source of distortion of honesty beliefs: the weaker the level of the incentive, the stronger the deviation anticipations. In Chapter 2, we shed light on the dilemma faced by insurance purchasers under a multichannel distribution. Should the consumer, themselves, choose from a large set of insurance policies, or rather delegate a part of their decision to a more or less honest intermediary? Using experimental approaches, including exogenous search costs, we show that obfuscation and beliefs about intermediary honesty are the main determinants of individual choices. We also find that obfuscation and intermediaries’ deviation are the main sources of inefficiency in decision-making, especially regarding the features of the insurance contracts chosen by consumers. Our identification of the focal point effect supports the importance of the price level on purchasing decisions rather than the risk environment or the coverage level. The introduction of search costs in the exploration process, as well as the heterogeneity of beliefs about honesty, justify multichannel distribution strategies adopted by insurers. An analysis of insurer price competition with a repeated one-period non-cooperative game is conducted in Chapter 3, where both insurer losses and consumer behaviors are stochastic. Because of regulatory obligations, we consider a solvency constraint when computing Nash-Equilibrium. We determine the sensitivity of the premium equilibrium with respect to the parameters, especially when firms do not benefit from same competitive advantages (i.e. reputation effect leading to differences in consumers inertia or market seniority leading to differences in capital stock). We also study insurers’ market share in response to the entry of new insurer undercutting prices but dealing with binding solvency constraints"
"Corporate environmental reporting is becoming more and more widespread and regulated. This dissertation specifically focuses on environmental accounting information (EAI) in this context. Our research draws on neo-institutional theory and concerns the concept of normativity. Three empirical studies, each dealing with one dimension of the information disclosure process, are conducted. They are all carried out in the French regulatory context. The first study examines how companies disclose EAI and the strategies adopted after the adoption of a new law. Based on a content analysis of the annual reports of 96 listed companies over the period 2009-2014, the results show that the law did not favor greater transparency in the EAI and we observe that companies choose different reponses to the law. The second study focuses on behind the scenes of these strategies to identify how producers of information organize themselves to respond to the regulations they are subject to. The results of 8 case studies show that two distinct strategies appear depending on the type of EAI. The third study focuses on the users of information behavior and how they react to the firms’ disclosure strategies. We consider the point of view of financial analysts by investigating the effect of firms’ EAI disclosure strategies on investment recommendations and perceptions of this item (as regards to both the relevance and credibility of information). Through an experimental study conducted with 145 participants, it turned out that these strategies modify both the perception of relevance and credibility of information. Overall, the dissertation contributes to our understanding of how companies (and actors) develop strategies to adapt to the introduction of new regulations."
"750 000 employments to keep. This number, highlight by the former deputy of Herault, Fanny Dombre-Coste, underline influence of SME takeovers on development of local economy. However, buyer, an entrepreneur, is understudied. We then engaged an academic research in order to fill in this gap and, using an entrepreneurial perspective, we try to better understand buyer profile. To confine profile question, we use a central concept in entrepreneurship: opportunity. Then, leaning on Kirzner logic, buyer function become clearly: he has to identify opportunity. How can he do it? He is going to use his alertness. So, we ask the following problematic: how does buyer entrepreneurial alertness influence takeover financial performance? To answer, we use an hypothetico-deductive reasoning and realise a quantitative research. This lead us to formulate hypotheses and build a research model. We put a link between entrepreneurial alertness (Tang et al., 2012) and two mediator's variables: opportunity identification (Ozgen et Baron, 2007) and entrepreneurial orientation (Covin et Slevin, 1989). Then, this two variables are linked to takeover financial performance – which is a subjective measure of the evolution of height indicators. After used MICOM procedure, we test our model on all buyers (n = 278) and make a comparison – qualitative and using a multi-group analysis – between buyers supported by a mentor (n = 199) and non-supported (n = 79), and between buyers supported before (n = 79) and after takeover (n = 120). Firstly, results show that entrepreneurial alertness is an antecedent of financial performance. On the other hand, our research underline that mentorship has the potential to add substantially to our understanding of how buyer succeed – at least on an financial plan – SME takeover. Consequently, it seems relevant to develop a cognitive part in buyer support program and to work on mentorship in this singular context."
"In our intervention research we investigate the making of prescription, that is, the organization of a design process of prescriptive documents used, in particular, for nuclear power plants. This project is part of a constructive approach to ergonomics.Building of an organizational diagnosis leads to characterize the studied process, transversal collective work it involves, and to develop specific tools for intervention. We implement a participatory design approach in order to design an experimental methodology which supports the organization of a transversal organizational. This experimentation refers to “the square” of the making of prescription. This leads to two main results: the development of a transversal collective work between participants involved, and the highlighting of a lack of subsidiarity within the studied organization.Design and experimentation of the methodology analysis contribute to produce knowledge about enabling ergonomics intervention: on the participatory design of the methodology itself, and on the enhancement of the role of social elaboration of an ergonomics intervention."
"Background: Air traffic, in constant increase during the last decades, is not without impact on the environment and the population. Aircraft noise in particular represents a serious nuisance and a major issue for public health, particularly in terms of sleep disturbances. However, in France especially, the effects of aircraft noise exposure remain insufficiently evaluated. Objectives: The objective of this PhD is to better know and better quantify the effects of aircraft noise exposure on sleep quality in populations living near airports in France, while distinguishing subjective quality and objective quality. Methods: In order to meet the objectives of the PhD, we used the data collected in an epidemiological research program called DEBATS (Discussion on the Health Effects of Aircraft Noise). The main study, also called the “longitudinal study”, included 1,244 participants living near three French major airports: Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Lyon-Saint-Exupéry and Toulouse-Blagnac. The subjective quality of sleep was assessed using a questionnaire administered by interviewers at the place of residence of the participants. Aircraft noise levels were estimated at each participant's home address using noise maps produced by the French Civil Aviation Authority. A complementary, also called the “sleep study” allowed us to estimate the objective sleep quality of 112 of the 1,244 participants in the longitudinal study. These 112 participants have worn a wrist actigraph for eight nights and an Actiheart (heart rate recorder) for one night. Acoustic measurements were made during these eight days and nights, both inside the participants’ bedrooms and outside (at the exterior façade) in order to characterize their aircraft noise exposure using not only energy indicators (LAeq, LA90) but also events indicators (number of events and maximum level of an noise event or LAmax). Results: The “longitudinaly study” analysis showed an association between aircraft noise exposure during the night (Lnight) and the subjective quality of sleep characterized by a risk of reporting to sleep less than 6 hours per night (OR=1.63 for 10 dB(A); 95% CI: 1.15–2.32) and a risk of feeling tired while awakening in the morning (OR=1.23 for 10 dB(A); 95% CI: 1.00– 1.54). We did not find any significant relationship with the other subjective parameters of sleep quality reported by the subjects themselves, such as time to fall asleep, nocturnal awakenings, sleep satisfaction, and sleep medication intake. We also showed an association between aircraft noise exposure and the objective parameters of sleep quality with an increase in time of sleep onset and duration of wake after sleep onset, and a reduction in sleep efficiency. Aircraft noise exposure also increased total sleep time and time in bed (this could be a matter of behavioral adaption to sleep deprivation). The energy indicators, but more still events indicators, were significantly associated with the objective parameters of sleep quality. For example, aircraft noise events detected inside the bedroom were associated with an increase in total duration of wake after sleep onset greater than 30 minutes (OR=1.10 for 10 events; 95% CI: 1.03-1.16). Finally, we observed a significant increase in amplitude of heart rate during a noise event associated with the passage of an aircraft and the maximum noise level of this event (LAmax). Conclusions: These results, mostly similar to those obtained in the majority of studies in the international literature, confirm that exposure to aircraft noise can decrease both subjective and objective quality of sleep. They also contribute to support the hypothesis that acoustic events indicators could, better than energy indicators more widely used, characterize the effects of aircraft noise on sleep"
"Inhumane Administrative Practices (IAP) refer to certain systematic, calculated and planned violent exercises on the part of management, by which the termination of contracts with workers who are considered to be replaceable or are disruptive to the instrumental ends of an organization are possible. The theoretical perspective of IAP presented here examines and details strategies, actions, omissions and other administrative acts through which workers are mistreated, humiliated and shamed, so that they passively submit to productive dynamics, reject the possibility to join unions, accept “voluntary work arrangements”, or quit their labor affiliation. IAP is characterized, therefore, by the use of intimidation and degrading methods that injure the humanity of workers in the context of a production logic centered on the laws of the market and maximization of profits. IAP in organizations does not go against the essential condition of human behavior; therefore, it is not carried out from a generalist perspective, but rather from the specificity of place and prescribed timeframes. For this reason the practices through which IAP violates workers' humanity are characterized at the local level. In this study, conceptual reference in humanities are applied and are fundamental to examine the relationship of labor subordination, which, while it is possible to eliminate, is a continually weakening factor because of an abuse of power that fails to recognize working people as individuals who are dignified, free, equal, autonomous, respectable and therefore, individuals who have the right to a good life.The creation of a theoretical framework, then, seeks to contribute to the epistemological foundation that provides new analytical elements to the science of management in order to focus concrete practices of workplace violence far from the philosophical perspective of a modern culture with ideological, legal and political foundations that recognize the human condition of every person. Ethnographic fieldwork was carried out in the organization C-Colombia between 1993-2005 and is presented in two accounts: one from the perspective of management and another from the perspective of workers. The result demonstrates that power and authority in this enterprise was always applied with disregard to psychological human suffering. This behavior is a product of mistreatment and humiliation of workers, and is incapable of applying alternative approaches to those of narcissistic and productionist ends, in order to resolve problems that could be dealt with technically and morally in a more dignified manner.Key words: Inhumanity, work, enterprise, inhumane administrative practices, workplace violence, humiliation, mistreatment, shame."
"The aim of the thesis is to analyze to what extent Economic Vulnerability, defined by Guillaumont, affects Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). More precisely, various papers in the thesis follow the current logic. First, It is important to unveil the relationship between various components of economic vulnerability affecting the level of FDI. Second, our analysis focus on how investment treaties modify the link FDI-Vulnerability. Third, focus on the close link between FDI and Official Development Assistance. Finally, We assess a larger spectrum by taking into account how uncertainty resulting from economic policy could affect macroeconomic aggregates."
"This thesis evaluates the economic impact of quality-related-to-origin policies using evaluation methods adapted to the specificity of such certifications, in particular, the spatial dimension. First, we analyze the effect of a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) adoption on price and production costs of PDO milk producers in Franche-Comté using a Geographic Regression Discontinuity (GRD) design. Secondly, we use propensity matching methods to analyze regional heterogeneity in Auvergne, Rhône-Alpes, and Franche-Comté before focusing on the effect of the PDO adoption at a national level. Finally, we evaluate the effect of the adoption of a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) on prices paid to Colombian coffee producers using synthetic control methods. Overall, we find that PDO and/or PGI adoption is associated with positive effects on farmers' economic performances. However, these effects are not homogeneously distributed."
"In the perspective of the third Sustainable Development Goal (""Good Health and Well-being""), it is necessary to increase financial resources for health in low income countries, but also to ensure that those resources are optimally allocated. To this purpose, efficiency measures appear as a useful tool to assess the performance of healh systems at the macroeconomic level, or of health facilities as the microeconomic level to get ""more health for the money"" (WHO,2010). Through its four chapters, this thesis provides some empirical evidence to the assessment of the efficiency of health system.The first chapter is a methodological review of nonparametric efficiency measures, used in the three empirical studies that follow. The second chapter assesses the efficiency of a sample of 120 low and middle income countries over the 1997/2014 period. Production function is defined as health expenditures producing health outcomes (maternal and juvenile survival). It concludes that, for the same health outcomes, countries could spend more than 20\% for the same health outcomes, and that inefficiency increases with the level of development of coutries. The last two chapters are case studies. The third one focuses on Township Health Centers in Weifang, Shandong province, China, relying on survey data. It highlights the potential for performance improvement and the role of demand side determinants and of the share of subsidies in incomes to explain efficiency scores. The fourth chapter deals with the efficiency of primary healthcare facilities in Ulan-Bator, Mongolia. It concludes that efficiency could be spurred by about 30\%. Demand side factors are positively associated to efficiency, but low levels of staff remuneration, as well as a suboptimal balance between medical and non-medical staff seem to hinder activity and efficiency of health facilities."
"In the globalized world, Nowhere, Place, is directly competing against Powerful, World, to attract residents, tourists and talent, as well as firms and investments, whether the place is a meta-region, a country, a region, a city or other locations. Whilst places and destinations around the world have been proclaiming their qualities for a long time, mainly to create awareness or maintain preference, those marketing communications campaigns are short-term and don’t contribute to unifying the place. To compete in such cutthroat environments, public authorities and place agencies have started to recognize the value of adopting branding techniques by way of practising place branding. Place branding adapts several tools developed in the field of commercial branding to contribute to place development and establish image-building strategies that render places more attractive to identified markets. As such, this doctoral work endeavours to adapt mainstream marketing concepts to the context of place branding, taking into account the views of three groups of stakeholders to enhance place brand efficiency. I address these research questions in a French region-branding context, according to three sub-questions that summarise the chapters of this thesis. First, what is the advertising legitimacy of a place brand as perceived by the residents? Does it influence place-branding efficiency? Second, to what extent do place brand managers use community marketing strategies to operationalize the integrated marketing communications (IMC) role of the place brand? Third, to what extent does the region brand image constitute a relevant vehicle for promoting a destination integral to the nation brand image, as perceived by international tourists? Results show that the representational and functional dimensions of a destination brand impact differently implicit attractiveness and intentions to visit. International tourists also perceive the region and the nation brand images as congruent overall, which contributes positively to their intentions to visit the region. From a theoretical point of view, this research highlights the importance of adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to understanding place branding. Doing so contributes to the development of empirical evidence in the domain, by studying the understudied region branding form. This dissertation also highlights similarities with commercial branding and reinforces the external validity of three classic marketing concepts. The methodological implications of this work come from the different methodological approaches (i.e. measurement tools and methods), developed to meet the specificities and stakes associated with the main stakeholders of a place brand. In addition, this approach reinforces the internal validity of the present research and contributes to ruling out the existence of a declarative bias. The managerial contributions of this thesis are connected with the methodological implications, inasmuch as it provides place brand managers with diverse analysis grids that will enable them to take into account the specificities and stakes associated with the main stakeholders of the place brand, and also involve stakeholders in the place-branding process. Finally, I demonstrate the need for an IMC approach that is per se—for example, through the use of an overall brand positioning that covers shared elements between stakeholders so that they all relate to the place brand, or through the adoption of a bottom-up rather than top-down approach to place branding. This approach also should be able to extend to other place scales, by leveraging the image of a higher-order place."
"When we mention international relations, we generally talk about diplomacy and investment, but there are other ways of promoting the interests of a government on the international stage. Sport can be used as tool to improve diplomacy between countries, as well as developing economic and social interests. Additionally, sport takes an important place in shaping the image of a nation, while it improves the integration process of young generations into the world. One of the main interests, from a government perspective, in the use of sport, is to generate a positive emotional connection to a host nation - what is known as soft power. The aim of this work is to explore some of the ways in which sport is used to generate this power, and how it can provide a type of control or influence. Specifically, it will focus on the State of Qatar. This work is separated to three main parts. First I present the development of sport and the way sport events were used by different countries and political regimes, and the impact generated. Second, I try to understand the impact generated from Qatar investment in the French football team Paris Saint-Germain. And third, I measured the socio-psychological impact generated on the young generation from hosting international sport events, as in the case of the Handball World championship 2015.This work sets to clarify how allowing such investment is perceived as an opportunity for development within the society, and to improve diplomacy. Additionally, focussing on the young generation allows me to study the evolution of how sport is an important tool in the process of socialization of young people into global society. Based on my research, I argue that the result of the Paris Saint-Germain investment was a ""win-win"" situation between France and Qatar on the social, economic, and political level. Also, using sport events generated positive emotional impact, making the residents admire the vision of the government. The young generation, regardless nationality has a positive view of government efforts to improve and develop itself - the Qatari government's vision was salient to the young generation in Qatar."
"This thesis is interested in public policy choices of local governments of the low-level jurisdictions, such as municipalities which face a high degree of mobility of capital, residents and workers. The tax competition literature did not pay enough attention to this strong mobility of the agents. Household mobility is most often ignored in the literature and there exists no model including capital, residents' and workers' mobility. By assuming immobility of households (either residents or workers or both), previous work depicts more a regional or national environment than a local one.This thesis addresses the following question: within metropolitan areas, how do competing local governments, facing a high mobility of capital, residents and workers, choose their various policy instruments? Theoretically, our thesis contributes to fill the gap in the literature mentioned above. It also matters from an empirical perspective. Indeed, fiscal, socio-demographic, economic and political data at the municipal level are among the most accessible ones.Our thesis can help to provide better theoretical grounds for future empirical work and pave the way for new approaches in the study of local governments' choices where agents' mobility plays a central role."
"This thesis explores the forms of commitment and provides an answer to the question: What is becoming of the normative contract of chartered accountants in a context of change of their profession? We crossed two theoretical fields: that of the organizational behavior with the theory of the psychological contract and the sociology of the professions with the integrated model of De Rozario (2006). We conducted 20 qualitative interviews with chartered accountants and mobilized an analysis grid based on the psychological contract theory that takes into account human and non-human contract makers. The results allow us to say that despite the current contractual violations and transitions, the profession of liberal accountants continues to lead to a commitment through its normative contract. The latter comprises three individual psychological contracts which are transactional, transitional and relational contracts. Current changes are leading to increasingly complex transactional psychological contracts with networks of experts and a relational psychological contract with management tools, especially digital devices, to respond to the crisis they face. Finally, the relational contract with the profession reduces today to its diploma component, moving towards relational contracts of expert networks of proximity."
"This thesis aims to analyze how the stratified nature of a society translates into horizontal inequalities in the labor market. We analyze the case of urban India, where disparities among gender, religion and caste groups persist despite the country’s significant structural change. The first chapter analyzes the links between labor market exclusion and group disadvantage. After estimating the likelihood of non-participation in the labor market, we address the specific case of secluded labor by detecting its impact on children’s education. We suggest that female labor market participation is not likely to lower the educational gap for future generations. The second chapter compares the paths of labor market mobility between 2005 and 2011-12 among gender and socio-religious groups. A detailed analysis of occupational and earnings mobility, followed by the estimation of their determinants, suggest that the group-specific mobility patterns may not reflect a process of “catching-up.” The third chapter proposes an analysis of labor market segmentation in the context of a predominantly informal labor market, showing that the household business sector is relatively homogenous and that the salaried sector is segmented along gender lines. A fourth chapter highlights the issue of potential discrimination by comparing parametric and semi-parametric wage gap decompositions, both suggesting that wage gaps are mostly due to selection and segregation effects in the case of gender. In the case of socio-religious groups, a combination of endowment differentials, nepotism and potential discrimination leads to substantial wage differentials."
"Deeply embedded in our daily lives, digital technology appears as an essential component of our era. In our mind, this phenomenon is largely addressed by marketing research but remains affected by several limits. On the one hand, we notice that most researches focus on a specific technology. This results in a partial approach of practice’s digital shift. On the other hand, we argue that researches approaching digital shift in a larger scope fail to give social thickness to the use of technology. With this in mind, we adhere to the principles of « sociologie des usages » theoretical framework to enlighten the integration of digital devices into shopping practices. In order to face theoretical challenges related to the practice’s digital shift we introduce the concept of digimorphosis in marketing research. Given the diversity of shopping practices, we propose an application of the concept to grocery shopping. In order to position ourselves as close as shoppers, we opt for a qualitative methodological positioning. Here as well, the challenges related to the digital shift require reconsidering the techniques traditionally used to collect data, bring new ones and combines them to enrich our understanding of shopper’s behavior in a connected world. Our analysis leads to the identification of a three axes analytical framework designed to appreciate the digimorphosis of shopping practices: (1) the community axe which address shopping as a collective practice; (2) the spatio-temporal axe which address shopping as a situated practice; (3) the mercantile axe which address shopping as a practice based on value creation."
"This thesis studies local crude oil transportation systems with a pipe network architecture. Two representative systems, belonging to PDVSA (Venezuelan oil company), have been studied: the Guaraguao Crude Oil Seaport and the Punta de Palmas Tanks Yard. In this systems, connections, called ""alignments"", are established by opening/closing valves using a SCADA(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system. Alignment choice is made based on optimization criteria. Interferences minimization with other alignments, related to the notion of operative capacity, has been identified as the most important criterion. The contributions of this thesis are based on graph modelling and algorithms from operational research. The main goal is to provide analysis tools allowing alignment choice optimization. Indexes permitting the quantification of alignments or failures impact on the operative capacity of the system are proposed. Minimizing the impact on the operative capacity will correspond to minimizing interferences with potential alignments. An algorithm computing these indexes is presented, as well as complementary developments such as a path search algorithm, an algorithm for critical elements determination, and algorithm for alignments using pumps. These algorithms are based on classical algorithms for the shortest path problem, the maximum flow problem and the maximum disjoint paths problem. However, they use innovative methods such as adding constraints when considering alignment sub-types, the dynamic computation of path costs based on their impact on operative capacity, and path search considering an obligatory intermediate node. These contributions can potentially be applied in areas other than oil transportation. The algorithms had been implemented in Python and had been tested using real data from the studied systems. The middle term goal of these works is the development of assistance software for decision making."
"Interoperability between enterprise applications is a multifaceted problem. In response, we have investigated the semantic alignment of business process and object knowledge supported by enterprise applications. This knowledge is heterogeneous across business and is implemented in different ways, generating semantic conflicts due to different interpretations of the actors. We study the identification of correspondences and/or conflicts between semantic knowledge, especially in the field of Manufacturing Execution System (MES). We propose an approach to formalize knowledge as a standardized repository ISO 62264 compliant: the ""MES repository"", and an approach to enhance the MES repository by successive alignments with other standards and/or repositories. Thus, we formally define a meta-model that describes the semantic relationships between elements of the aligned repositories, and semantic control rules to keep MES repository consistency and its ISO compliance. Finally, we present an approach to align  customer needs with the MES repository, in order to assist the implementation of enterprise applications. This PhD thesis was conducted as part of a research and development project supported by the economic Cluster Edit (Rhône-Alpes, France), and its results have been used in the new proposal “on demand MES”."
"We address the problem of supply chain management in the context of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). We propose an integrated approach allowing the operationalization of the economic, environmental and social performances at the strategic, tactical and operational decision levels of the supply chain. In particular, we apply our approach to the strategic and tactical levels, for the problem of sustainable insourcing/outsourcing of the activities of the value chain on the one hand (strategic decision), and for the problem of the strategic-tactical planning of a sustainable supply chain on the other hand. In the former case, we combine value analysis with performance measurement using AHP method (Analytical Hierarchy Process), an aggregative multi-criteria technique. In the latter, we develop a multi-objective mathematical program that we apply to a realistic case inspired by the Canadian lumber industry. After solving the problem, we obtain a multitude of compromise solutions (Pareto optimums) presenting different performance levels following the economic, environmental and social dimensions, allowing the decision maker to choose the solution that reflects best his/her CSR strategy. This application illustrates the proposed method and allows us to assess the practical value of our approach."
"The development and application of inventory models for deteriorating items is one of the main concerns of the experts in the domain, since the number and variety of deteriorating products are dramatically increasing. One of the major gaps in the deteriorating inventories literature is that researchers have not paid enough attention to two important features in their models: i) Considering stochastic conditions; especially stochastic lead time is almost overlooked since makes the mathematical challenges complicated, ii) designing innovative inventory policies by taking into account the environmental issues and particularly the CO2 emission as a new objective in a multi-objective framework that is quite new. In this thesis, we study replenishment policy for deteriorating products under stochastic conditions in form of three different problem areas. In the first one, we develop a continuous (r,Q) inventory model for a retailer that offers a deteriorating product by considering infinite planning horizon, stochastic lead time, constant demand rate and backordered shortages. For modeling the deterioration process, a non-linear holding cost is defined. Taking into consideration the stochastic lead time as well as a non-linear holding cost makes the mathematical model more complex. We therefore customize the proposed model for a uniform distribution function that could be tractable to solve optimally by an exact approach. In second problem, we study the strategy of pooling lead time risks by splitting replenishment orders among multiple suppliers simultaneously for a retailer that sells a deteriorating product. Finally, in the last problem, we consider inventory and transportation costs, as well as the environmental impacts in a centralized supply chain by taking into account uncertain demand and partial backordered shortages. In order to deal with demand uncertainty, a two stage stochastic programming approach is taken. Then, by considering transportation vehicles capacity, we develop a mixed integer mathematical model. In this way, the best transportation vehicles and replenishment policy are determined by finding a balance between financial and environmental criteria. A numerical example from the real world is also presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model."
"The aim of this PhD research is to study the impact of the inventory inaccuracy issue on replenishment policies under the wholesaling / e-retailing context. The inventory inaccuracy is defined as a discrepancy between the quantity shown by the Informational System and the quantity actually Physically available for sales. Such discrepancy has as root many sources of errors such as execution, transaction, misplacement, supply unreliability or shrinkage errors. We provide empirical evidence on the wide presence of inventory inaccuracies through one case study of wholesaling organizations. In e-retailing context customers’ demands are remotely satisfied based on the inventory level shown in the information system. The main interest of the research community was about studying the inaccuracy under the retail context. After motivating our research empirically and by the literature review, we develop three inventory frameworks subject to inventory inaccuracies under the wholesaling / e-retailing context with different configurations of the stochastic errors describing the inaccuracy issue. The error configuration could be additive for some sources of inaccuracies such as transaction as well as multiplicative (also known as stochastically proportional) for other sources such as shrinkage. Our first inventory framework aims to extend single-period (Newsvendor) model to the e-retailing/wholesaling context subject to inaccuracy. In Addition, to providing managerial insights, we compare the behavior of the optimal ordering strategies under the additive and the multiplicative error settings. Our second inventory framework is an extension of the former to the case of two selling periods. By solving exactly the two-period problem, we show that the behavior of the optimal ordering quantities is not monotonic, and conclude that a myopic policy could not be optimal. Thanks to a numerical study, we derive some interesting managerial insights about the management of the error risk between the two selling periods. Thanks to the theoretical results of our second inventory framework, we propose a third framework dealing with the inventory inaccuracy issue under a multi-period setting by assuming cost minimizing as a target but also by considering two Cycle Service Level constraints to achieve, the former for the demand satisfaction and the latter for the sales commitment satisfaction. We provide a comprehensive numerical study by comparing several policies as making inspection and RFID deployment."
"This work is composed by three chapters, two of them deal with education and public education policies related to crime, one focuses on the relationship between education and birth spacing and fertility. In the first chapter I study the mechanisms at play between education and crime when the government introduces a policy to increase the access to education and whether choosing the right policy design we are able to reduce crime despite the raise in the aggregate wealth generated by human capital growth. In the second chapter I analyse the dynamic relation between education access, education quality and crime deterrence technology, to characterize the conditions under which crime drops and the implied role of education. The third chapter is an empirical study of the relationship between education and fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa, between economics and demography. Even if the topic and the methods of the first two papers differ a lot from the third one, they are all related by the interest to understand better the role of education in economic growth. Both crime and violence and high fertility rates and population growth, for diverse reasons and through peculiar dynamics, undermine economic investment and growth potential. The goal of this thesis is therefore to give a contribution to understand these reasons and these dynamics, with special attention to developing countries where free access to education is a recent achievement and where there is still work to do to improve the quality of the education system and teaching."
"This thesis focuses on the integration of interactions in the estimation of the public policy’s effect. Indeed, the estimation standard methods usually rely on strong assumptions that exclude partially or completely the interaction effect both in the selection process of beneficiaries and in the performance of the policy. However, the validity of these assumptions is questionable, particularly in the context of a non-experimental policy because an individual according as it is the beneficiary or not the policy, is not isolated: he interacts with his neighborhood. Thus, the estimated effect of the policy by traditional methods is likely to be biased (underestimation or overestimation) therefore induce decision-making based on erroneous conclusions. Therefore, in this thesis, we assume that the treatment received by an individual can affect other individuals in his neighborhood through different diffusion mechanisms. Using spatial econometric methods, we propose a methodological framework to take into account both in selection process and in the outcomes the interactions in the estimation of the policy effect. Four extensions of the evaluation methods are developed with an empirical study for each method."
"Strategic partnerships between NGOs and businesses are still little studied in the French context, but their importance is more and more strong, both empirically and theoretical. The objective of this research is to better understand these very special relations between two organizations whose objectives are a priori quite distant. One of the common interests between NGOs and businesses is the social responsibility of the company (CSR). Indeed, CSR, beyond even the definitions proposed in the literature, all questions taking account of the expectations of the stakeholders of the company, and the ability of companies to take account of these stakeholders, and to their account. This approach is most prevalent and is referred to as 'firmo-centric’. Here we have chosen a different approach which is ‘NGO-centric’. It appeared to us as a new way of approaching the NGO reports - company, which is part of the prospect of a 'open CSR' which we support in this work.CSR can be regarded as a vector that allows NGOs to reach businesses and to influence their positioning, their strategies. Thus, we establish our problematic: how partnerships with NGOs can influence the social responsibility of the company?To respond, we adopt a qualitative research approach, multi case and comparative. We have followed two distinct phases: eleven exploratory cases, and three cases in depth. We follow abductive approach, with several back and forth between the field and the theoretical constructs selected.The main argument in this doctoral work is to support the strategic partnership allows NGOs to contribute to the construction of companies’ social responsibility strategies. It is even a key leverage of this construction. However, this strategic leverage depends on different variables (or requirements). Some have already been identified in the literature, some not. We thus highlight new variables and offer an enrichment of literature. This enrichment takes the form of a classification of variables or prerequisites identified by literature, supplemented by the new identified variables. The comprehensive study of cases can also offer two complementary models of strategic partnerships NGOs - Companies, a comprehensive (with leverages and restraints) and the other dynamic (in four phases). These models illustrate our approach referred to as ‘open CSR’: the importance of the NGO in the definition of companies’ social responsibility strategies, as well as the dynamic character of the NGO-business partnerships, are considered together. We show that the strategic partnership NGO - Company enabling NGOs to co-build companies’ social responsibility strategies when the dynamics of the process is complete (four phases)."
"The electricity high voltage transmission networks are interconnected over most of the continents but this is not the case of the power system organizations. Indeed, as described with the concept of integrated power system, the organization over these large networks is divided by several kinds of internal borders. In this context, the research object, the cross-border coordination of operation, is a set of coordination arrangements over internal borders between differing regulatory, technical and market designs. These arrangements can include for instance the famous market couplings, some cost-sharing agreements or common security assessments among several other solutions. The existence and improvement of the cross-border coordination of operation can be beneficial to the whole integrated power system. This statement is verified in the European case as in 2012 where several regional and continental coordination arrangements are successfully implemented.In order to benefit from the European experience and contribute to support the European improvement process, this thesis investigates the cross-border coordination of operation in the European case with four angles of study. First, a modular framework is built to describe the existing solutions and the implementation choices from a regulatory point of view. Second, the thesis analyses the tools available to assess the impact of an evolution of the cross-border coordination. Third, the role of the European Union (EU) is described as critical both for the existing arrangements and to support the improvement process. The last angle of study focuses on two dimensions of the economic modes of coordination between transmission system operators."
"The growing demand for food, energy and natural resources, combined with the limited stock of natural resources available and the process of trade liberalization are among the factors that have triggered a new rush for land observed in the last years. Despite an extensive literature, most analyses of large scale land based investment are politically and ideologically anchored, reflecting strong opposing stances. On one hand, some have expressed some concerns on the potential implications of these projects on peasants’ land rights and livelihood. On the other hand, some other researchers have argued that these projects should be seen as opportunities in the struggle for food security and rural development. This thesis questions the economic, social and institutional complexity of large scale land based investment including their differentiated evolutionary dynamics and implications in terms of agricultural development and agrarian change in Mozambique. Because of a high failure rate and difficulties to establish the production structures, it appears that large scale land based investments haven’t led to a shift from small scale farming to large scale farming as the main farming organization in Mozambique. However, the rising interest of foreign investors tend to influence national authorities in rehabilitating the post-Independence agricultural development model, which was characterized by a dual system composed of marginalized subsistence farmers on one hand and foreign owned large scale farms. So, not only do smallholders benefit little from present agricultural investment dynamics, but also agricultural policies and support measures tend to shift away from the former towards the facilitation of large-scale investment. Our results questions the capacity of actual large scale land based investments to trigger a trajectory of agricultural development able to meet African economies challenges."
"In the context of the demo-economic transition in Sub-Saharan Africa, changes in rural household strategies towards more complex livelihoods, together with the recognition of renewed forms of migration, raise issues around the restructuring of rural economies. This thesis questions the renewed role of Mozambican rural households’ mobilities to understand to what extent they represent a key factor with regards the reshaping of livelihoods in the present post-Apartheid and liberalization context.This work sheds light on the conceptual links between institutional approaches in economics and the notion of circulation in geography in order to analyze the role of mobilities in livelihoods’ strategies in the long term. The analytical approach is based on biographical surveys of 97 Mozambican rural households, and includes both quantitative and qualitative methods.  The analysis shows the evolution of intense and circular migration of Leonzoane families to South Africa during colonial times towards more complex forms of mobilities, with a higher degree of working flexibility, in more extended geographical areas within and beyond the historical mining sector. These mobilities rely on a diversity of arrangements embedded in networks, showing evidence of a migration contract in the making, based on household strategies’ circular resources. The analysis of these migration forms together with the reshaping of households’ livelihoods illustrates a highly diversified situation in Leonzoane. While some households show a growing complexity of adjustments of their livelihoods, in which the relative share of agricultural activities tends to decrease, others perpetuate very stable non-diversified livelihoods. Being a fundamental livelihood asset, migration can certainly act as a strategic resource for rural households, but can also be a factor of insecurity or dependency."
"This thesis centres on issues of economic efficiency originating from the large-scale development of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES) in Europe. The flexible resources that are necessary to cope with their specificities (variability, low-predictability, site specificity) are already known, but adequate signals are required to foster efficient operation and investment in these resources. A first question is to what extent intermittent RES can remain out of the market at times when they are the main driver of investment and operation in power systems. A second question is whether the current market design is adapted to their specificities. These two questions are tackled in four distinct contributions.The first chapter is a critical literature review. This analysis introduces and confronts two (often implicit) paradigms for RES integration. It then identifies and discusses a set of evolutions required to develop a market design adapted to the large-scale development of RES, such as new definitions of the products exchanged and reorganisation of the sequence of electricity markets.In the second chapter, an analytical model is used to assess the potential of intraday markets as a flexibility provider to intermittent RES with low production predictability. This study highlights and demonstrates how the potential of intraday markets is heavily dependent on the evolution of the forecast errors.The third chapter focuses on the benefits of curtailing the production by intermittent RES, as a tool to smooth out their variability and reduce overall generation costs. Another analytical model is employed to anatomize the relationship between these benefits and a set of pivotal parameters. Special attention is also paid to the allocation of these benefits between the different stakeholders.In the fourth chapter, a numerical simulation is used to evaluate the ability of the European transmission system operators to tackle the investment wave required in order to manage the production of intermittent RES. Alternative financing strategies are then assessed. The findings reveal that under the current trend of tariffs, the volumes of investment forecasted will be highly challenging for transmission system operators."
"An established stream of literature in institutional tradition suggests that as institutional change process unfolds in the field, dominant institutional logic shifts. The implications of such shifts in institutional logic for the broader network of relationships of various constituents are still not clear. This thesis, therefore, aims to uncover the dynamics of firm-stakeholders relationships in a field undergoing a robust institutional change process. In order to understand these evolving relationships in emerging country’s context, Mitchell et al.’s (1997) framework of stakeholder salience has been employed as an underlying theoretical framework. This thesis also makes several conceptual and empirical contributions to this framework and strengthens its theoretical underpinnings. Overall, using data collected through semi-structured interviews and archival material, this dissertation suggests strong dominant institutional logic-stakeholder salience relationship. Moreover, this thesis provides several lessons for managers and researchers that may help to better set firms’ strategic direction."

"The neoclassical theory developed historically around the concept of equilibrium (partial or general), by assuming its long run stability and independence from monetary and real fluctuations. The growing emphasis on path-dependence and, particularly, on the concept of hysteresis calls into question the traditional method, by rejecting the theoretical validity of the neoclassical equilibrium and its related properties of stability. This thesis focuses on the model of “genuine” hysteresis, which first developed in the field of physics and recently extended its application to economic phenomena. Far from suggesting an appropriation of the methods that are typical of “hard” sciences, the aim is to analyse the consequences of discontinuous and hysteretic investment decisions on business cycles and long run trajectories. By relying on the Post Keynesian theory of growth and distribution, and the multi-agent methodological approach, this thesis develops a macroeconomic theoretical model that is able to generate non-linear business cycles around transitory equilibria, which are fully endogenous and historically determined according to the specific adjustment path. This theoretical framework confirms and reinforces the traditional Post Keynesian implications of income inequalities on the degree of utilization of productive capacity and on long run growth. Moreover, expansionary demand policies regain a central role in driving the economy towards the full employment of productive resources."
"The focus of this research is to study the characteristics of flexibility in order to help building more flexible IS. The objective is to achieve flexibility in the IS in order to adapt them swiftly for facing changes, and be able to adjust for new strategies. The main questioned posed is: How can IS flexibility be achieved?. This constitutes the research question. This research extends previous studies related to flexibility by focusing on the various dimensions of Information Systems. To cover all the aspects of an IS the problem of enabling an IS with flexibility will be approached, in this research, by analyzing the relevant elements in an Information System. This research will try to identify what IS flexibility is in the people, process, IT, and data dimensions; and how IS flexibility can be achieved. The conclusion that can be drawn is that the flexibility enablers needed for an Information System are contingent upon its unique characteristics. The findings of both case studies show that the elements that sustain flexibility are not the same for every IS; they depend on certain characteristics of the specific IS. The fact that the elements or enablers needed to sustain flexibility are different can be explained by the polymorphic property of flexibility: for an IS, flexibility displays the same polymorphism characteristic found in strategic flexibility. The answer to the research question of how IS flexibility can be achieved, lies in the flexibility enablers needed for a specific IS. From a practical point of view this means that the managers involved in flexibility decisions or initiatives should understand that there are flexibility enablers in the resources of a firm that can be deployed or acquire. Then, they should become familiar and understand them. But in order to really enable a particular IS with the correct set of flexibility enablers (or the correct form of flexibility needed) it is very important that these enablers be selected according to the unique characteristics of the IS in hand. The conceptual IS flexibility framework developed in this research and the findings presented as a result of two case studies (of two different flexible Information systems tightly linked to changing strategies) conducted, constitutes a valuable guide for managers to deploy flexible IS to rapidly adapt them when faced to changes needed for strategies implementation in a continuous manner."
"Currently deployed optical transmission systems use coherent detection for data rates of 40 Gb/s and 100 Gb/s. Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation using four phase levels in combination with polarization division multiplexing (PDM) allows transmitting four bits per symbol. The use of more complex modulation formats, such as 16 level quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) allows increasing the data rate. However, this method reduces dramatically the transmission reach. For example, when passing from 100 Gb/s PDM-QPSK to 200 Gb/s PDM-16QAM, the reach is reduced by a factor of five. A new and disruptive approach in order to increase the capacity is mode division multiplexing (MDM), and this approach is investigated in the frame of my thesis. I start my thesis with some generalities on optical transmission systems followed by a presentation of their historical evolution against the background of the increasing capacity demand in the worldwide telecommunication networks. Afterwards I show some ways to continue the capacity growth in optical transmission systems before focusing on MDM. I describe the new key elements, notably the few-mode fiber and the few-mode amplifier, the mode-multiplexer / -demultiplexer and the new receiver system. I finish with a presentation of some experiments using entire MDM systems, which allowed us to be among the first research teams worldwide to realize a successful MDM transmission"
"Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is an emerging technology that is gaining importance among traditional wireless communication systems. However, WMNs are particularly vulnerable to external and insider attacks due to their inherent attributes such as open communication medium and decentralized architecture. In this research, we propose a complete distributed and cooperative intrusion detection system for efficient and effective detection of WMN attacks in real-time. Our intrusion detection mechanism is based on reliable exchange of network events and active cooperation between the participating nodes. In our distributed approach, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are independently placed at each mesh node to passively monitor the node routing behavior and concurrently monitor the neighborhood behavior. Based on that, we first implement a Routing Protocol Analyzer (RPA) that accuracy generates Routing Events from the observed traffic, which are then processed by the own node and exchanged between neighboring nodes. Second, we propose a practical Distributed Intrusion Detection Engine (DIDE) component, which periodically calculates accurate Misbehaving Metrics by making use of the generated Routing Events and pre-defined Routing Constraints that are extracted from the protocol behavior. Third, we propose a Cooperative Consensus Mechanism (CCM), which is triggered among the neighboring nodes if any malicious behavior is detected. The CCM module analyzes the Misbehaving Metrics and shares Intrusion Detection Results among the neighbors to track down the source of intrusion. To validate our research, we implemented the distributed intrusion detection solution using a virtualized mesh network platform composed of virtual machines (VMs) interconnected. We also implemented several routing attacks to evaluate the performance of the intrusion detection mechanisms"
"The present study intends to provide further clarity on interorganizational relationships within the car retail business in France. The analysis of the economic and legal frame aims at defining the current business environment and stress out the importance of the various outside forces that may influence the market players. A thorough review of the related literature, focusing on organization theory and marketing channel theory, highlights the different variables, either economic or customer behavior related , that impact the business relationships. This approach will be completed by a resource-based analysis. The overall study contributes to draw a complete picture of interdependencies between car makers and car dealers.The qualitative approach is based on a series of sixty-five interviews that have been transcribed in their entirety in order to provide material to this content. As a first outcome of the analysis, the study points out the key role played by power in the interactions between firms. In a second step, the analysis demonstrates how the entrenchment strategy embraced by car makers has enabled them to establish their dominance by reshaping the legal frame of the business interactions, and how it has permitted them to strengthen their negotiation power by becoming the driving force of the resources allocation process followed by the distributors. In a final section, the study shows how the current business model may evolve as new perspectives related to retail network concentration may open."
"Enterprises face difficult conditions related to the pace of the observed changes at the beginning of XXIst century and are struggling to raise employee commitment. The purpose of this research was to invest new managerial thoughts by questioning the contribution of spirituality at work to the affective commitment of employees. To verify the existence of this link, a case study “Sodexo Tunisia” was conducted through semi-structured interviews. These interviews have been twice analyzed, statistically using the Alceste software and qualitatively through a thematic content analysis. It was concluded, on one side, that basic forms of the affective commitment of employees, namely their emotional attachment, their desire to stay and make special efforts, are favored by the spiritual dimension “spirit of survival” related to the presence and the “shared values” of the enterprise. On the other side, correlated forms of affective commitment interpreted as “psychological identification to the job” and ""psychological identification to the group” are associated with the spiritual dimensions “self-government” and “inner life” for the former, and “esprit de corps” for the latter. In a managerial perspective, these spiritual dimensions favor the recognition of individuals (stimulus to potential and intellectual capital), the development of “esprit de corps” (glue of lasting commitment) and help maintain the “spirit of survival” of the enterprise (basis of the emotional attachment of employees). This “mind-state” provides an enterprise model with a resilience capacity, due to the consistency between the parts and the whole."
"Fishing, an ancestral activity, contributes to the livelihoods of 10 to 12% of the world's population. Artisanal fisheries generate more than half of the world's catches and provide 90% of the corresponding jobs. In Mexico, it provides employment to over 350,000 fishers, organized mainly in cooperatives. In Sinaloa, the location of the fieldwork, artisanal fisher’s cooperatives have gradually sunk into a crisis that threatens their survival. They are subject to mutually reinforcing endogenous and exogenous challenges. Public policies related to artisanal fisheries that favour the preservation of the environment do not contribute to lifting poverty out of coastal populations. The thesis hypothesizes that poverty exit requires public policies that rely on artisanal fisher's cooperatives and that integrate the three pillars of sustainable development : the environment, the economy and the human rights. On the basis of an in-depth and multidisciplinary case study, the research proposes tools and avenues for action based on an ad hoc model for strengthening cooperatives. In particular, it proposes a tool for diagnosing them, and the following conclusions have been reached : 1) their economic, social and environmental role justifies their perpetuity 2) this perpetuity is the responsibility of both, the cooperatives and other stakeholders 3) environmental public policies must not only integrate the economic and sociocultural dimensions of artisanal fisheries but must also establish legal means to ensure their effectiveness."
"Will managers and employees have to work until age 70? A similar scenario seems to be emerging with increasing the number of years needed to qualify for a full pension. In this context, managers in France aged 45 and older are encouraged to anticipate the second half of their career, in the form of an interview with their employer, and according to the National Inter-professional Agreement of October 13, 2005, updated by Law No. 2014-288 of March 5, 2014. The field study is based on 26 interviews conducted in 2013 in media agencies which are members of the trade union of UDECAM. This sector proves to be particularly sensitive to the development of digital technology, which generates a change in expectations towards managers’ role. The results were analyzed by means of two complementary methods. A lexical analysis, carried out with Alceste© software, highlights a social representation of a deterministic and traditional career model. Simultaneously, an analysis of cognitive maps with Decision Explorer© software shows that nearly three quarters of them feel cognitive dissonance when it comes to anticipating their careers. These results suggest the presence of a double bind between a demand for anticipating one’s career and the constrained nature of management by objectives. This diagnosis encourages the adoption of a strategic human resources management and a career interview both adapted to the complexity of the situation. They also raise questions about the projected societal model since the risk of poverty or “forced” work are amplified by the cognitive dissonance situation observed in the survey."
"Serious Games are computer games that are designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment and that can be used for teaching. Although they are relevant to many fields of education, their development remains very expensive and time consuming. In this thesis, we focus mainly on Learning Games (LGs), that is on Serious Games designed for educational purposes, and more specifically on LGs used for training students in engineering schools. The first part of the thesis is devoted to an analysis of the needs of those who create LGs and a state of the art in terms of methodologies and tools available. Our study shows the need to facilitate collaboration between the various actors, with complementary roles, involved in the development of a LG (domain expert, pedagogical expert, game designer ...). Our research also highlights the need for models and visual representations of the LG scenario to facilitate the design of LGs that are fun and attractive while still maintaining their educational values. To address the first need, we propose a global collaborative methodology for creating LGs in which we indentify the tasks assigned to each actor who is involved in the creation process and the tools available. To meet the second need identified by our preliminary study, we propose a LG scenario model that represents the educational structure chosen by the pedagogical expert and also the way this structure is integrated into a game scenario imagined by the game designer. To reify our proposals, we have developed an authoring environment called LEGADEE (LEarning Game DEsign Environment) that guides each designer with a ""toolbar"" adapted to his or her role and also provides a validation system that analyzes the ongoing creation. Lastly, we have designed an evaluation protocol to validate our authoring environment as well as the methodology and the models proposed during which we compare 24 LGs of which half were created with LEGADEE and half without. Our evaluation indicates that our tool tends to improve the quality of LGs at several levels. It also brings to light the limits of our work and provides guidance for future improvements of LEGADEE and the evaluation process itself."
"To meet the economic constraints (growth of mass customization demands, globalization and cost reducing), the development of new strategies forms as a “Just In Time” production strategy or “Lean Manufacturing” needs to reorganize the enterprise taking into account the activities which generates value (following the value-chain logic) in order to avoid wastefulness. This strategy leads to a business refocusing and a value-chain extension. The enterprise has to develop collaboration strategies (Bare and Cox, 2008 ; Davis, 1987) and has to have a Lean (just in time response) Information Systems (IS), agile IS to react fluctuations, open IS to support a partnership with suppliers, customers and partners and interoperable IS to make easier the communication between systems and business views. However, the enterprise IS contains multiple systems: ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), MES (Manufacturing Execution System), PLM (Product Life-cycle Management), SCM (Supply Chain Management)…Each system is designed to meet a particular business view, and is developed according to specific business requirementswithout any standardization which cause redundancy, heterogeneity and increase the volume of information including an inconsistency, a rigidity of the IS and a difficulty of inter-enterprise collaboration. To face theses disadvantages we have to define an agile and interoperable IS and to reorganize processes to support the enterprise value-chain. Therefore, we propose to develop a Lean ESB (Enterprise Service Bus) which is a Service Oriented Architecture middleware, improved by a business semantic layer. We defined four modules of Lean ESB:• The mediation module defines information exchange between a business layers and IS and insures other modules operating. • The dynamic choreography module enables industrial services composition to define processes in accordance with customer demands. • The intelligent routing module organizes workshop resources in order to reorganize processes in a pull flow strategy. • The monitoring and governance module enables the control of production performance and products quality."
"Changes in economic environment impose new organizational strategies to companies: refocusing business and creating collaboration strategies. These trends point to an exponential growth of service ecosystems accessible to both end users and partners. All foreshadows that these ecosystems rely heavily on service-oriented architectures that can build information systems having the required agility and supporting the interconnection of collaborative business processes by composing processes dynamically from distributed services. This type of architecture that ensures business and information systems alignment, makes it essential to take into account security constraints at the services’ and the composition’s levels.  In a distributed and dynamic services’ environment, security should not be limited to providing technological solutions but to find a security strategy taking into account the business, organizational and technological dimensions. Besides, the security must be considered as an ongoing process that aims to optimize security investments and ensures the sustainability of implemented security measures. However, the models and reference architectures in the services’ domain have underestimated the definition of security requirements, assets to protect and the identification of risks to those assets. Therefore, we propose to address the security management issues by a risk management approach to identify the different types of risks and propose the most appropriate security measures to the context. Nevertheless, risk management is a real challenge in an open collaborative services’ environment. The methods of risk management developed in the context of information systems do not meet the security requirements in an open environment and are not suitable for dynamic environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a methodological framework for security management covering the phases: preparation, design, execution and supervision of the services’ lifecycle. We propose a model of secure services to identify security patterns, an assets’ classification model and an ontology defining the concepts associated with those assets. Moreover, we develop a methodology for designing secure service oriented architectures, we address the development of secure business processes then we propose a security service for managing and supervising the infrastructure components’ vulnerabilities."
"Today, more North-South Joint-ventures are initiated mainly to the quest for greater competitive advantages that will lead to improve performance. Nevertheless, knowledge transfer in North-South Joint-ventures is not well known. This research proposes to explore the knowledge transfer in the context of joint-venture network. The result of the research shows that knowledge transfer in this context is affected by the parent and the joint-venture. The informal relationship between decider on this network is a facilitate factor of knowledge transfer. The findings are summarized determinants factors that affect knowledge transfer from foreign parent to joint-venture, local parent to joint-venture and from joint-venture to parents. Following factors : mutual trust, the performance of the joint-venture, the quality of the contributions, the bargaining power, strategic compatibility and cultural compatibility are determining factors in the three processes of transfer of knowledge. As much the parents which the joint-venture must have them in order to make a success of the transfer of knowledge."

"This thesis studies the mechanisms of stratification and inequalities in attainments. The main objective is to determine if the comprehensivization of education systems leads to higher levels of equality in achievements. On the one hand, a theoretical analysis is built upon the work of Epple and Romano (1998), Glomm and Ravikumar (1998), and Nechyba (1997, 2003) in order to assess the mechanisms of stratification and their impact on achievements. On the other hand, an empirical approach is elaborated in order to quantify this impact in the context of five education systems differentiated by their institutional characteristics. "
"Our works concern the appropriation process of the IAS/IFRS repository within organizations. They try to describe and to explain the meeting of the management tool made up by international standards with the organization, and the changes inferred from its adoption, keeping mainly three approaches: a rational perspective, a socio-political perspective and a psycho-cognitive perspective. In addition, to enrich our work and to allow to better apprehend our object of research, we in particular made loans with the néoinstitutional theory and the theory of the structuring. The exam of both longitudinal case studies reveals that the appropriation process can be split up into two periods: the first one corresponds to the introduction of the IAS/IFRS repository and contains the initiation, adoption and adaptation phases. The second period represents the tool implementation, marked by the acceptance, routinisation and integration phases. The description of this process tries to assist managers in thinking related to appropriation of a management tool, in the case of IAS/IFRS and to suggest proposals intended to support its social inscription"
"The pursuit of ethics as an objective obliges management to seek meansof improving it while, in articulating this process with the general objectives of the firm, including those ethics oriented to draw benefits. Our research reveals the difficulty, usually downplayed, to anticipate the influence of ethics on the players. It stresses that the explicit contradictions that characterize the different theoretical approaches of this field aren't expressed by processes clearly dissimilar. The first part of the study proposes a theoretical frame. In the literature, ethics is understood as an intermediate objective that determines economic success, and gives relevance to the managerial processes it implies. In an other antagonistic paradigm the ethics of the firm is necessarily a finality. Improving ethics means reducing the array of actions that can be accepted. Ethics is independent of economic success. The assumption that different strategies of firms lay on these two bases of logic constitutes the foundation of our field work. In this, we attempt to verify that these approaches are in power. The second part, empirical in nature, comprises two case studies. In the former, a company is studied as it is in the process of implementing a code of ethics following the acquisition of a competitor. Ethics is never wanted for itself but only for his alleged effects on the compatibility between actions of the members of the firm and, therefore, economical success. The latter consisted of an organization in the specific period wherein an ethical dilemma was identified. It appears that ethics drives actors to compose responses in situ and that the risk is the reduction of control that organizations exert on their members. "

"The public service organizations are particularly concerned with the intensive instrumentation management. To this end, the public management mobilizes tools from the private sector while dealing with organizations Weber.In 2008, the creation of a new agency, Pôle emploi, in charge of employment, resulting from the merger of a private organization (Assedic) and a public one (ANPE).After the merger, Pôle emploi faces numerous upheavals of identity, cultural and organizational order. They concern just as much the managerial line than the agents, at the same time pulled between the historic experiences of their institutions of origin and the new marks which forge this new public institution.The operational solution is translated by the instrumentation of its management around the Quality management system. Our case study deciphers the longitudinal trajectory of this management tool, brought to adapt itself to legitimize the philosophy administrator of performance whom it carries. We question the actors of a regional employment agency, plunged into a complex social game dominated by an organizational change and the administrator been imperative by the summit, under the pressure of a context of crisis and endemic unemployment.This study focus on two research questions. The first one bases on managerial actors' perception who control the Quality management system and on user actors who practice it. The second questions the strategies which develop the same actors, stemming from different professional groups. In a contextualiste and dynamic approach, our framework articulates around the theory of instruments, the theory of the social regulation and the new institutional theory. The stake bases on the conciliation of the cultures-job and managerial historically anchored to impose gradually a common culture among Pôle emploi employees."
"This thesis contains three empirical essays on housing markets and housing policies. In the first essay, we investigate the effects of rent control on rents using historical panel data in Lyon over a 78-year period. We use multiple regressions with fixed effects as the main form of analysis. Our results show that the causal effect of rent control on rents in Lyon is significantly negative. In the second essay, I study how age influences housing demand based on household level data from China. The two-stage hedonic house price model used in this essay allows me to estimate the pure age effect on housing demand, after housing quality and other household’s characteristics are controlled for. The results demonstrate that the willingness-to-pay for a constant-quality house will decrease slightly or keep constant when a representative household head becomes old, if the household head’s educational attainment is controlled for. In contrast, it will drop rapidly if the household head’s educational attainment is not controlled for. Therefore, this essay concludes that the total housing demand will not decrease with population aging, because the current middle- aged generation get educated more than the current old generation. Finally, in the third essay, in the framework of Rosen-Roback model, I analyze how housing costs affect the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled workers, explicitly the skill intensity ratio (SIR), across cities in China. To avoid endogeneity issues, I use both share of unavailable land and historical housing prices as instruments of current housing prices. The results show that average housing prices have significant positive effects on the SIR in 2010 when workers’ mobility is relaxed, but insignificant effects on the SIR in 2000 when workers’ mobility was tightly regulated."
"This thesis is composed of three chapters that have in common the question of export quality in a developing country context. The thesis focuses on different aspects of improving the quality level of exports. The first chapter is devoted to the impact of Aid for Trade on the quality of exports from recipient countries. It suggests a positive effect of Aid for Trade policy on the quality of exports. The second chapter focuses on the quality assurance role played by intermediaries in international trade. The results indicate that only specialized intermediaries play this role. The third chapter examines the link between firms' export orientation and their innovation performance. The empirical analysis shows a reduction in R&D investment by exporters whose sales reorient towards exports to the detriment of the domestic market, especially as they face high demand uncertainty. These unfavourable developments could nevertheless be overcome if the company has a long trade experience or high productivity. The three main results of this thesis are that aid for trade and the rise of specialized intermediaries contribute to the rise in quality of exporters, while the uncertainty of external demand tends, on the other hand, to hinder innovation by exporting firms."
"This study focuses on acoustic transduction in frequencies ranging from 100GHz to 1THz. A picosecond pulsed laser was used to generate and detect high frequency phonons. These transductors are a two-layers pileup of GaAs/AlAs gathered in one superlattice. The optical wave-length sensitivity was experimentally studied. To improve the transduction efficiency, an optical micro cavity was used to increase the interaction between radiation and superlattice. These light-to-sound transducers were used to measure subterahertz and terahertz phonons' lifetime. An anomaly in lifetime frequency dependence was observed in gallium arsenide. Dispersion relation from ab initio calculation coupled with Landau-Rumer phonon lifetime theory fully explain this unexpected anomaly. "
"The introduction of the Euro currency in 1999 represented a major event for the European economies. The 2007 financial crisis and the subsequent 2010 sovereign debt crisis  have led to question the sustainability of the Euro area and the capacity of certain member states to fulfil their commitments with respect to the single currency. The numerous austerity plans implemented within the Economic and Monetary Union in the current context of crisis constitute additional arguments for certain states to leave the single currency and retrieve their fiscal and monetary independences. It is not unconceivable anymore for countries such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and Spain (the PIIGS) to envisage exiting the Euro area. This thesis considers the issue of determining the optimal monetary regime  flexible exchange rates or monetary union  for the 17 Eurozone countries, accounting for the current financial and sovereign debt crises. Chapter 1 is general and aims at formally establishing the occurrence of a structural break attributable to the 1999 passage to the single currency. It shows that such a break did take place for Euro area countries around 1992, the year which marked the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty and the settlement of the convergence criteria for the Euro. This break is not shared by the three European States which chose to preserve their own currencies (the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark). Chapter 2 constitutes the core of this work. It introduces the benchmark model used to perform the comparison between the two monetary regimes considered for the Euro area. It features a two-country open-economy model integrating financial frictions through cross-border interbank markets. Once calibrated for the Euro area, the model suggests that financial rigidities may play a substantial role in the dynamics of Eurozone economies, with a potentially significant impact of shocks affecting the partner economies over national developments. Preliminary financial crisis simulations run on the model prove inconclusive to assess the performances of the two monetary regimes contemplated. On the one hand, the flexible exchange rate regime results in improved stability, but on the other hand the monetary union typically allows for faster recovery following the initial crisis trigger. The third and final chapter meets a double purpose. It first proposes a formal welfare criteria to assess the respective performances of the two monetary regimes under consideration for the Euro area. It then augments the benchmark model with a number of extensions, so as to integrate sovereign debt and the diverse credit policies (Covered Bonds Purchase Programme and Securities Markets Programme) implemented by the ECB since the beginning of the crisis to the basic framework. The results show that absent credit policies, a vast majority of Euro area members (15 out of 17) would enjoy higher welfare levels under a flexible exchange rate regime. These conclusions nevertheless reverse under the Securities Markets Programme, where a majority of member states then favour the monetary union. This suggests that the ECB has a role to play for the Euro area which goes beyond its primary function of monetary policy maker."
"When facing high uncertainty systems, such as dams, where experts heuristics becomes too much important, usual tools are not satisfying enough to reveal experts’ opinion in order to manage the risks associated with the system. Decision science then brings tools to sharpen our understanding, or even help the elicitation, of what the expert wants best to express. Concerning dams, we have only very little feedback, and no to few significant events. In addition to the lack of knowledge when it comes to the phenomenological mechanisms, these issues lead us to use unusual tools for risk management. This study brings an innovative tool to help on the elicitation of experts’ opinion, allowing risk management on dams based on an ordering approach. Furthermore, we will show this tool is an estimation of the maximum likelihood, which is invaluable information for any decision maker. We will show this result is obtainable through a method using rule based assignments, developing the rules thanks to tools like votes, games and database theories. Doing so, we will show how it is possible to process risks without using usual probabilistic tools, while taking experts’ heuristics into account."
"This dissertation presents three essays on disruptions along nutritional high-value food supply chains in emerging countries. It extends our understanding of threats to the attainment of food security in emerging countries. With a contribution to agricultural economics, the dissertation relies on value chain, market growth and price transmission theories and applies both panel data and time series econometric techniques to analyse the sources and magnitudes of the disruption of nutritional high-value food chains.The first part of the dissertation examines disruptions in unprocessed and minimally processed nutritional high-value food markets. Chapter 2 examines upstream and downstream disruptions along these food chains. Chapter 3 extends the analysis in Chapter 2 by assessing how disruptions change when nutritional high-value foods are highly processed. For each of the two chapters, disruptions are studied in terms of changes in upstream and downstream quantities and prices, with the disruption of quantity considered primary while that of prices is secondary.Using the São Paulo food market as a case study, Chapter 4 analyses the effect of diesel price shocks on different segments of the nutritional high-value food supply chain. A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) that takes into account upstream and downstream cross-price effects is estimated to ascertain if diesel price shocks are higher downstream based on price transmission theory.The results of Chapters 2 and 3 show that climatological disasters are the most dominant source of disruption of nutritional high-value food supply chains and the direction of impact is negative for all foods under study. The magnitude of disruption, however, varies by food. From the VECM results in Chapter 4, we see that the price of diesel has a positive and significant effect on food prices, while the effects downstream are lower than those upstream. These results have significant implications for the design and implementation of food policies in emerging countries.As a general introduction, Chapter 1 justifies the need to study upstream and downstream differences in the magnitude of supply chain disruption, by situating the dissertation in the existing supply chain and food price transmission literature. Chapter 5 concludes the study and offers suggestions for future research."
"This thesis deals with two aspects of the transition towards a low-carbon economy: how to define a strategy under the uncertainties and inertia surrounding power systems, and what are the impacts of this transition on employment?To study the choice of a strategy, I focus on the case of the French power system. The 58 nuclear reactors are reaching the end of their initially planned lifetime, but they can be retrofitted for a cost estimated at a \euro 100 billion for the entire fleet. How many reactors should be retrofitted? I study this question using an optimization model of the French power system and the \textit{Robust Decision Making} framework. My results indicate that the most interesting strategies consist in closing 7 to 14 reactors in favor of renewable energies, given current estimates.As to employment impacts, I study the notion of employment content and offer an original methodology to break it down and understand the relative importance of four components: import rates, taxes and subsidies, the share of labour in value added and the level of wage.Then, I study the employment impacts of shifting investment towards low-carbon sectors with general equilibrium models, and highlight their underlying economic mechanisms.My results suggest that encouraging sectors with a high share of labor or low wages might increase employment, but they also challenge the benefits of targeting sectors with a low import rate."
"Local production of edible oils in the WAEMU’s countries is no longer a credible defense line against imports. This reality contrasts with the objectives of agriculture policy and WAEMU’s Common External Tariff (CET) which are supposed to protect Community production. Thus, under the light of the economic literature and based on empirical data, we used simultaneous equations for each country of WAEMU, panel data and gravity equations with panel data to determine the impact of trade liberalization on supply of edible oils in WAEMU’s countries.The results obtained converge towards the same conclusion: the confrontation of objectives of protecting local production and trade openness policy with the coherence’s tests reveals some inconsistencies and contradictions. Thus, WAEMU fails to reconcile the Union's trade openness objectives with the protection objectives of edible oils producers. Trade liberalization policies have tended to favor a disintegration of the productive structure and disruption of trade architecture. Thus, the supply of edible oils shows two contradictory reactions with regard to the trade liberalization within the WAEMU’s countries: a depressive reaction displayed by the production and an explosive reaction displayed by the imports which are attracted by re-export rents. However, these rents are mirages that reserve destructive economic implications with the adoption of ECOWAS’CET."
"The object of this thesis is to study in a context of financialization of commodity markets, some strategies adopted by investors and their impact on volatility and excess co-movement between energy markets and financial markets. To this end, three studies are proposed. The first study uses the approach VAR with Switching Regime (MS-VAR) applied to energy markets during the period 1992-2017. The results suggest that during high volatility period, commercial agents (hedging agents) play a crucial role in the discovery of gas market prices. However, these agents affect the efficiency of other markets (crude oil, gasoline, heating oil) and amplify their volatilities. The second study employs GARCH ADCC versus GARCH DCC models for a sample of 17 countries and covering the period 1997-2016. This study highlights the asymmetric effect of oil shocks on the conditional correlations of the Asian and African markets, which can be explained in particular by the arbitrage activities and the heterogeneous behavior of investors. The third study focuses on Autoregressive Distributed Lag models (ARDL) and reveals that after the financial crisis, and beyond the macroeconomic and financial fundamentals, the index of excessive speculation, explains in long term as well as in short term, the correlation between oil market and some financial markets. This generates a phenomenon of excess co-movement, and therefore a financializing effect on these markets. Finally, we can conclude that : firstly, during high volatility period, gas market is a safe haven for financial investors ; secondly, the behavior of the investor explains the effect of excess co-movement between the oil market and some financial markets ; thirdly, this phenomenon of excess co-movement limits the benefits of international portfolio diversification especially during financial turbulences."
"THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE CLINICAL APPROACH TO WORK AS APPLIED TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE CEO’S “SELF-PRESENTATION” The purpose of this research is to explore what it is that, in the cross between CEO subjectivity and his work, allows to better understand behaviors that are often considered irrational. Following a critical review of the literature of organizational behavior and psycho-sociology that deals with the CEO, as well as of the management literature relating to his activity, the field of work-psychodynamics establishes itself as the theoretical reference for this research, despite never actually having penetrated the field of top management. With its grounding in an understanding of management as well as in concepts drawn from the field of work-psychodynamics, this research proposes a clinical approach to the work of the CEO, in other words a clinical study of the gap between prescribed work and actual work. As a source of knowledge of the prescribed tasks of the CEO, management literature tends to point to “self-presentation” as one aspect of that work. Consequently, the scope of this research focuses on the analysis of this “self-presentation”, whose triple dimension is revealed in interviews conducted with fifteen male and female CEOs: firstly, a means of expressive action and a way of coping with the constraints of prescribed mastery, secondly, a means of achieving recognition and finally, a strategy of defense against suffering at work, thus revealing the subjective rationality of their behaviors. We then discuss the theoretical and methodological implications on work-psychodynamics, the contribution to management science, as well as implications on managerial ethics, thereby opening the way to defining a methodology of intervention for this specific population."
"Although interlocking directorates are regularly associated with a negative connotation, empirical evidence is far away from offering convincing answers about the performance effects of directorship interlocks. The huge variety of contradicting results can be explained both by the use of different theoretical frameworks and different value creation measures. In order to shed more light on the question of the role of busy directors, we develop a two-pillar model explaining the potential contributions of directorship interlocks to shareholder value creation. Based on a synthetic view of corporate governance, the model uses two disciplinary (work overload of busy directors and incentive effects coming from the external labor market of corporate directors) as well as three cognitive intervention levers (provision of information and knowledge, provision of general and specific competences, combination and exploitation of those elements). Moderating and controlling variables are added. The appropriateness of the model is tested through a 5-year comparison (2001-2005) of director networks within the largest French and German companies. We first present, both for a bi-national sample and national sub-samples, the major characteristics of the identified interlocks. In the empirical part, we conduct a panel data analysis checking for the influence of busy directors on corporate performance. We use two performance measures: one ex ante, the other ex post. Empirical tests indicate that the performance effect of interlocks depend on the type of board seats accumulated. Moreover, statistical modeling confirms the existence of cognitive contributions of director networks and shows mostly positive effects on value creation. Also, markets seem to anticipate director effects – both negative and positive – in a stronger way than an ex post performance analysis shows."
"Over the last ten years, real estate prices have risen considerably and accordingly to most observers, this can at least partly be attributed to an insufficient supply, due to local growth control measures. This thesis tries to understand what motivates local authorities implementing such policies. Local politicians are considered as opportunistic and their decision is modelled as the result of a political struggle between different land-related interests. This game for influence mainly opposes the owners of developed and undeveloped land, who find allies amongst local business interests that might form growth or ideas machines. Our first model describes this struggle under different hypotheses concerning the influence of voting and lobbying. We show that the growth controls implemented might under some conditions be less strict the greater the percentage of homeowners in the local population – despite the fact that homeowners favour strict policies. When individuals are mobile, local decisions become interdependent, and under imperfect mobility our theoretically derived equilibrium solution can directly be interpreted as a spatial autoregressive model. Our empirical analysis concerning the “taxe locale d’équipement” confirms our predictions concerning strategic interactions and shows that local decisions are influenced by “homevoters” and ideas machines on the one side, and by the local farmers on the other side. Our second model examines if local politicians use growth control policies strategically in order to modify the local electorate in a manner that facilitates their re-election. Our model is based on probabilistic voting and the composition of the local population is considered as endogenous. Our empirical analysis confirms that zoning decisions are influenced by the mobility of the local electorate, even if we cannot ascertain that politicians are acting strategically."
"The present thesis investigates the nature of relationship between the employee stock ownership and the wealth creation, in the framework of the shareholder governance and the stakeholder governance. Results indicate a non linear relation between both the employee stock ownership and the shareholder value creation taking an inversed-U form. In fact, a positive relation associates these variables for low levels of employee stock ownership. Starting from a level of 3%, the relation became negative. Results notice also a positive impact of employee stock ownership plan on the share of value allocated to employees when the percentage of employee stock ownership is significant. Under than 3% the employee stock ownership and the voting rights held by the employees presents a non significant impact. The principal results on the influence of certain mechanisms of control on the studied relationship between the employee stock ownership plan and the wealth creation are summarized as follows : Beyond the legal strategic level of 33%, the concentration of capital seems to have a positive moderating effect on the relation employee stock ownership plan – shareholder wealth creation and the relation employee stock ownership plan - share of the wealth allocated to the employees. The management ownership if exceeds the legal strategic level of 33% seems to exert a negative moderating effect on the relation between employee stock ownership and shareholder wealth creation but a positive one on the relation between the employee stock ownership and the share of the wealth allocated to the employees. The presence of the employees’ shareholder in the board of directors moderates negatively the relationship between the employee stock ownership plan and the shareholder wealth creation and positively that between the employee stock ownership plan and the share of the wealth allocated to the employees."
"Corporate Social Responsibility is commonly accepted within the business community as a new platform to drive success in mitigating new emerging risks and facilitating access to emerging markets. However, in doing so, businesses are now facing new barriers derived from the difficulty on how to implement such a complex new market expectation. The challenge ahead is now to turn these obstacles into opportunities. CSR is asking businesses to notably open their risk management to external pressures, especially direct stakeholders. In that respect, this research paper intends to focus on the relationship with suppliers for a responsible supply chain management. Various aspects of this specific stakeholder shall be treated throughout the paper: What are the risks? How a CSR vision should be implemented in the whole supply chain? What are the relevant tools and methods? We have analysed various theoretical trends (contract theory, transaction costs theory, stakeholders theory, etc…) coupled with numerous businesses case studies in order to offer a relevant and up to date stakeholder mapping with regards to Sustainable procurement"
"The thesis focuses on the aggregated non-power sector covered under the EU ETS. First, the non-power sector contribution to CO2 emissions changes in the first two phases of the Scheme (2005-2012), both from a final demand perspective and a supply perspective, is compared to that of the power sector at first. Then, the implications of the non-power sector specific free allocation methodology in the third phase of the Scheme (2013-2020) are scrutinized, which constitutes one of the first thorough assessment of Phase 3 benchmarking. It is showed that both from a final demand perspective and a supply perspective, the non-power sector, through its interrelated character and its activity levels, has contributed to changes in EU ETS CO2 emissions more than the power sector did, over the 2005-2012 period. It is also showed that, despite its free allocation redistribution effects, benchmark-based Phase 3 free allocation remains flawed and may benefit from further improvements to be up to the central role of the non-power sector in the EU ETS dynamics."
"In the globalization, the frame and the architecture of the firm have to adjust to the evolution of markets. Financial and commercial market transforms fordist integrate firm. The question is to understand the setting-up of the firm in this background. How the post-fordist firm build again his combination and agreement ? We define the firm as an efficient association of normativity descended from financial and goods markets and from technical processes of production. Theses both normativities could come into conflict. The principle of the firm is to build up a compromise able to stabilize a product that can be simultaneously produced and sold. Without that compromise, a firm breaks up. Grounded on firm's theory and economies of worth, we study the processes of building-up compromises in a restricted space. How stakeholders, shareholders,executive board, worker build on, give reason and rationalize, together or separately, a compromise. But the compromise can be unfinished and fragmented, the technical normativity hide by project management. So the compromise turns out to a power struggle, the equivalences between normativity no more legitimate. "
"This thesis studies consumer' behavior in the case of quality differentiated products. Our results are based on the experimental preference eliciting methods. Two choice paradoxes are studied in the case of food products : divergence between willingness to accept and willingness to pay and the preference reversals phenomenon. This phenomenon occurs when the valuation of two options do no present the same order of preference as a strict choice between them. Moreover, the effects of new information on consumer's choices are studied and also the link between hedonic scores and monetary valuations are considered. Our results show a more important gap between willingness to accept and willingness to pay in the case of less familiar products. The overall rate of preference reversals is 25% which is lower than the rate found in the classical studies of the phenomenon. These resultants are then studied in the light of four theories of choice : expected utility theory, prospect theory, regret theory and cognitive consistency theory. "
"This PhD is focused on the economic impacts due to a livestock disease outbreak. This kind of sanitary shock represents a productive risk with many implications, extending its effects to the whole livestock industry or even to the overall economy of the region or country, as observed for example during the mad cow disease crisis in the late 1990s. From the economic literature, it appears that these crises are catastrophic market events, and that they lead to a gradual adjustment in the herd. Thus we propose an economic modelling of market dynamics in livestock, in order to capture the indirect and long run effects related to the occurrence of a disease outbreak. The analysis reveals that the shock makes indebtedness grow and may lead to farm closure. The access to credit plays a crucial role for farm solvency, and this situation may also ultimately penalize consumers as well. At the country level, the comprehension of the impacts of a health crisis is possible thanks to a dynamic computable general equilibrium modelling, which integrates intertemporal decisions of farmers –including livestock farmers–, and market imperfections for production factors. The model is applied to Brittany, a French livestock-intensive region. Simulation results show that the health shock weighs on all livestock sectors, and finally affects the whole regional economy. In this context, the lack of flexibility in capital and labour markets increases the social cost of the disease, and delays the return of economic activity. Finally, we show that public support for farm income in a period of crisis tends to reduce the magnitude and the duration of the shock. Participation of farmers in this policy, through the implementation of mutual funds, moves the risk management costs to those agents, but ultimately proves more costly socially. "
"Over the last forty years, an oil tanker has sunk off the Brittany coast of France every five years on average. Each time, the ecological damage from the oil slick has mobilised huge numbers of people to volunteer and demonstrate, and generated public controversy and criticism of regulatory procedures. Although oil spills provoke evident impacts, neither the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) nor French Law recognise environmental detriment as a motif for financial compensation by the operators. The damages and pollution are taken into account firstly as economic and material losses, and secondly in terms of damage to biodiversity requiring habitat restoration actions. Critics highlight the feeble deterrent and the lack of incentive for maritime oil transporters to reduce risks: in relation to their profits the costs of an oil slick to them is regarded as derisory. These critics also call for recognition of ecological damages by the law. This would allow environmental pollution to incur economic and juridical responsibilities, and for environmental harm to require compensation.This research project looks at change processes leading to the recognition of ecological damage from oil slicks. We do not add to the existing substantial debate over the efficiency or interest of integrating environmental concerns into conduct rules and the legal system, nor evaluate different methods for doing do. Instead we study the realities of ecological damage, and analyse actions for change implemented by different actors to provoke their recognition. This analysis is based on two case studies: the oil slicks from the Amoco Cadiz (1978) and the Erika (1999).We explore an alternative and wider approach to understanding the harm caused by an oil slick, by considering that it damages multiple relationships between man and the environment. Using the concept of pragmatic sociology (Thévenot, “L’action au pluriel”, 2006) we reveal the multiple realities of ecological damage in terms of the relations between humans and nonhumans. These relations cannot be described in purely commercial nor ecological terms. Using a strategic analysis of environmental management (Mermet et al., 2005), we study how actors elaborate an action for change and how the action represents environmental damage. We look particularly at how the challenge of the action leads to certain choices when qualifying the damage to the courts.Thus, the study proposes new information on ecological damage, allowing the definition to be renewed (theoretical interest). By examining ecological damage in terms of harm to human – nonhuman relations, it provides an interesting support for new forms of justification in the public arena, and promotes legal recognition of ecological damage (operational interest). Finally, the study brings together, and shows to be complementary, two conceptual frameworks hereto unarticulated in human sciences. The study reveals the multiple individual and collective realities of environmental dynamics, and thus allows a richer understanding of the implementation of an action for change than a standard analysis of collective action (Cefai, 2007)."
"Rice has become a primary consumed product in Benin. Studies have revealed it will become the most consumed cereal in west Africa within the next decades. Despite the resources Benin possesses favouring rice culture and the government measures to promote it, the household supply remains unsatisfactory when compared to the objective set by the country to reach food sovereignty.  The present essay analyses the government policies in order to reach a sustainable food sovereignty through rice culture. In depth, exploratory surveys have been conducted among the rice farmers. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected through structured questionnaires and guided interviews revealing the comparative advantage local rice has over imported one. Efforts have yet to be made in order for Malanville rice famers to reduce their production costs and become more competitive. Education level, access to loans, rice farmers experience as well as their social status are the key factors influencing the implementation of new technologies allowing an increase of productivity. Rice production and food sovereignty should be attained by implementing simultaneously income support policies, funded fertilizers, climate-smart culture and ploughing by oxen."
"This thesis investigates the impacts of financialization on exchange rates of emerging marketeconomies (EMEs). With financialization, finance follows a patrimonial and increasinglyspeculative logic at the international level, reflecting innovations of products and practicessuch as FX derivatives and carry trading by money managers. Through their portfolioallocation decisions, these portfolio investors bridge markets and currencies across the globe, their decisions being key to exchange rate determination. Simultaneously, some EMEs have been facing high exchange rate volatility, especially in moments of turbulence in international financial markets. The thesis seeks to answer whether these dynamics are associated with financialization and why they are stronger in some EMEs. Specifically, it raises the hypothesis that the use of an EME's assets and currency in those innovative strategies increases emerging currencies' fragility to money managers' decisions, thus to conditions of financial markets worldwide. To test this hypothesis an indicator of financialized integration is suggested and compared to countries' exchange-rate features. Results demonstrate a strong association of financialization with higher exchange rate volatility, more frequent extreme depreciations, closer association with international financial conditions, and high correlation with other emerging currencies. Apart from scrutinizing emerging currencies' special dynamics and their reasons, the thesis suggests  a Minskyan open-economy  framework that details the underlying mechanisms and forms of modeling keyelements to explain exchange rate dynamics in the SFC framework."

"This thesis appraises, from the point of view of the history of economic thought, the debates which occured, from 1968 to 1998, between radical political economics and mainstream economics about the origins and functions of hierarchy and authority in firms"
"In the past two decades, the fraction of the population in developed countries that is foreign-born increased from 7% in 1990 to 10% in 2010. The rise in the demographic importance of international migration led to a parallel increase in the amount of time and effort that economists devote to studying the consequences of immigration. One of the main questions raised by economists is related to the labor impact of migration in receiving economies. What is the impact of immigration on the employment and earnings of native workers ? This dissertation contributes to the immigration literature through a deep empirical investigation on the effects of immigrants on native wages and employment in France over the 1990-2010 period. This dissertation is composed of two main parts. The first part investigates the short-run effects of immigration on the outcomes of competing native workers (who have skills similar to those of the migrants). I find that immigration has a very small negative impact on the wages of competing natives. This result is consistent with the prevalence of downward wage rigidities in France. However, I show that immigration decreases the employment rate of natives with similar education and experience : a 10% increase in the immigrant share due to an influx of immigrants is associated with a 3% fall in the employment rate of competing natives. Since immigrants are relatively more attractive for firms (while they are identical to natives in all other respects), a substitution mechanism operates between natives and immigrants. The second part extends the analysis by providing a full picture of the wage impact of immigration in France. In this part, I allow the labor market to adjust to immigration in the long-run. In addition, I account for the complementarity effects induced by immigration on the wages of natives with different skills. The estimates indicate no detrimental impact of immigration on the average wage of natives. This part also provides the distributional effects of immigration by education and gender. In as much immigrants to France has been disproportionately high educated in the past two decades, I find that immigration has reduced the wage of highly educated native workers and has contributed to raise the wage of low educated. Thus, immigration-induced shocks to French labor supply have served to reduce wage inequality between low educated and high educated workers. Moreover, I find that immigration has lowered the relative wage of female natives and increased the wage of male natives. This asymmetric effect is due to the facts that immigration has disproportionately increased the number of female workers since 1990, and also that men and women of similar education are imperfect substitutes in the production process."
"This thesis focuses on the sustainable consumer behaviour of households. When consumer behaviours allow for individual utility, at the expense of public interest, these can be analysed as a social dilemma. Experiments in public good games allow for testing behaviours of individuals subjected to social dilemma situations. Sustainable consumption can be considered as a voluntary contribution to a public good. The objective is to better understand the mechanisms behind voluntary contributions to public goods that generate externalities. Three experiments will allow us to analyse the differences in contributions between a private good and public goods, public bad(s) and club goods. We focus on the negative externalities of a public bad, the exclusivity of the club good and the effects of multiple public goods."
"The diversification of the offer of terroir products forces distributors to question their allocation in the store. The thesis proposes to reflect on the allocation of terroir products in the French context by adopting an inter-categorial approach, at the general level of the store. This research examines the role of shelf space allocation strategies in increasing the accessibility and ease of purchase of terroir products in-store, on the one hand, and in increasing financial performance, on the other hand. Therefore, both an exploratory qualitative study and an experiment in a store have been conducted for the categories of terroir products."
"This dissertation studies African financial systems with a focus on bank ownership. Chapter one studies cost efficiency. Foreign banks are more efficient than domestic banks, and Pan-African banks are the most efficient banks on the continent. Chapter two analyses lending procyclicality. Lending growth of African banks is sensitive to the GDP per capita growth. Pan-African banks have a less pro-cyclical lending behaviour. Lending growth of African foreign banks is sensitive to GDP per capita growth in their home country. Chapter three and four study financial inclusion. Being male, wealthier, more educated and older to a certain extent increases the likelihood to be financially included. Pan-African banks presence increases firms’ access to credit. Pan-African banks would also increase households’ financial inclusion, but such result is less robust.The general conclusion of this dissertation underlines the new, beneficial role Pan-African banks play on the continent. These young financial institutions increase cost efficiency, reduce cyclicality of lending and improve financial inclusion."
"Individual offshoring emerges as a new form of organizational-initiated expatriation which bridges self-initiated-expatriation and international assignment. The failure of IA to retain talented individuals (talent) and a growing pressure on costs leave no choice to companies but to dramatically reconsider how expatriation can develop talent globally in a different but still sustainable way.However, this new form of expatriation resonates as a breach of the psychological contract. If talent no longer expect to remain in the same company for a large part of their career, they still hold an expectation that white collar activities associated to higher degrees would protect their jobs from moving abroad. This thesis was a case study of a company offshoring some of its global talent to lower cost locations. The purpose was to understand what factors talent consider in accepting to relocate to a lower cost location under a local contract. This research contributes to talent retention and sustained talent management while offshoring ac-tivities to lower cost countries."
"The main purpose of this thesis is to understand how a national association sport policy is elaborated. The case of the French Rugby Union (FFR) is studied as part of an intervention-research, as this organisation initiated some reflections around its sport policy, an object that we had both to apprehend and conceptualise. This object is considered as a co-construction process, between national and regional actors. In order to study this, we mobilise the Actor-Network Theory (Akrich et al., 2006), associated with the concept of prescriptive relation (Oiry, 2012). The Actor-Network Theory (also known as the sociology of translation) highlights the presence of both human and non-human actors which can have an impact on this process. In this way, our research question is: what are the actors' dynamics during the co-construction process of the federal sport policy? The general idea, throughout our framework, is to express how the (human) actors, thanks to their representations (their translation) and their collaboration / confrontation (their prescriptive relation) are going to co-construct the federal sport policy. The aim of this thesis is to apprehend both the integration of this sport policy into the federal organisation (the FFR) and the creation of an actor-network, which, simultaneously, is configuring and stabilising itself."
"This thesis investigates the role of collateral environment and trade exposure on the allocation of employment across firms and sectors. The first chapter argues that, in these economies with poor institutional quality of collateral and bankruptcy laws, aggressive collateralization makes the risk-taking behavior of borrowers suboptimally more costly. This discourages entrepreneurship and thus impedes the growth potential among young firms with a potentially high impact on job creation in the economy.Second chapter stresses the ""disconnection"" channel on the performance of firms when stringent collateral environment impedes the access of firms to financial system. Studying the 6 economies in MENA we observe region is characterized by an unusually highshare of firms that do not need external finance. These firms are less likely to view access to finance as a major concern, are less likely to have purchased fixed assets, andare less likely to plan further expansion. These findings also hold after accounting fora standard set of firm characteristics. In the third chapter, I move to a sample of OECD countries. A growing body of literature emphasizes the role of trade with emerging economies, especially with China, in job destruction in the manufacturing sectors andin the deindustrialization process currently seen in advanced economies. However, to quantify the relevance of exposure to imports from emerging markets, the trade channel needs to be disentangled from the traditional productivity channel. Developing asimple model of structural change in an open economy, I derive empirical implicationsto analyze for a sample of OECD countries. The model illustrates when productivity growth of domestic manufacturing is faster than that of services but slower than that of foreign manufacturing, the share of manufacturing in advanced economies may fall,both in terms of value added and of employment. I call this phenomenon ""twin deindustrialization"".My empirical results indicate significant and quantitatively relevant effects of trade on structural change in advanced economies. Furthermore, while many studies investigate the accelerating volume of imports from China post 2000 to explain the pattern of deindustrialization in advance economies, I stress that the shift in the composition of Chinese exports towards the ICT sectors and the changing nature of technological progress occurring in emerging economies are important considerations in understanding the pattern of deindustrialization in the post 2000 period."
"This thesis deals with the study of optimization problems in the transportation domain. We first address the inventory routing problem and we consider the traveling salesman problem with draft limits in a second part. In both cases we have developed methods based on the variable neighborhood search to solve these NP-hard problems. We have proposed several efficient neighborhood structures and solving frameworks. The global evaluation of the proposed approach on sets of benchmarks available in the litterature shows a remarkable efficency and effectiveness. In particular, our algorithms have improved the results obtained by the current best approaches for these two problems."
"The Subject of this thesis is to analyze the determiners of the community involvement of a company (RSE) in an emerging country such as Morocco. The purpose of the present research is to analyze this relation empirically. In fact, the new international economic environment characterized by deep changes, particularly, economic and financial globalization as well as the important regulatory and technological modifications that are taking place nowadays tend to give the priority to other strategic orientations relating to the prospects of sustainable development, and clarifying the societal commitment in managerial practices. The main goal of any company is to ensure its sustainability to the benefit of its customers, its shareholders and its collaborators. A company can become a committed social actor and not simply content itself with being an economic agent generating wealth. It can also get involved and adhere to better positioning itself with regard to the sustainable development which requires the production and sale within the best economic conditions while keeping a good image, namely, its ethical behavior, and by guaranteeing that its products are socially humanly and ecologically correct. Thus it can reconcile the safeguarding of the environment, social equity and the financial and economic requirements. Therefore, two parts were devoted to elucidating the various questions raised in this respect: The first part presents a review of the theoretical and conceptual approaches of the social responsibility of a company and its overall Performance and the potential links between these two components. The second part is devoted to the epistemological and methodological positioning, to the presentation of the model and the research hypotheses, as well as the analysis of the results of the empirical study. The results make it possible to answer our question: What are the determiners of the community involvement of the certified Moroccan companies RSE?"
"The temporary employment sector has greatly democratized in recent decades and generates numerous negative externalities for civil society. Indeed, the temporary employment sector is a source of social vulnerability for the temporary workers,  in a society where individuals are socially integrated through their jobs. The temporary employment sector contributes in the precarious of life and work conditions, relegation and social exclusion. To limit these social deviations and internalize societal issues, the temporary work companies (TWC) are encouraged, through extra-financial reporting, to engage in CSR. The TWC value their commitment through a voluntary social communication, which is based in particular on the production of a CSR/Sustainable Development report. The societal communication vehicle commitments by TWC to protect the temporary workers’s interests. The objectives of social communication are numerous : improve the image and the reputation, promote self-regulation activities, allowing continuous access to temporary resources, reduce supervision activities by public authorities, legitimize the existence of ETT despite these negative externalities, generate positive attitudes of stakeholders, contribute to the overall performance and reduce hidden costs due to the staff turnover. The CSR commitment must be deployed within the TWC and arouse the collective membership of the internal stakeholders. However, the academic literature on the CSR commitment in the temporary employment sector is a gap between social communication and the actual practices of TWC. In contrast, this gap causes the opposite effect and generates negative attitudes of stakeholders towards TWC. Given these challenges, the lack of information in the academic literature and the lack of empirical studies on the gap between social communication and the actual practices of TWC led us to formulate our overall research problem. Our research aim to make significant contributions in this emerging area of research."
"Information literacy is one of competences conferred to individual employability in information and knowledge society (IKS). By Requiring employable skills (EC), this society acquires a new dimension (SICS & CE) and passes labor market from classic concept of ""job market"" to ""employability market (MEMP)"" seeking flexibility and adaptive skills to changes.  Foresight Scanning in general and specifically digital one, works by its ""Information and Knowledge Production Process""  to develop information literacy/Internet (CIVI) to improve various individual skills. In this sense, this thesis evolves in a qualitative and interpretative exploratory approach, to treat the issue of quality skills development, defining the employability of university students. It seeks to know how a universities’ foresight scanning will improve quality of their employable CIVI culture skill, by adopting in its informational production process, a market-oriented relational marketing involving university students as ""internal customers "", as well as employability market actors as"" external customers "" ?Evolving in a socio-constructivist perspective, series of evaluations on skills and satisfactions of learners as well as their skills CIVI assessment models were developed as part of a competency based approach (SBA) adopting a relational internal and external marketing. This approach is characterized firstly by an ""Orientation-Involvement of Learners-Clients: OI-APCL"" and secondly by an ""Orientation-Involvement of employability market: OI-MEMP,"" based on an educational blog as informational Web.2.0 System and monitoring tool designed to develop competency in information literacy learners. This led us to conclude in the orientation forward an  employability university, skills levels improvement by declining secular groups CIVI culture, from 88.74% to 41.94% and a need for training CIVI rate of Culture from 89.50% to 46.50% resulting to learner employability and the recruitment of three groups of the 20 pairs graduate students involved in our work, This recommends adoption of an "" Foresight Scanning employability"" for quality development skills in SICS&CE society seeking now more than information and knowledge, but also flexibility skills to adapt changes and innovations defining really individual employability."
"This dissertation questions the determinants of employee savings behavior. Chapter 1 presents an overview of employee savings schemes. We then detail the main rules of employee savings schemes. Finally, we present the main determinants of the behavior of employee savings schemes identified by the literature. Chapter 2 examines the socio-economic determinants of employee savings’ portfolio efficiency. It also proposes an analysis of the determinants of investment errors of employees measured by an index. We dissociate investments made in the context of Employee stock purchase plan and those made through other employee savings plans. We are interested in the binary decision to invest or not on the one hand and in the portfolio efficiency on the other hand. Our sample covers 30,000 employees of a French bank, contains information on the individual characteristics of employees and details of the amounts invested in the plans, their risk and risk characteristics. The characteristics of the employees significantly affect the efficiency of the portfolios. We highlight a strong concentration of company stocks. We also show that the investment of employees is not optimal given the gap between the optimal Sharpe ratio and the actual Sharpe ratio. We finally regress this difference on the characteristics of the employees. Chapter 3 empirically analyzes the determinants of investment in company shares. Employee stock ownership would reduce the withdrawal behavior of employees, such as absenteeism and turnover. However, the reverse causality we assume had never been analyzed: the effect of absenteeism and the staff turnover on the investment in employer’s stocks. We show that absenteeism and staff turnover significantly affect participation. We validate our hypotheses using a variety of regression methods. We analyze a panel of approximately 15,000 employees of nearly 900 subsidiaries over a period of 5 years of a French listed company belonging to the construction, public works and concessions sector. Participation in employee stock ownership plan depends on the level of absenteeism and turnover of employees within the company. Absenteeism and staff turnover influence the investment in company shares differently depending on the employee's occupations category and the reasons for absences and departures. Chapter 4 analyze the results of a survey we sent to individual savers to assess their financial literacy. We translated the surveys of Lusardi and the European Central Bank to produce a questionnaire adapted to the French case. We see the influence of financial education on investment decisions. The questionnaire was distributed to the employees of a bank on the one hand and their customers on the other. Although our results generally confirm the literature on financial literacy, we identify several new findings."
"The aim of our thesis is to study the current practice of CSR in the context of the Lebanese industrial companies and to examine the relationship between CSR practices and risk management, using statistical techniques as inferential tests, factor analysis and multiple linear regression models. It is in the latter that the main contribution of this research has been made. This research has made it possible to perceive CSR as more than just a marketing and public relations tool but also a real tool influencing risk in companies. Our research broadens the knowledge base in this field in the Lebanese context, focusing on the management and practices of the company in terms of risk management, in order to better manage the social, environmental, and community based activities by CSR. The results of this study will enable researchers to create a stronger theoretical and empirical basis on which future research on the subject of CSR and risk management through CSR can be developed."
"The health sector has experienced many changes over the last decades which entails a loss of caregivers’ bearings affecting their employment relationship. This thesis is placed along the avenues of research suggested by the literature which highlight the focus put on the consequences of the breach and violation of the psychological contract, neglecting its construction and dynamics. This doctoral work is intended to be a contribution to these less studied aspects through a longitudinal qualitative approach. A year-long case study was carried out with a cohort of 40 newly-graduated nurses who were recruited in 18 French health facilities nationally. The reciprocity of the contract is also considered from the perspective of the management representatives. The data resulting from 219 interviews conducted were complemented with observations and documentary analysis. On the theoretical level, the approach adopted enables the dynamics of the psychological contract to be understood and a model to be proposed; from the anticipated creation, during nursing studies, up to a stabilized phase after a year of professional activity in a care service. On the managerial level, this work suggests possible reasoning for the construction of a sustainable and satisfying employment relationship between the hospital structure and caregivers."
"We develop an agent-based model to replicate two frequently observed anomalies in the financial markets: the fat tails and the clustered volatility of the distribution of the returns. Our goal is to show conclusively that these anomalies could be attributed to a mimetic formation of the expectations of the stakeholders in the markets. We did not follow the rencent developpments in the field of the ACE model in the finance, but we propose a very simple model which is estimated from the stylized facts of the French daily index CAC 40. The hypothesis of mimetic anticipations can thus be tested: it is not rejected in our modeling."
"Informal employment became a serious challenge for the Ukrainian economy and economy of transition countries during the adjustment to market conditions. Trends of the number of workers participating in the informal sector have been rising for the last years. In my research I will present the current state of informal employment of Ukraine and transition countries. Detailed attention is paid to labour distribution across different population categories by dividing the individuals into five categories (formal employee, informal employee, formal self-employed, informal self-employed and unemployed) following the definition of informal employment from the ILO. We examine labour market using the data of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey for Ukraine and the Survey on Living and Income Conditions for transition countries and we design human capital earnings function for labour market by applying Mincer earnings distribution function in order to investigate the factors that determine the individual’s earnings and choice of the employment status both for Ukraine and transition countries."
"Highly skilled workers – scientists and engineers in particular – are an important asset for a nation in so far that they enter in the production of knowledge as highly valuable human capital. That is why many countries have been competing for attracting. Receiving countries are in general pictured as the biggest winners from highly skilled migration. While the latter is perceived as a loss for sending countries. However, the situation might not be as simplistic as it seems. Indeed, we believe there are several unexplored factors underpinning the dynamics of highly skilled migration which contribute to some positive feedback to the sending countries in terms of knowledge and innovation while spurring innovation in the destination countries. And for a better understanding of these factors, one needs to look further into the nature of the ties linking highly skilled migrants abroad on one hand and to their home countries on the other hand. With our research we intend to contribute to the brain drain – brain gain trade-off debate by investigating the dynamics of knowledge diffusion within migrants’ networks in receiving countries and more importantly to sending countries."
"The creation of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership group (C40) in 2005 is a noteworthy example that the urban scale is considered as a major leeway to mitigate CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the adequacy between this recent awareness and the number of modeling tools capable of quantifying this leeway in a spatially explicit integrated way is still missing. This thesis aims at bridging this gap. The outcome consists of a model that incorporates general equilibrium theory with an explicit representation of space at multiple scales. The model is designed as an autonomous numerical entity connectable to any pre-existing modeling architecture. This thesis hinges around three chapters, i.e. the presentation of the model, the calibration of the model and its application to France and the USA.In the first chapter, we describe our so-called GEMSE model whose aim is to investigate the interplays between aggregate and local dimensions of economic activity while quantifying GHG emissions associated to mobility. The model is based on Urban Economics and the New Economic Geography to model on multiple spatial scales the economic development of urban areas in interaction.In the second chapter, we describe the data and calibrate the model by using, for some parameters, spatial econometric techniques. Notably, we propose a new method to specify the spatial weight matrix, operationalized by using a numerical tool developed on purpose, namely PyOKNN, independent of GEMSE. Applied to Greater Paris, the tool identifies in a tangible way some key elements of its spatial structure, and yields values for the parameters under study that are similar to those of the literature.In the third chapter, we run simulations of our model for both France and the USA. We analyze the baseline case and the impacts of two transport policies on several relevant dimensions for the long-term development of urban areas. The first measure – the decrease in private vehicle speed limitation – stimulates economic activity in a pro-environmental fashion by contracting GDP in a first phase but then allowing it to reach higher levels, resulting in a positive sum game. The second measure is the implementation of a CO2 tax to private vehicles whose collected revenues are used to finance an increase in public transport speeds. The main policy insight is that setting a price of 100€ per tonne of CO2eq represents virtually nothing once converted per commuter-kilometer and deters only marginally the use of cars. These two measures, the change in speed limitation or the recycling of the tax, encourage the use of cheaper and less polluting modes of transport, which induces a low-carbon growth.Overall, these conclusions call for policy designs that internalize distortive effects, e.g. changes in mobility habits, the reorientation of demands, unbalances in labor markets via people’s relocations and firms’ improvements in terms of economies of scale. The results can rarely be generalized in terms of magnitude from one region to another, which shows the necessity to consider local specificities as well as the framework within which they interact"
"This thesis comes within the scope of the literature of modern and contemporary social justice theories, while focusing on the question of equality and the way it became a fundamental concern for these theories. Essentially relying on Amartya Sen’s, Emmanuel Levinas’ and GW.F. Hegel’s works, it suggests a conception of equality as the condition of possibility of justice, and thus of freedom, this one being assumed as the object of social justice. It also aims at foreseeing the limits of such a conception: the first chapter asserts the relation of interdependency that exists between the values of freedom and equality regarding distributive issues, by showing the necessity of a principle of equality through the argument of human reason. The second chapter deepens the argument of impartiality, as developed by Sen. From there, the third chapter deploys the necessity of an institutional mediation in the struggle for recognition, central to freedom issues, while showing the limits of the principle of equality. Finally, the last chapter, based on Levinas’ thought, displays the totalitarian drifts of equality, despite its practical necessity, thus insisting on the need of aVersion juillet 2016 3 / 2dialectical method to think of justice. Eventually, the main idea is to investigate the tension that seems to characterize social justice: justice cannot be reduced to equality, although it is assumed as one of its necessary conditions."
"Periods of deep risk aversion are usually marked by sizeable distortions in market prices, and substantial losses in portfolios. As observed during financial crises, a generalized debacle in financial markets is a very negative shock for the real economy. Against this backdrop, it looks relevant to explore how risk aversion tends to affect global market valuations, especially if this exercise helps make the promotion of more optimal portfolio rebalancing procedures.In this dissertation, we investigate different dimensions of risk aversion, with a focus on European Sovereign debt securities. For a given sovereign bond, the (quoted) yield to maturity has to reflect the underlying risk that the Treasury may default on its debt, before maturation of the bond. This is sovereign risk. Financial crises usually occasion an upward correction in bond yields. Since higher yields reflect larger sovereign risk and higher funding costs, national Treasuries are usually inclined to get a deeper understanding of how sovereign risk could evolve under the influence of fierce risk aversion. This is another objective of our research analysis.In Chapter I, we consider a probabilistic approach to sovereign risk exploration, with the main purpose of illustrating the non-linear reaction ensuing from a gradual deterioration in market sentiment. We consider heavy-tailed distributions, and we use the Generalised Autoregressive Score method as a means to capture the volatility momentum. The goodness of fit provided by Generalised Hyperbolic distributions is compelling, and results suggest that our approach is particularly relevant to fit periods or erratic volatility, typical of financial crises. As an attempt to simplify the model, we focus on an empirical formulation of the ‘untemporal’ volatility of each security. This estimator of the intrinsic volatility suggests that volatility tends to accelerate in a quadratic manner when it is expressed against the cumulative distribution function of the yield variations. In a second part, we extend this approach to a problem of larger dimension and we explore the dynamics of risk aversion from a bivariate point of view. Results look robust and illustrate multivariate correlations between sovereign securities. As a general conclusion, heavy-tailed distributions look remarkably efficient to replicate the distribution of times-series affected by distorted volatility and erratic price variations.Chapter II explores different ways to extract information from the model, about financial contagion and how it is supposed to propagate through sovereign securities. In particular, we explore the market reaction to a series of many shocks with gradual intensity. Results offer a high degree of granularity and we extrapolate empirical rules on the expected market dynamics, when risk aversion intensifies. Then we incorporate our estimators of volatility and market reaction (to shocks) into popular portfolio optimisation procedures and we see positive implications on the general resilience of these portfolios. Finally, we also design an in-house methodology for optimal portfolio rebalancing, based on mean reversion.In Chapter III, we explore how sovereign risk tends to affect the price of financial derivatives in a risk-off environment. We consider that risk aversion and the ensuing volatility now favour the emergence of sizeable discontinuities in market prices, that we model with stochastic jumps. The different approaches we investigate extensively rely on Hawkes processes. These stochastic processes seek to estimate the durable impact of risk aversion onto the dynamics of jumps, via the introduction of dedicated self-excited loops. We develop an original approach to the calibration, different from conventional procedures. In the end, the calculated implied volatility remains in the vicinity of the realised volatility and there is a visible capability to jump on any rise in risk aversion."
"The arbitrage between financial stability and the efficiency of banking systems has always been a key issue indefining the prudential regulation. This thesis analyses how this arbitrage is conceived and the extent to which itallows to reconcile the two objectives, namely the cost and the benefits of the new regulatory framework. We firstfocus on the impact of the new capital and liquidity requirements on the cost of capital and on banking activities. Ourfindings indicate that, globally, the cost of the recent reform is relatively low and does not have a significant impacton lending. We also emphasize a differentiated effect according to banks’ size, systemic importance and businessmodel. The existence of various distortions, affecting the pricing of risk, motivates the second part of the thesis, whichis dedicated to the analysis of implicit guarantees. We also assess the impact of resolution regimes and practices inending the too big to fail anomaly. Although ambitious measures have been undertaken, there is still a way to go toeliminate these distortions. In the third part, we examine the contribution of solvency and liquidity requirements tostrengthen the resilience of banks. The results indicate that setting up good incentives, through adequate prudentialstandards, could efficiently reduce financial risks (default probability, systemic risk, capital shortfall in case of adversescenario). The approach adopted in this thesis focuses on microeconomic aspects and is based on empirical studiesapplied to a sample of European banks."
"The experience of the “Great Recession” has led economists and policymakers to pay particular attention tofinancial stability. It also lead them to think how to get out of this recession, and particularly on the meansof financing the emergence of a new, more sustainable growth model. In this context, this thesis studies theinfluence of bank competition on stability and efficiency in order to shed light on the debate about the optimallevel of bank competition in Europe. For this purpose, we first study the effects of bank competition on financialinstability by focusing on the concept of systemic risk. This leads us to undertake two distinct studies: onefocusing on the distribution of systemic risk between financial institutions; the other on financial procyclicality.In both cases, we conclude that a positive link between competition and stability does exist.We then focus on thequestion of stability in terms of the effectiveness of the monetary stabilisation policy. In this respect, we show thatbank competition improves the efficiency of two channels of monetary transmission: the interest rate and thebank lending channels. Therefore, the lack of European banking integration, highlighted by the heterogeneity ofbank competition, is one factor that explains the fragmentation that can be observed in the Eurozone. Finally, weconsider the possibility that economic growth may be a function of bank competition. To do this, we first showhow competition could impact economic growth in theory, and find two opposing effects. We then demonstrateempirically that bank competition has negative effects on economic growth, in particular by decreasing totalfactor productivity growth. Our work hence supports the idea that stimulating competition leads to a trade-offbetween stability and efficiency."
"The Fukushima Dai Ichi nuclear accident was analysed in many publications. These studies followed classical approaches and focused on drawing lessons to improve nuclear facilities’ preventive measures. Therefore, the human aspect of the crisis management is not addressed enough.The hearings of the plant’s superintendent Yoshida by the Government’s inquiry Committee may help us tackle this issue. We consider that the transcriptions of the hearings are a life narrative of superintendent Yoshida. This narrative depicts his experience throughout an extreme situation. During four days, the workers around him dealt with extremely harsh conditions and had very limited resources available. Despite the threat to their physical, psychological and social integrity, they managed to overcome the hardship and prevented the worse from happening.Coping is a notion that refers to the specific efforts carried out to adjust to stressful situations. These efforts depend on the representation the individual forms of the situation. A qualitative study of Yoshida’s narrative allows us then to understand coping strategies carried out and the individual and contextual factors that came into play. We found that coping strategies were active after the arrival of the tsunami, but with the scarcity of resources and the impossibility to intervene on the reactors, Yoshida became more passive and began having morbid thoughts. As the crisis unfolded, anticipation and elaboration of alternative solutions left room to resignation.The narrative provides us technical and operational explanations, but Yoshida also describes emotional, cognitive and relational aspects of the crisis management. He pays tribute to the workers depicted as unsung heroes. The construction of his life narrative allows him to rehabilitate his collective of workers that took incredible risks to save Japan with very little support.Life narratives provide us with events as they have been experienced. They highlight the mechanisms that help organisations redefine their action in dangerous and urgent situations. Life narratives help us put the human back at the centre of accidents analyses."
"As automakers develop automated driving systems, they must address the implications of such systems on road safety. Notably for the safety benefit assessment, trial safety and accident analysis. However, the existing conceptual framework in road safety may not be adapted to analyze the changes and new interactions introduced by vehicle automation at all the levels of the road transport sociotechnical system.The main objective of this thesis is to apply a systems theoretic approach based on STAMP to examine the safety benefit assessment, trial safety and accident analysis of automated driving across all the levels of the road transport sociotechnical system.This research first contributes to safety benefit assessment by estimating the target population of a highway pilot system and by generating questions derived from an STPA analysis (hazard analysis based on STAMP) to facilitate the evaluation of the influence of the highway pilot system on road safety.Next, this work establishes a framework to ensure trial safety across the macroscopic and microscopic levels of the vehicle trial system by structuring the outputs of two STPA analyses.Finally, this thesis integrates elements from existing crash analysis methods and newly developed guidance elements into CAST (an accident analysis method based on STAMP) to develop a new method for the accident analysis of crashes involving automated driving called CASCAD. The application of CASCAD was illustrated using the available information of the Tesla crash on May 2016.The three applications of this research show the potential of a STAMP-based approach to provide a suitable conceptual framework for the analysis of the implications of road safety on automated driving."
"Successive evaluations of French Military hospitals by the Court of Auditors point out a sub-activity that generates a deficit. The French Military Health Care Service acknowledged these points but considers that military activities (in particular participation in External Operation), may explain, at least partly, the deficit and sub-activity mentioned by the Court of Auditors.This practical question feeds the theoretical reflection conducted in this thesis. A detailed description of external operations shows that they can be considered as soft projects. These projects are characterized by the progressive determination of their goals: that are not completely known when the project starts. The literature questions adequacy of project management standards to soft projects and the following research question emerges: what is the role of stakeholders’ engagement and planning flexibility in soft projects management?The thesis is based on an intervention research. A simulation is built to objectify external operations management in military hospitals. It highlights the impact of external operations on care production and consequently on hospitals ‘deficit. Two analyses are conducted to understand the causes of this impact. First, an analysis of the current planning process of external operations suggests that renewing planning methods can be necessary to offer a flexible planning based on cooperation. Second, the simulation reveals the important role of physicians and nurses’ commitment in managing external operations. This commitment, driven by strong relationships between project stakeholders, positively influences external operations’ outcomes.These observations allow theoretical progress on management tools for soft projects.Two concepts seem particularly suited to soft projects’ constraints: interactive planning developed in companies facing high uncertainties and relational contracting described by law and economics scholars. Interactive planning brings both flexibility and cooperation that appear decisive to build a response to soft goals. Relational contracts help understand how high commitment can bring simultaneously motivation and adaptability, that are both essential to achieve soft goals.To conclude, I suggest structuring projects’ space according to the degree of determination of projects’ goals and the degree of stakeholders’ engagement in the project. These dimensions allow defining areas where project management standards will be applicable and those where they might need to be adapted to soft projects. The diversity of soft projects (public sector, international development, organizational change) calls for such a structure that can facilitate the spread of specific management tools."
"Innovation processes of large companies experience a lack of resources between Research and Development, i.e. the valley of death. Safran created its Innovation Department to counterbalance. It is based on exchanges with the subsidiaries. However such exchanges cannot be processed in most early stages, when they include unknowns. For instance, ideas generated through the DKCP method remain unexplored. This intervention-research aims at establishing a model of collective action to exchange in the unknown. It defends the thesis that, in the unknown, sellers and buyers of innovative technologies engage in the design of the boundary between technologies and environments.Facing the limits of classic models of exchanges of economy, decision, intéressement and creativity, this thesis adopts a design-theories framework. It proposes the model of design engagement of resources. It explains the limits of a common tool for exchanging technologies, i.e. Technology Readiness Levels. It proposes to model exchanges between seller and buyer as the exploration of the Technology-Environment boundary. To do so it constructs the C-K T / C-K E formalism. Finally, the method Steering Exploration Through Technology and Environment Invariants (""Pilotage de l'Exploration Par les Invariants Technologie-Environnement"" (PEPITE) in French) is constructed in collaboration with Safran Innovation Department. It is based on two cases of explorations which passed the valley of death within the researchers intervention."
"During the last years, the finance industry has experienced a proliferation of innovations which may disrupt traditional financial services. They blur the boundaries between banks and financial start-ups, speed up transactions, democratize the access to credit, revise how we can purchase goods and how merchants can sell their products, while imposing regulators the challenge for a new level playing field which balances the trade-off between financial stability, competition and innovation. In this thesis, I try to answer to three main issues related to the topic of innovation in retail banking. Firstly, how do innovations impact competition in retail banking. One first issue is to understand why some of these innovative services are offered by non-bank platforms and how can banks compete with entrants that do not have the same business model. Secondly, I look at what the drivers of the adoption of innovation by consumers in retail banking are. What determines the diffusion of a new financial technology despite all the financial risks related to it ? To answer to these questions, I will look empirically at the example of the two main peer-to-peer lending platforms in the USA, Prosper and LendingClub. Third, I address the question on whether regulation of innovation is necessary. Is it optimal for the society to regulate the providers of innovative retail banking services? To answer to these questions, I address, in two theoretical models, the well-known debates on the optimal level of interchange fees in payment card systems and the imposition of exclusivity arrangements and price parity clauses in contracts between platforms and merchants."
"Since sustainable development has spread, management tools have been developed in companies in order to tackle this problem. For climate change, the goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To do that, carbon markets, carbon taxation and limits of emissions are traditional policy tools. Less known, carbon accounting has been developed in order to assess greenhouse gas emissions, make it visible and therefore to make it possible to reduce them. However carbon accounting’s effects remain mostly unknown. In this thesis, I address collective action problem around this tool in a managerial perspective. Therefore I tackle carbon accounting's performativity by analyzing hidden model which is embedded in it and by studying its managerial effects. My methodology rests upon a qualitative research by using case studies specifically. I explain first that there are different logics behind the common term “carbon accounting”: an engineering and a financial one. Managerial effects are also varied: a strategy oriented toward the emission reduction is sometimes settled but mostly other effects are created (claim for more and more transparency, etc.). Finally I propose theoretical contributions (performativity), empirical ones (ADEME and companies’ reflections) and methodological ones (performativity analysis through managerial tools)."
"The Linear Economy is structured on: extraction, production, product use and landfill. This model prevails although it is a threat to the preservation of natural resources. Whereas, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) constitute “Urban Mines” that are rich in valuable metals. Public policies from the 70s, based on regulatory constraints, have proved to be inefficient in instigating innovative and collective processes.In this thesis, we study an alternative approach based on the responsabilization of producers through co-regulated action between public and private actors. While responsibility is often linked to individualism, this work scrutinizes the substance of collective responsibility. Furthermore, in consideration of responsabilization as a mode of political governance, we examine the processes and the instruments which could be engaged to bestow collective responsibility on private actors.Through an exploratory, qualitative and longitudinal approach in the context of the WEEE sector, we propose new co-regulation principles. The research is based on the literature of the commons in which the conditions of a collective governance are discussed. The theoretical propositions are considered in the perspective of a comparative analysis at the European level."
"It is widely established that industrial innovation has to take into account imaginaries which could cause enthusiasme or rejection effects. That is why, nowadays designers consider them in their design processes. The traditionnal approach considers as stable as exogenous imaginaries, which could be shaped ex-ante and conformed new products and services to be designed. Could it be possible to plan a new approach, that would overpass the stability hypothesis, avoiding a kind of fixation and narrow-mindedness for designers or users ?The thesis focuses on this second approach, which endogenizes imaginaries by considering their renewal properties. It tackles three matters: how the transformation of imaginaries could account for the innovative technical object ? What an engineering system to stimulate imaginaries and feed innovation processes ? Lastly, what managerial actions to collectively support a stimulation of imaginaries, in an industrial context ?Thanks to the recent progress in design theory and empirical experiences led in the automotive industry, we could expand a modelisation effort. This work finds out three main results. Firstly, the thesis characterises the imaginaries dynamic transformation from a concrete and original technical object, by new criterias: heterogeneousness, number, tensions and non-polarity of imaginaries. Secondly, the thesis suggests a theoretical modelisation of the imaginaries expansion throughout a design process made of a knowledge structure with three logics hanging on together, based on the Lacanian approach and redefined by the design way: “real”, “symbolic” and “imaginary”. The thesis shows how to analyse empirical dynamics and set out managerial hypothesis in order to expand imaginaries. Thirdly, the experimentations led on four collective organisations of imaginaries, chosen for their complementarity, confirm, enrich and precise the hypothesis suggested by the theoretical model. It shows that the generativity of imaginaries is directly connected with their diversity and dynamism. Their transformation comes less from the injection of exogenous imaginaries than from a design effort combining with real, symbolic, and available substrates. Thanks to that, it is possible now to create an evolution on imaginaries through a stimulation organisation and a specific management to obtain strong generativity innovation processes."
"The Act of 8 April 1946 nationalized electricity in France and created a new public monopoly, Électricité de France. A small group of people, mainly from the corps des Ponts-et-Chaussées, was assembled to provide the public utility with a pricing policy. Marcel Boiteux, Gabriel Dessus et Pierre Massé, to mention only a few names, thought they would apply to the power sector the best economic theory of their time, Maurice Allais’ théorie du rendement social. The theory claimed that marginal cost pricing would bring the power sector to a state of maximum efficiency, that it would help governing the sector according to the public interest, and solve rationally the issue of nationalization and its aims. But the story turned out to be quite different. Pricing electricity did not mean applying to the sector the laws of efficiency through transfers of necessities. Rather, in a tentative, partial, progressive, often contradictory manner, the work allowed to describe and thus discuss possible exploitation projects. I propose to term this process the formulation of the optimum. Identifying such a process, I suggest, might contribute to the debate on the status of economics, the kind of truth it produces, and what we can expect from it, especially when it is closely associated with political decision making."
"Motivated by the conviction that economics and sociology must combine, our research has two goals. It questions theoretical filiations (or conceptual migrations) between economics and sociology on the one hand ; and analyzes the characteristics of these theoretical filiations on the other hand. Even though the dialogue between economics and sociology has been improving since the1960s, we question whether theoretical filiations between both disciplines are possible ; as well as the nature of the characteristics ? Our research is based on a case study, the theory of action. More specifically, we discuss different objects of this vast theory: the rational choice theory, the field of économie des conventions and the concept of embeddedness. The study reveals that theoretical filiations between economics and sociology are possible, unsystematic and can be considered as « imperfect »."
"The objective of this thesis was to understand the economic behavior of fisheries and to propose resource management policies. The focus was mainly on the French Guiana shrimp fishery. First an initial analysis will be performed on a historical data basis. Initial findings have showed that this fishery was characterized by a strong decrease in its stock, its effort, its production and lead to the closure of some companies. The results have helped also to understand that the production in this fishery is highly dependent on stock and the decrease of the stock is not related to overfishing. Indeed, despite a considerable decline in fishing effort and production, the stock continued to slump suggesting that other factors may be involved. In particular the fishing zone is characterized by an Amazonian environment with significant mangrove and many rivers. The integration of mangrove in the analysis, which shows a decrease in its surface in the 90s did not explain the collapse of the stock. However, the integration of other factors such as rivers and sea surface temperatures have increased understanding of stock depletion in this sector. The French Guiana shrimp fishery is highly influenced by global change, notably increasing in temperature. Moreover, the last chapter suggests that some endogenous phenomena in the fishery, like the congestion effects between fishing vessels, make the whole fishery more sensitive to technology, exogenous economic or biological shocks, amplifying their impact on the optimal business decisions regarding fishing effort. In order to save the French Guiana shrimp fishery, it appears therefore crucial to try to limit the sources of climate change instead of deeply modifying economic practices in this sector, which may lead to misunderstandings by fishermen and local political conflicts."
"In this thesis, we discuss the relationship between exports and FDI, and we aim to find a long-term relationship between these variables. In the course of the thesis analysis, we study empirically the exports and FDI determinants, at macro and micro analysis. This allows us to detect precisely the relationship between the both variables. In other words, this thesis carry out the following points: at micro level (company level), the multinationals are likely to implement the two activities (exports and FDI) to serve the foreign market, but the multinationals strategic choice can also choose between exports and FDI. On this point, the productivity of the multinational corporations and their other characteristics have a crucial role to clarify the mechanism of the choice between strategies and the relationship between exports and FDI. In fact, this is the first empirical part, which is the first similar application on the French companies. In the part, we also distinguish between strategic decisions based on company on the company size (large, very large and both groups of French enterprises).At the macro level, we will seek to identify the simultaneous determinants of exports and FDI. To do so, a gravity system is estimated bivariate dynamic equations to illuminate the role of these determinants and the relationship between exports and FDI. This is the second empirical part, which is applied on the capital and goods exchange between France and ten Mediterranean partners. The choice of these countries based on their importance in French trade. Moreover, the lack of the literature applied to these countries in this area is extra motivation."
"The aim of the thesis is to analyze financial instability. This latter is explained by its link with the cycle and the relation between the monetary policy and the banking sector. We highlight new transmission mechanisms of the monetary policy, especially the risk taking channel and the bank capital channel. The principal idea of the thesis is an eviction of the productive credit in good and bad times. After a survey, we build a theoretical model to capture the reaction of the banking sector during the cycle."
"The low volatility observed during the global financial crises and the importance of externalities on simulating host economies attribute considerable interest to foreign direct investment especially for developing countries (DCs). Therefore, the territorial attractiveness became the main priority for DCs’s policies towards more international openness. This explains the multitude of structural reforms and attractive strategies adopted by these economies over the last two decades. The contribution of this thesis is based on the analysis of FDI determinants at the macroeconomic and mesoeconomic level. The first study estimates the territorial attractiveness of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). We have applied the new contributions of the spatial econometric specification to examine the bilateral flows from 16 OECD countries to eight MENA countries over the period 1985-2010. The purpose is to jointly evaluating the spatial interregional contribution to explain  the  nature  of  FDI  present  in  the  region  and  the  role  of  the  spatial  intraregional autocorrelation to promote investment in the studied areas. The second study proceeds to analyze the specificity of Moroccan investment climate subject of this research. It consists to compare different economic sectors by identifying the significance of the FDI determinants in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. Thus, we estimate the impact of macroeconomic variables on FDI inflows within nine sectors. Thereafter, three institutional variables are individually incorporated to approximate the various elasticities of the legal and administrative climate on FDI attractiveness."
"The purpose of this thesis is to study the relationship between financial integration, political openness and growth in developing countries. In fact, political reforms and financial liberalization was the slogan of the international financial institutions which conditioned the granting of financial aid to the implementation of certain reforms in favor of democracy and more respect of human rights in addition to more financial integration. Our empirical investigation covers a sample of 108 developing countries between 1984 and 2008 and uses both static and dynamic panel data estimation in addition to the new causality test in heterogeneous panel. Our results show that financial liberalization positively impact growth directly and through indirect channel like Investment, trade and macroeconomic stability. It also favors financial development and promotes human capital. Even though, democracy doesn’t directly influence growth, it has an indirect positive effect on it through favoring international trade in addition to financial and human capital development. Otherwise, political instability negatively affects growth directly but also indirectly through decreasing investment and increasing inflation. Finally, our results suggest the existence of a bidirectional relationship between financial integration and democracy. In the other side, the relationship between financial integration and political stability is more specific and depend upon regionals characteristics of the country."
"The objective of this work is to analyze the determinants of inequalities in the school performance of 56 392 pupils at the end of primary school in 2 603 schools located in 647 districts in 12 countries of Eastern and Southern Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Swa-ziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe) based on the third 2007 Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ III) survey. The work is struc-tured around three chapters. The first chapter studies the influence of individual characteristics of the student and the school on school performance, as well as the important role of regional characteristics. In the second chapter, we seek to analyze how the inspection of schools and their accessibility by students a˙ect the eÿciency of schools. The last chapter proposes to study the socio-economic factors and schooling conditions a˙ecting performance and inequalities in access between girls and boys, taking into account their socio-economic backgrounds. To do this, we used di˙erent econometric approaches, namely a multilevel model in the first chapter, a non-parametric frontier model in chapter two, and a spatial econometric model in chapter three. The results show that the achievements of pupils, the eÿciency of institutions and inequality in access to school between girls and boys are highly heterogeneous in Southern and Eastern Africa. The results also indicate that the students who registered relatively high scores are located in rich urban areas with access to the means of transportation. Moroever, deep inequalities in schooling exist due to deficiency of transportation, road infrastructure, educational and health conditions particularly in districts located in rural areas and in poor neighborhoods in large cities. We also show that the variables a˙ecting school inspection missions, the use of the teaching langage at home and security of the school environment play an important role in student success."
"The instability and lack of regulation that originated the cyclical financial crises were factors conducive to questioning the ethics of finance. This thesis proposes first to question the epistemology of ""Financial science"" and its normative attributes. This question allows us to highlight the logical interconnections that exist between positivist and normative approaches before proposing a mapping of ethical reference shaping financial decisions. This theoretical work prefigures the empirical questions developed in the second part of the thesis. In this part, we confront two distinct ethical and financial practices: Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) and Shariah-Compliant Investment (SCI). Our studies identify their distinguishing features and the possible links between them. In the first study, after taking into account the stochastic profile of 24 domestic indexes we measure and identify the origin of their respective performance. The results confirm the resilience of SCI indexes during the subprimes crisis, while emphasizing the influence of the level of development and integration of stock markets. The second empirical study explores the causal link between the SCI and SRI criteria by investigating the relationship between Companies Social Performance (CSP) and its debt structure. The results obtained from a sample of 1,745 US companies indicate that only small and strictly controversial firms (not engaged in any CSR policy) have a significant higher leverage, therefore suggesting that these firms are more likely to be excluded from SCI portfolios. The last study measures, through an experimental approach, the financial impact of the combination of SRI and SCI criteria. Contrary to predictions suggested by modern portfolio theory, the results indicate no negative effect on performance due to the joint application of Islamic and ESG filters."
"This thesis proposes to study the evolution of city hierarchies and urban growth based on the case of Morocco. This country has experienced in recent decades a sustained urbanization process, both in large cities and small and medium-sized cities. Hence the need to proceed to a primatial urban demographic structure that requires coordination between certain national economic policies and planning policies carried out by major cities to be truly effective. A development policy resolutely turned so far towards the management of urban pressure in major cities. This led to a polarization of activities in some regions of the territory. Thus, this thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter examines the rank-size law and the contribution of economists and geographers in this process. The second chapter analyzes the three theoretical approaches that deal with the issue of urban growth, in particular theories of random growth, deterministic growth and the intersection of these two approaches, called hybrid. Finally, the last chapter is based on an empirical study at the regional level to identify the determinants of urban growth in Moroccan regions. The work undertaken in this thesis is based on original databases provided by the Office of the “Haut-Commissariat au Plan” to identify the size of Moroccan agglomerations and uses a set of statistical and econometric instruments. The various results obtained are a continuation of various studies carried out in regional sciences. These results indicate that Moroccan urban hierarchies are destined to change in the decades to come, but also that the economic growth of the regions of Morocco does not immediately affect the growth of the urban population."
"This thesis seeks to deepen the nature and the shape of the relationships between educational inequalities and development. It goes along with the prolongation of the analyses undertaken about the relationships between both education & growth; and inequality & growth, by trying to shed additional light on these two. It aims to retrace, in a schematic way, the evolution of educational inequalities particularly in the developing countries; and also to characterize the nonlinearity of this link using nonparametric and semiparametric estimation models.This thesis consists of three chapters that correspond to specific objectives, databases and methodologies.  In the first chapter, we propose a new dataset on the inequalities of education. Most of the studies on the relationship between human capital and economic development have mainly apprehended the measurement of human capital through quantitative education indicators, using namely the average of years of schooling (human capital stock). Our database, which presents an alternative measure of human capital, tends to improve significantly the way in which inequalities in education are calculated. It employs all the abundance of disaggregated data, corrects inappropriate weightings and refines some reductive assumptions about the durations of schooling cycles and the levels of education. We have also generalized the formula proposed by Berthélemy (2006) on the Gini index of education. The possible variation range of this index is graphically identified according to the average years of schooling and the cumulative duration of the schooling cycles. In Chapter II, we reveal the existence of a nonlinear relationship between inequalities in education and economic development using nonparametric and semiparametric models that do not require predefined functional forms. Several phases are therefore highlighted: the first three are identified only according to the level of development; then two other phases are recognized by combining thresholds of both development and education inequality; the sixth and final phase is defined by the educational inequality level alone. We show that the phases during which the reduction of educational inequality presents the most beneficial impact on economic development are the third and the fifth.Beyond the general outline highlighted at the transnational level in Chapters I and II, we explore in Chapter III the nature of this relationship at the regional level in the case of Morocco, for which we have data at both the municipal and provincial levels. We also confirm the nonlinearity of the relationship. The third phase, identified in Chapter II, is divided to two sub-phases in the case of the Moroccan provinces which have a differentiated impact according to a threshold of development and inequality of education."
"The relationship between human capital and employability is clearly demonstrated by the review of the theoretical literature however, not always verified empirically. We can thus see a paradox of education in MENA countries where the unemployment rate increases with the degree and where participation rates and especially female activity rates are low. So we’re looking through three empirical studies to bring out the elements that can upset the relationship between accumulation of human capital and employability. First we bring your attention to Tunisia and Morocco where university graduates unemployment rate is particularly important. We lead initially macroeconomic analysis for these countries before leading a microeconomic analysis by focusing on the region of Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz where we analyze the relationship between the level of education and access to paid employment. Our second study is positioned on the French labor market where we analyze the access of employment and the wage differential to determine whether the existence of “discriminations” can upset the relationship between human capital and employability. Finally, our third full study our previous approach regarding access to employment, taking into account the educational pathways of young people and not the highest degree obtained"
"To communicate effectively, marketers need to know the process according to which consumers perceive and choose brands. Within these processes, consumer certainty plays an important role, particularly in the determinacy of product items. In this thesis, this role is analyzed through a variable that globalization contributes both to distort and amplify: brand's nationality. Data analysis and statistics indicates: The « mediating » effect of attitude toward the brand, which indicates ""how"" the country's image and certainty can influence consumer purchase intentions, The « moderating » effect of certainty of belief, which indicates ""When"" consumers can use an image of the « country of origin » in a decision process. Managerial and theoretical implications are discussed, so that managers can monitor the nationality associated with their brands and avoid negative effects for the company."
"The role of banks in the economy is very important to be a central pillar of the national economy, and therefore, one of their major objectives must be to serve the community in which they operate, fund and encourage investment to create wealth.Given the importance of this sector, it is necessary to measure its performance, evaluate its effectiveness and to test the quality of its services, in order to improve and develop. Our research aims to test the effect of cultural factors of the society in the quality of banking services from the perspective of customers."
"How are some illegal practices sustained? Prior studies have depicted how marginal, illegitimate or illicit practices could be integrated to the market. However, their sustainability is understudied in consumer research.Drawing on Neo Institutional Theory, our main purpose in this research is to understand how ordinary consumers and materiality through institutional work sustain an illegal practice. By examining the case of illegal downloading in France from 2008 to 2013, and a qualitative method, based on interviews and secondary data, we show how artefacts are enabling the illegal practice and shape the consumption of pirated content.Results expose how an illegal practice is institutionalized through materiality. Our main contribution is to bring an understanding on how materiality may destabilize an institutional order. We offer also some managerial implications regarding the legal offer of digitalized contents."
"The purpose of this research is to understand how the tourist uses his smartphone to discover a tourist destina- tion. We develop and test a model of use-diffusion of smartphone .We identify three categories of mobile services uses, orientation, organization and search for information located (SMOORIL). The model considers four deter- minants related to the personal characteristics of the tourist and 3 determinants related to the context of use. The consequences of these practices are identified for tourist experience and satisfaction with these services. The re- lationships between variables were examined using a structural equation modeling. Results of this research show that SMOORIL uses are mainly explained by smartphone daily uses. Need to disconnect has no effect on this kind of use. Also, if SMOORIL uses have a positive effect on tourism experience, the fact that tourists perceive effect of these practices on social dimension of tourism experience negatively affect satisfaction with SMOORIL. From a conceptual point of view, this work proposes a framework to analyzing relationships between virtual and physical consumer behavior. From a theoretical perspective, this research shows importance of studying uses to understand how the consumer uses smartphone to discover geographical space. Finally, this research invites professionals to reflect on the relevance of offer mobile services to tourists according to type of experience(s) offered by the destination."
"This thesis examines the role of service appropriation and client participation in the value co-creation mechanism in services. First, an exploratory study in the health sector aimed to propose a comprehensive framework for service appropriation and analysed the process of value co-creation from a ""customer centric"" perspective. Second, a quantitative study was conducted with 508 diabetics patients. The results highlight the impact of service appropriation on value formation and on client participation. This research may contribute to the theory of value co-creation by proposing a modelization of its mechanisms. Plus, it gives clues to deepen the understanding of the concept of appropriation in marketing. Finally, this study provides important insights into how service providers and managers should manage the appropriation of their services and engage customers in the value co-creation process."
"AWith the resurgence of design customization, the consumer tends to choose a design whose personality is in line with his personality or which values its personality. Due to the ubiquity of design and increased competition, it becomes increasingly complex for the manager to differentiate his design and its acceptance by the target through effective communications. Thus the implementation of the knowledge of the personality of the design, its structure and factors of diffusion / adoption, can assist in making effective decisions and then consumer satisfaction. The purpose of this research is to propose a concept of the personality of the design, a hierarchical structure of the personality of the design and the factors favorising its diffusion / adoption. Indeed, the legitimacy of the approach is motivated by the anthropomorphism of design, the metaphor of the design and use of the human personality adjectives to describe the design. In an Italian context, the study is based on a convenience sample of four designs and processes (Mercedes, Coco Cola, Adidas Porsche and McDonald's). Factors analyzes were used to highlight a personality structure design composed of dimensions, factors and features. Infact, several analyzes demonstrate the strong predictive power and differentiator barometer of the personality of the design. Furthermore, the results show that the diffusion / adoption of the personality of the design is subject to a Mix composed of the perception of personality, communication channels and factors related to the individual. Thus, from an operational point of view, these tools could be very relevant to the diffusional, strategic and operational management of the design on its overall strategy."
"Food waste occupies a growing space in news and political agenda. Yet, studies on food waste are still relatively rare in marketing science, and they do not take into account the way consumers are concerned by food waste. In this work, we propose a definition of consumer's concern for food waste (CCFW) and, we validate a measuring scale for this construct. Then, we test a modeldescribing the relationships between concern for food waste (CFW), its antecedents and, behaviors linked with food waste at home. Quantitative analysis reveals a two-dimensional concern. The first dimension is ""individual"" (close to the person) and the second one is more ""global"" (general). Individual concern has a stronger impact on the adoption of waste-reducing practices than global concern. Education received regarding food waste and “concern for purchasing power” are, as expected, antecedents of CCFW. Finally, we give recommendations for governments, consumers and managers, in the light of these results, to help reducing food waste."
"Food waste occupies a growing space in news and political agenda. Yet, studies on food waste are still relatively rare in marketing science, and they do not take into account the way consumers are concerned by food waste. In this work, we propose a definition of consumer's concern for food waste (CCFW) and, we validate a measuring scale for this construct. Then, we test a modeldescribing the relationships between concern for food waste (CFW), its antecedents and, behaviors linked with food waste at home. Quantitative analysis reveals a two-dimensional concern. The first dimension is ""individual"" (close to the person) and the second one is more ""global"" (general). Individual concern has a stronger impact on the adoption of waste-reducing practices than global concern. Education received regarding food waste and “concern for purchasing power” are, as expected, antecedents of CCFW. Finally, we give recommendations for governments, consumers and managers, in the light of these results, to help reducing food waste."
"This research seeks to analyze the phenomenon of environmental advertising contestation. In effect, there is a shortage of studies on these issues. The objective of this thesis is to explore the contours of the environmental advertising contestation concept while identifying the reasons, the manifestations and the risks associated with it. Three empirical studies, one qualitative and two experimental, show that that there are reasons of contestation related to creative elements of advertisement and discourse advertisements and others linked to advertising medium and confidence of consumer toward the advertising source. Moreover, the manifestations of contestation can range from collective and visible movements to more individual behaviors such as avoidance and the rejection of environmental advertising. In addition, the contestation seems to have a negative impact on consumer buying behavior and on the firm's image. Finally, the results indicate that provocation- a tool used by companies according to literature to avoid contestation- has negative effects on consumers‘ perceptions and attitudes toward the advertisement. In the light of the obtained results, the limitations of the thesis are outlined and future avenues of research are proposed."
"The role of the sales restrictions on the evaluation of the offer and the intention of purchase still stays controversial. The marketing literature is divided over the subject and sets up different conceptual frames and theories explaining the effects of these restrictions. Facing the lack of unanimity in literature, in a context where the rentability of sales promotions is not established, this thesis aims to a better comprehension of the impact of the temporal limits on the evaluation of a promotional sales offer and the intention of the consumer's purchase. This survey was made through a mixed methodology made by an exploratoring study lead by focus groups and by a quantitative study lead by the scanario method. The results of our explorating survey underline an ambivalent behaviour versus the temporal restriction of sales. Our empiric study reveals a moderating role of the brand able to limit the perception of the drawbacks in the space of the time restrictions of sales."
"For the last years, the consistent development of store brands or private labels has resulted in a market composed of three segments: customers who are national brand loyal, (ii) store brand loyal and (iii) those who combine store and national brands. So the question becomes: why does the latter group of consumers migrate from a national brand to a store brand and vice versa? To our knowledge, no study has been conducted about this aspect of national brand and private label competition. The research in marketing has mainly studied brand switching between national brands and the choice of store brand. However, migration between the two types of brand might account for up to 20% of the purchase behaviours (source: MarketingScan panel). The purpose of this dissertation is to suggest a theoretical framework to understand the migration between the two types of brands. We analyzed the influence of variables at the brand and SKU, and product category levels, while accounting for the (observed and unobserved) individual and store specific factors. Our empirical analysis is based on the panel data from MarketingScan. We developed a Latent Factor Random Coefficients Multinomial Logistic Model that allows us to control for unobserved heterogeneity. We showed that the type of store brand had an influence on both the migration and the behavioural loyalty to store brand. The price is still important in the competition between private labels and national brands. Greater availability of SKUs at the brand level promotes migration to store brands, which helps them capture additional purchases. Nevertheless, a strong presence of private labels in a product category reduces consumer satisfaction with the assortment and consequently causes households to migrate to national brands."

"In an increasingly competitive advertising context, the race for originality among advertisers have positioned humor as a determinant tool. Indeed, as the media offer is growing (television, radio, e-advertising, billboards, street marketing, etc). There is a proliferation of humorous and offbeat advertising campaigns. Preventive communications, which generally use persuasive techniques for advertising, are turning more and more to humor. Indeed, humor have been proved to be efficient in terms of persuasion and could thus present some advantages in preventive communications. It could notably 1) offer new opportunities to catch the public attention with a new effect, different from the ones used by traditional preventive communications (fear, shame or guilt appeal) and 2) avoid disinterest of people to preventive communication involving negative emotions. Consequently, this research aims to better understand the use of humor in preventive communication and to identify the conditions to ensure its effectiveness. This thesis pursues a first theoretical objective: to shed light on the concept of humor and its implementation in communication. An experimental study on 300 people, in the context of the overweight and obesity prevention, was conducted to test several preventive communications using different types of humor. The objectives are the following: 1) to ensure the effectiveness of a persuasive preventive communication about overweight and obesity using humor, 2) examining the effects of different types of humor on this effectiveness and 3) to study the process of influence (cognitive and affective) and the conditions of efficiency of humor by identifying mediating and moderating variables (in particular the role of individual variables such as self-esteem, perceived body and body satisfaction)."
"Since the early 2000s, the development of genomics, which enables extensive knowledge of the DNA of living entities, has transformed the way in which living entities are evaluated, selected (genomic selection of plants and animals) and marketed. Coupled with political and regulatory changes, this technology contributes to modify the national institutional arrangements in the targeted field of animal genetic improvement, practices of actors. The current liberalization process questions both the collective dimension of genetic progress and the property rights of the genetic resources. In a comparative perspective between France, Ireland and The Netherlands, the objective of this thesis is to analyze the plurality of institutional arrangements pertaining to the Holstein cattle breed’s genomic selection. This thesis is situated within the recent evolutions of the neo-institutional theory focused on organizational heterogeneity and materiality of institutions. Firstly, it highlights three institutional regimes that reveal different arrangements particularly between public and private organizations. Secondly, this diversity of arrangements is completed by an analysis of contractual tools between breeding companies and animal breeders through models of production strategies and exchanges related to genetic resources (both biological and informational forms). These models emphasize a variety of property forms of genetic resources between companies and breeders and also show that actors’ roles in genetic selection activities are redefined. These results provide a better understanding of the development of a liberal logic (The Netherlands) in duality with the reinforcement (Ireland) or weakening (France) of a cooperative logic for the production of improved animal genetics."
"Climate change and variability is the most widespread anthropogenic challenge affecting agricultural production and productivity particularly in the tropics. Coffee sector is sensitive to climate change as it requires relatively cold temperature and higher rainfall duration.  Adaptation to climate change in the coffee agroforestry is, therefore, important to address the impacts, but there are barriers, and limits. The aim of this Thesis was to analyze the adaptation strategies to climate change in Central Kenya. We studied the steps in adaptation, which includes (1) the knowledge on climate change and adaptation, the motivation towards adaptation, (2) current choices of households’ adaptation strategies, and their determinants, (3) the roles of innovation system and institutional context to support adaptation. This study was based on four sources of information: - (1) Focus Group Discussions to predefine the questionnaires, (2) household surveys, (3) stakeholders interview, and, (4) historical climate data. The data collection considered four farming typologies; - food crops, specialized coffee, diversified coffee-dairy and specialized dairy farming systems in the coffee and food crops zones. Mann-Kendal trend analysis and Sen’s slope estimator were used to compare the farmers’ knowledge of climate change with the historical climate data, while Heckman model was used to analyze adaptation strategies and their determinants. The findings explore consistent results between farmers’ knowledge and historical data analysis for temperature, while inconsistency is observed in rainfall change. Analysis of farmers’ perception revealed rainfall is radically declining over time, while no evidence in rainfall record is found to support the farmers’ perception. The inconsistency is therefore, substantiated with analysis of patterns. Coffee and food crop farmers are found to adapt to climate change differently. Farmers who are aware of the changes are found more willing to explore adaptation strategies although some of the farmers who do not perceive the climate is changing are also adopting strategies for factors other than perception. The comparison between coffee and dairy sectors found that actors in the coffee are limited, the system is highly centralized with limited options for farmers to process and market their products, while the dairy sector is informally controlled by demand based business and comparatively,  numerous actors. We conclude in this study that the patterns in rainfall affects the farming activities of the study area higher than the annual changes. Consequently, farmers adopt a series of adaptation strategies in response to their perception of changes in climate and economic pressure in the farm. This adaptation to climate change also depends on the nature of actors’ interaction and institutional context. In relation to policy development, this Thesis contributes to household level adaptation policies, research policies and international agreements and negotiations. The household level policy recommendations consists of three scenarios. Farmers’ intensification in coffee applying the right technological innovations. The second and third policy options are the diversification to dairy and complete sectoral transformation to dairy depending on the profitability and adaptation level of the sectors. The results in this study are derived from surveys and analysis of innovation systems. Other strategies such as new infrastructural development and institutional subsidies could be potential for adaptation. We therefore, recommend, these could be potential future research topics."
"Over the last decade, forms of voluntary consumer work have emerged in different areas (transport, accommodation, repair, etc.). They lead to a shift from a consumer ""served"" by the market to an ""auto-produced"" consumer.This Phd thesis is based on the study of a form of organization part of this movement, through the realization of a longitudinal study of the creation and launch of a cooperative and participatory supermarket, La Louve. This non-profit project proposes to offer quality food products at low cost. The work of its members is at the heart of the organizational and economic model of the cooperative, each consumer member having to provide 3 hours of work per month.Through this research, the acceptance of consumer participation in marketing, of working consumers (Dujarier, 2010), of voluntary work and of alternative are shaken. The thesis identifies a new form of work carried out by consumer-volunteers who self-assign the demands of professionals. It highlights the emergence of an organizational form supported by an alternative and responsible discourse, but whose management practices remain anchored in a pragmatic and non-militant approach. This collective of consumers reveals a utopian and pragmatist approach, the cooperators agreeing to provide free work by reproducing the salaried model of the companies and put into practice their skills to first meet their own needs.From this research, a new register of meaning emerges, that of a consumer working in a voluntary way characterized by his commitment without militancy and limited by a contract of voluntary work."
"In this thesis, we have provided a complete review of the semantic web technologies and their corresponding utility in the current environment for small to medium sized enterprise (MSE). The traditional approaches to enterprise integration favour large enterprise entities and force contractual limitations on smaller partners, but at the same time the pressure to guard the individual enterprise competence is ever increasing, the distributed enterprise (MSE) in such an environment have limited number of choices, which forces them to make strategic decisions and enter into a long term agreements with their partners and this limits their flexibility to the market changes. We, in this thesis, propose a semantic web based ontology approach for integrating the information as well as physical resource of the distributed enterprise. This web based approach acts as a decision support for better resources utility as well as distributed information integration. The work related to web ontology?s for information integration is not new, but the approach proposed in this thesis for distributed enterprise is an added value. Similarly, we have also proposed semantic web ontology as a configuration system to manage the distributed resources of the virtual enterprise, for this we have modelled OWL-DL ontology on the semantic of the industrial integration standard ISA-95, and subsequently used this ontology artefact as a configuration artefact to manage the distributed virtual enterprise material and equipment resources this is the main proposition of the thesis of utilizing semantic web ontology as resource configuration decision support"
"We treat in this thesis the integration problem between the various components of the industrial magnagement which are maintenance (preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, etc...), production (quantities to produce, stockpile size, etc...) And quality (rejection rate, non-compliances, etc...). To develop such integrated models production-maintenance -Quality, two complementary approaches are adopted, the first is based on mathematical modelling and the second one uses simulation. As a first step, we propose to solve malthematically the problem od dimensioning the size to be produced for a production system that can randomly move to an out of control statue and produce non-conforming units. The system is subjected to an age preventive maintenance policy. Once the transistiion to the state out of control is detected , a restouration of the system is planned for L time units later. A mathematical model was developed to determine the quantity Q of economic production and the age T for preventive maintenance. In a second step, we have developed a joint policy of preventive maintenance and quality control for a production system that can generate conforming and nonconforming units. For the modelling of these strategies, we used two different approaches : the first uses only analytical tool and the second uses the analytical tools and simulation. Each of the strategies proposed is based on a predictive maintenance policy. According to the rate of nonconforming units generared by the machine, one decides on the modelling of these strategies, suppose thar after having undergonemaintenance actions ( preventive maintenance or revivsion), the systeme returned to its original condition (AS GOOD AS NEW), In another approach based on simulation, we propose to relax this assumption and assume that the system returned to its original state only after the overhaul actions. After having undergone the preventive maintenance actions, the systems is in a state between i its initial state just before the stop (between AS GOOD AS NEW and AS BAD AS OLD)."
"This thesis deals mainly with makespan minimization in Flow-Shop and hybrid Flow-Shop scheduling problems where mixed blocking constraints are considered. In Flow-Shop scheduling problem, a set of N jobs must be executed on a set of M machines. All jobs require the same operation order that must be executed according to the same manufacturing process. Each machine can only execute one job at any time. Pre-emptive operation is not authorized in presented work. In case of hybrid Flow-Shop, at any processing stage k, there exist one or more identical machines Mk. Objective function consists in determining best schedule in order to reduce makespan, i.e. time where all operations are completed. The most common scheduling problem is classical flowshop where buffer space capacity between machines is considered as unlimited. Other problems are characterized by the fact that the storage capacity is limited or null and which generates one blocking constraint. This constraint can be a classical blocking (RSb) or particular blocking (RCb or RCb*). In our works, we present a general case which can be derived from industry and modeled as Flow-Shop and hybrid Flow-Shop systems subject simultaneously to different blocking. To solve these problems, we studied in this thesis complexity of these systems and we proposed exact methods, approached methods and lower bounds"
"Motivated by the change of regulations in the matter of sustainability, but also by pure economic constraints, several industries have found themselves obligated to develop new methods and models for the management of products that are at the end of their life cycle. In this context, the remanufacturing aims at managing the recovery of the product’s value before its end of life. This type of action will extend the product life cycle and save the use of the raw material. These remanufactured products will be re-injected in a market that serves another class of customers, different from the one using new products. In other cases, the remanufactured products are reused as spare parts for the maintenance, but this reuse may vary according to the maintenance strategy adopted. This thesis focuses on the integration of a hybrid flow supply of spare parts in a service model based on stochastic degradation of a production system. Two types of spare parts supply flows are studied: a direct flow and reverse flow. The direct flow is represented by the use of new spare parts and the reverse flow is represented by the reuse of the recovered parts during the replacements, with the ability to perform remanufacturing action to improve the degradation level of these spare parts. Several issues were treated to better understand the impact of remanufacturing policies over the performance of a production system. At the beginning we started our study with production systems composed of a single machine. In this context, we proposed sequential studies then integrated one to optimize the maintenance policy as well as the Hybrid provisioning in regard to spare parts destined to replacement actions. Similarly, we’ve studied the production management subjected to quality constraint based on the machine’s degradation process. Furthermore, we’ve presented generalizations of studied models within the context of a production system composed of several machines. Finally, we’ve developed an aid-to-decision-design tool for production systems within the remanufacturing process. This problematic aims at –from a strategic point- selecting the best group of machines to build a new system of production that is able to satisfy the constraints of a production defined by the decision maker"
"Through our research, we offer a support tool for the managers in Robert Pax hospital in Sarreguemine (France), and more generally any hospital center wishing to develop a patient centered approach. We were inspired by « product centered » approaches emerging from industrial domain which were proposed to answer the increasing requirements of products management. By analogy, health care systems patient centered can be assimilated to production systems product centered. However, it is important not to lose sight of the specificities of health care systems which is the human factor. This specificity makes this system complex, random and unpredictable. Besides, the approaches used in industrial or hospital environment, are mainly mathematical models and simulation approaches centered on one ore several resources categorized as critical. In that sense, it seemed judicious to choose a patient centered approach based on a multi-agent paradigm. We proposed a Reactive multi-agent control system of the patient flow in healthcare system. The proposed alternative is a patient centered approach allowing to minimize the patients waiting time and the length of their stay and consequently the care costs. The proposed approach also ensures the care quality and an optimal use of the hospital resources"
"This thesis analyzes the economic and social impacts of the marketization health car system in Djibouti. Since the late 1970s, all developed countries and developing, although with health systems based on the principles and different institutional arrangements (forms of financing, degrees of decentralization, availability of resources, etc...), are faced with the same problem : finance in a period of slower growth, a highly inflationary health sector. Therefore, the majority of countries have implemented reforms to their health care system. Developed countries mainly proposed ad hoc measures, often dictated by the need to balance health accounts. However, the measures proposed by developing countries are moving towards reforms. Under pressure from international financial organizations in particular, developing countries will change their health system to a disengagement of the State. The results of this thesis clearly show that in Djibouti, even if the transfer of ownership which corresponds strictly to privatization is rare in the health sector, public ownership of health care facilities shall not relieve the people of the care expenses. The downward trend of state subsidies, for public institutions of care and greater financial autonomy granted to them often leads to intervene in the market as a business selling services products. This makes the mostly requested health services unaffordable for the majority of the people. The expected benefit of the marketization of the health system, is however, affected by Djibouti the low contributory capacity of households."
"This thesis fills the gap in the research on the discovery of the macroeconomic and financial determinants of fine-wine prices. As a first step, a literature review presents main academic contributions on wine pricing. Complementary to the hedonic pricing approach, it is necessary to study the impact of macroeconomic and financial factors on the evolution of wine prices. Thereby, we have empirically identified the macroeconomic determinants of fine-wine prices. Throughout the past 20 years, the price of fine wines have been moving in accordance with the economic cycles, and there was a significant breakpoint at 2004 when fine wines started to be increasingly financialized. Finally, we have witnessed the existence of long-term relationships between fine-wine price indices and stock-market indices, and confirmed the transmission of price fluctuation from financial markets to fine-wine markets in a short-medium term."
"The two last centuries have witnessed an exceptional revolution in the organization of electric power markets worldwide. The industry's organization has changed from vertically integrated monopolies under regulation to unbundled structures that favor market mechanisms; known as reform process in Europe. The shift to reliance on market prices, given concentrated structures and particular characteristics of electricity industry, raises a possibility that some firms could influence the market prices by exercising their market power. The issues of ""market power"" in a given industry have been abundantly employed in the literatureof Industrial Organization since the late 1970s but theoretical and empirical studies of ""market power in electricity markets"" have only been developed recently. In this thesis, we attempt to carry out an insight research around market power questions in deregulated wholesale electricity markets in Europe, as regarding the way of defining and measuring it. We carry out empirical studies in two of the biggest liberalized electricity markets in Europe: France (2009-2012's data) and Germany (2011's data), using econometric regressions and electricity simulation models as main methodologies. The subject is particularly relevant inthe context of energy transition in Europe (transition energetique in France and Energiewende in Germany)."
"The EU has adopted many reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the past decades. Price support has decreased, and decoupled payments have been introduced. As a result, European agricultural prices have become more volatile, in line with world prices.This dissertation measures the evolution of the productivity of French agriculture in a dynamic stochastic farm decision model in the new economic context with increased price volatility. On this basis, it studies the dynamic link between price risk, farmer decisions, and productivity in the structural estimation framework. The literature review in Chapter 2 describes productivity as a residual and emphasizes the measurement issues from the unobserved capital data series and the endogeneity problem in primal estimation.Chapter 3 compares the numerical methods to solve and estimate nonlinear dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) or DSGE-like models, in which capital and productivity are latent state variables. Chapter 4 estimates productivity in a dynamic stochastic decision model based on the generalized maximum entropy (GME) approach. We show that the productivity growth in French agriculture has slowed down and become more volatile following the rise in price volatility. Overall, price risk has an impact on productivity in the way that when exposed to high risks, farmers change their production, consumption, investment and financial borrowing decisions, which in turn affects the realized productivity negatively. Chapter 5 simulates the market impacts of the CAP instruments in a dynamic GTAP-AGR CGE mode"

"The thesis studies the relationships between the Optimal Unemployment Insurance (UI) literature recommendations and post unemployment job stability. We focus on one particular job quality dimension that is job stability within a context of a huge increase of very short duration job contracts in France since the 2000’s. Using job search and matching frameworks, we analyse how the features of the UI system affect job stability. The particularity of our approach is that we account for employees’ behaviors while the majority of the literature on optimal UI focuses only on jobless workers behaviors. We show notably that job-seekers who leave quickly unemployment tend to find unstable jobs. Once employed they have a greater probability to return to unemployment because the job-retention efforts they exert are not sufficient."
"En anglais : This thesis proposes an analysis of food price stabilisation policies in poor countries. In order to represent the conditions in these countries, we introduce in a rational expectations storage model the assumption that consumers cannot insure against price risk and are risk averse. The market incompleteness justifies public intervention and various stabilisation policies are analysed. An optimal storage policy implies a storage level higher than without intervention. This additional storage crowds out private storers by removing the profit opportunity from speculation. Since the use of complex intervention rules is unlikely in poor countries, we compare state-contingent optimal food storage policies, with and without commitment, to simple storage rules such as a constant private storage subsidy or a price-band defended by public storage. The ability of government to commit to a policy rule brings additional welfare gains in comparison with a discretionary policy. These gains stem from the possibility of manipulating producers' expectations and, thus, of inducing them to promote stabilisation. Simple stabilisation rules can achieve, when designed optimally, gains closed to those of state-contingent policies. Finally, the analysis of stabilisation policies is extended to an open economy framework in which the stabilisation instruments are trade and storage policies. An optimal storage policy alone fails to protect consumers, since most additional storage is actually used to serve the world market. In contrast, an optimal trade policy strongly decreases price volatility by exploiting the world market. "

"This thesis focuses on some critical issues of the access to international financial markets in developing and emerging market economies. The first part provides a general overview of the macroeconomic consequences of one of the most market-friendly monetary policy regime—inflation targeting—using a meta-regression analysis framework. The second part analyses government bond market risk and stability. The last part investigates the disciplining effects of government bond market participation—bond vigilantes. In Chapter 1, the results indicate that the literature of the macroeconomic effects of inflation targeting adoption is subject to publication bias. After purging the publication bias, the true effect of inflation targeting appears to be statistically and economically meaningful both on the level of inflation and the volatility of economic growth, but not statistically significant on inflation volatility or real GDP growth. Third, differences in the impact of inflation targeting found in primary studies can be explained by differences in studies characteristics including the sample characteristics, the empirical identification strategies, the choice of the control variables, inflation targeting implementation parameters, as well as the study period and some parameters related to the publication process. Chapter 2 shows that the adoption of inflation targeting regime reduces sovereign debt risk in emerging countries. However, this relative advantage of inflation targeting—compared to money or exchange rate targeting—varies systematically depending on the business cycle, the fiscal policy stance, the level of development, and the duration of countries’ experience with inflation targeting. Chapter 3 shows that remittances inflows significantly reduce bond spreads, whereas development aid does not. It also highlights that the effect of remittances on spreads arises in a regimes of lower developed financial system, higher degree of trade openness, lower fiscal space, and exclusively in non-remittances dependent regimes. Chapter 4 indicates that countries with credit default swaps contracts on their debts have a higher probability of experiencing a debt crisis, compared to countries without credit default swaps contracts. It also finds that the impact of credit default swaps initiation is sensitive to several structural characteristics including the level of economic development, the country creditworthiness at the timing of credit default swaps introduction, the public sector transparency, the central bank independence; and to the duration of countries’ experiences with credit default swaps transactions. Chapter 5 shows that bond markets participation encourages government in developing countries to increase their domestic tax revenue mobilization. Finally, it finds that bond markets participation improves the mobilization of internal taxes, compared to tax on international trade, and reduces their instability. Chapter 6 shows that the presence of domestic bond markets significantly reduces financial dollarization in domestic bond markets countries. This effect is larger for inflation targeting countries compared to non-inflation targeting countries, is apparent exclusively in a non-pegged exchange rate regime, and is larger when there is a fiscal rule that constrains the conduct of fiscal policy. Finally, it finds that the induced drop in inflation rate and its variability, nominal exchange rate variability, and seigniorage revenue are potential transmission mechanisms through which the presence of domestic bond markets reduces financial dollarization in domestic bond markets countries."
"This thesis is devoted to the study of decision making within couples and the analysis of gendered educational choices. Until now, economic models provide a better understanding of behaviors, but do not achieve to explain gender differences in a whole. Indeed, traditional economic variables do not allow to represent entirely the allocation of time between partners, and human capital models do not achieve to explain why girls choose less paid tracks. The first chapter of this dissertation aims at better understanding determinants of “who gets what” within couples, in terms of monetary resources and time. Then a second chapter focuses on the production sphere of the household, by confronting the efficiency assumption to the allocation of time within couples. It is shown that the efficiency assumption seems to be challenged in the household production process. But how can we then represent behaviors ? It may be judicious to try to represent a second best optimum, integrating some constraints or social representations, and particularly gender stereotypes or different beliefs in the society on the abilities of men and women. The third chapter than investigates the impact of different beliefs about the abilities of boys and girls in sciences and humanities on educational choices. Then a last chapter analyses the influence of gender stereotypes upon abilities of men and women to produce domestic goods."
"Cultural firms have developed at all times management practices that are apart from standard management (Chiapello, Benghozi). Our research focuses on managerial innovation in the management tools of these unique firms. In a context of disruption (LOLF 2006), an extreme management situation (Lievre), some cultural organizations have been able to cope by innovating: what management tools did they invent and how did they develop them? Our theoretical framework articulates four approaches: the socio-material assemblages that are constructed during the morphogenesis of management tools (Orlikowski); the structural dimensions of these tools (Hatchuel, Weil); their trajectories of appropriation (Grimand); the creativity in play (Amabile) in the emergence of managerial innovation. Our epistemological posture is constructivist. We observe these managerial innovations through the cases of four performing arts firms that we followed and accompanied for three years in an involved expert position. Relying on a comparative analysis of the four cases, we thus highlight: the efficiency of the concept of bisociation (Koestler) to account for key moments in the morphogenesis of managerial innovations; the role of the managers’ value system in the trajectory of constitution of the tools; the effect of the creative characteristics of cultural managers in the development of their indigenous management."
"This research is centered on an empirical approach of the effects of privatization of public enterprises in Gabon, that is to say, contemporary changes effected from the means of production. This was to test the hypothesis that the economic influence of international companies supports new forms of cultural and symbolic influence that rely on new devices: the managerial system. This poses a dual approach to this research: first, of macrosociological order, based on the analysis of the economic influence of international companies, that is to say, grabbing corporate capital privatized by international firms and second, the microsociological, which emphasizes the managerial influence of international companies on the countervailing powers"
"This thesis is concerned with transformations and the different means for implementing territorial engineering. Its aim is to analyse territorial engineering through the emergence of a new instrument, the territorial observatory. It advances the hypothesis that the skills of territorial development professionals play a key role in the effectiveness of this engineering, whereas the way it is structured highly influences the evolution of these skills. We focus on the design and uses of observatories in the Pyrenees Mountains through interviews with the actors who participate in these projects, as well as from the viewpoint of a participating observer within a territorial expertise structure. Observatory projects illustrate the challenge involved in the construction of collective skills for territorial engineering, essential for integrating expertise into the territorial framework. This challenge exists at different levels : between representatives of the same structure and between representatives of different structures. These levels give rise to mediators who encourage the emergence and the consolidation of collective skills. These processes lead to transformations in the individual skills of professionals as well as a crossover between them, thus resulting in the emergence of hybrid professional profiles. In relationship to the overall skills mobilised in territorial development projects, those necessary for territorial observatory projects can be distinguished by a greater need for strategy, while requiring specialised technical skills. The geographic approach to skills as a resource for territorial construction is a major contribution of this thesis."

"This thesis addresses two aspects of the dependence between financial assets. The first part is about the dependence between random vectors. The first chapter consists in a comparison of several algorithms that compute the optimal transport map for the quadratic cost between two (possibly continuous) probabilities over R^n. These algorithms compute couplings, called maximum correlation couplings, which have a property of extreme dependence that naturally appears in the definition of multivariate risk measures. The second chapter defines a notion of extreme dependence between random vectors based on the covariogram; the extreme couplings are characterized as maximum correlation couplings, up to a linear transform of one of the multivariate margins. A numerical method to compute these couplings is provided, and applications to the stress testing of multivariate dependence for portfolio allocation and the pricing of European options on several underlyings are detailed. The last part describes the spatial dependence between two Markovian diffusions, coupled with a state dependent correlation function. An integrated Kolmogorov forward PDE is established that relates the family of spatial copulas of the diffusion and the correlation function. Then the problem of attainable spatial dependence between two Brownian motions is addressed, and we show that some classical copulas are not admissible to describe the stationary dependence between Brownian motions"
"L'objectif de cette thèse est d'apporter un éclairage sur l'efficacité des politiques publiques sur le marché du travail. Dans les deux premiers chapitres, nous proposons des évaluations empiriques de deux politiques publiques sur le marché du travail français: * le CV anonyme: le bloc état-civil est supprimé du CV (premier chapitre). L'anonymisation réduit les écarts d'accès aux entretiens entre les femmes et les hommes. Cet effet limité aux offres d'emploi pour lequelles à la fois des hommes et des femmes postulent semble se prolonger aux phases ultérieures du recrutement, jusqu'à l'embauche; * générosité de l'assurance chômage : une augmentation de 8 mois de durée maximale d'assurance chômage n'affecte pas la qualité de l'emploi trouvé, même si elle ralentit le retour à l'emploi (second chapitre). Ces évaluations s'appuient sur des données expérimentales ou quasi expérimentales permettant l'identification de causalité. A cet effet, nous comparons un groupe traité et un groupe de contrôle qui sont statistiquement identiques avant la mise en place du traitement. Ce cadre d'analyse n'est pour autant pas exempt de difficultés méthodologiques. Dans les deux derniers chapitres, nous abordons deux difficultés méthodologiques des évaluations micro économétriques des programmes d'assistance aux chômeurs: * comparabilité ex post des groupes traité et témoin en présence d'attrition différenciée entre groupes expérimentaux (troisième chapitre) ; * effets d'équilibre affectant le groupe témoin (quatrième chapitre)"
"This thesis is based on works in econometrics and the use of original data. It focuses on three themes : the economics of natural disasters, the relationship between the price of crude oil and the price of gasoline, and the effects of internships on employability, wages and satisfaction at work. "

"Our thesis aims to demonstrate that resistant individuals can be integrated as real stakeholders of the organizational learning process. This integration is possible when the consequences of their identity defense mechanisms for the organization are taken into account. To achieve this goal, our qualitative study follows a semi-grounded theory approach. This approach combines a preliminary theoretical framework and inductive empirical data to elaborate a model showing some positive contributions of resistance. Our research first addresses change through its impact on organizational identity (Corley & Gioia, 2004). Then, it considers how resisting activities can achieve significant organizational change (Courpasson et al., 2012). Finally, it develops a cognitive approach of change that brings us to consider resisting behaviors for their participation in the diversity of points of view inside the organization. Based on logbook extractions, 42 semi-directive interviews and a documentary analysis, our data provide a better understanding of how change takes root in the organization and how resistant individuals participate in this process. Thus, this inductive study results in a two-level model. The first level shows radical organizational change as a three-steps process: initiation, accentuation and rooting. In particular, we focus on organizational identity, its dissonances with alternative identity-related logics and the employees’ implication in the adjustment of change. This process results in the emergence of individual and organizational learning associated to a cognitive governance. The second level details the roles of the resistant individuals in this process. It shows that they can be real stakeholders of the key stages of change. In so doing, they allow the company to evolve towards the ideal of learning organization. We also propose a typology of resistant individuals (Forgotten, Followers, Emergent, New rebels), which allows us to develop some positive implications of resistance."
"Our research focuses on the emotional and axiological determinants of investment choice in equity crowdfunding. We defend the thesis of a projects choice determined in part by the values and emotions of the individual investor. Our literature review is transversal to several fields of social sciences. Thus, the established theoretical framework articulates finance, marketing, HRM and psychology. An explanatory model using structural equations is proposed and tested empirically using data from a laboratory experiment. Our results confirm that values and interest in the project, an affective variable, have a significant effect on investor choices and dominate analytical judgment in the absence of real and virtual social interactions.  An original theory is proposed to improve the understanding of the studied phenomenon, beyond the contributions of the signal theory. This theory, emotional matching, personalizes behaviors and offers a prism of reading based on the congruence between characteristics of the project and investor preferences. Its implementation by a model derived from the explanatory model associated with an ad hoc similarity measure produces encouraging predictive results. Our work ends with a set of managerial suggestions arising from our findings."
"Spatial mobility is put forward as a solution to the economic changes impacting rural and urban areas (their economic sectors, companies and ultimately, their workers). On the one hand, the need to resolve the problem of unemployment and to meet the labour needs of businesses are two drivers of this mobility, and on the other hand, the viscosity factors of the labor market and in particular territorial anchorage situations are regarded as anomalies. The aim of public policy management is then to solve these anomalies by implementing measures promoting mobility, essentially providing workers with the most general skills, with the idea of securing career paths through greater mobility.In this context, the integration or “anchoring” of workers in a particular area or “territory” is difficult to understand and the specification of skills linked to an area is considered a strategic mistake. However, it turns out that despite the measures in favor of an increasing mobility, many workers still prefer to stay where they are rather than leave their area, preferring the risk of suffering a period of unemployment or even accepting a job that does not match their qualifications. In addition to this, companies seem to look for specific skills such as trust or reputation, which are related to a form of territorial integration.The aim of this thesis is to shed light on this apparent contradiction, assuming that this situation of territorial integration maintains itself for positive and valid economic and social reasons. Indeed, by combining the specificity of the skills observed and the territorial aspect of the economy, we are seeking to identify skills that are specific to an area, which, in our opinion, explain the relationships between companies, their human resources and the area itself.In this thesis, we will try to establish empirically the existence of these specifically “territorial” skills, which are have been foreseen in the literature.As part of regional economics, this thesis is based on the theory of labor market segmentation and we have borrowed one of its special characteristics, namely the skill segmentation described in Becker's human capital theory (1964).Specification by human resources is not an anomaly but the outcome of a market functioning “normally”. Thus, in general, the specification of workers and by extension of their skills can be explained as a source of competitive advantage for companies according to resource-based theory (Penrose, 1959).This study is based on three levels of data : a database of 213 Territorial Employment Initiatives from the Ministry of Labor, an analysis of the area of Figeac, from a observing-participating position, and a series of interviews carried out in the areas of Langres and South Alsace.In terms of results, we implemented and tested an identification method that revealed three specific territorial competences: the competence of anticipation of the territory's market, the relational competence specific to the territory and the competence of detection and use of local skills.Each of these skills is a combination of basic individual skills which enable the development of an economic activity specific to the company and connected to the area it is in. Alongside these skills, we have also identified in these various areas the collective competence of territorial development.These skills were analyzed in the context of their territories. Thus, in terms of local public policy, this research will make it possible to better specify the territories for companies and local players. It will also provide an answer in terms of securing career paths."
"Endometriosis becomes an increasingly major health problem because of its prevalence (nearly one woman out of ten), multiple complications leading to a significant cost on the society. The cost of the disease is also the cost of its consequences which are the treatments of infertility and also the loss of productivity of women and their entourage that are not yet clearly identified. These consequences are more important when there is a delay in the diagnosis (the average delay of diagnosis is longer than 6 years), but the longer the period of diagnosis is, the more the disease will be detected in a more severe stage. The patients at this severe stage have more complications, requiring more expensive care, to which must be added the medical wandering and the inadequate treatment.The desire for a better knowledge and recognition of the disease has resulted in associative actions all around the world. The economic evaluation of health care, based on case studies, is an important tool to optimize the choices to improve the situation of the patients. This thesis is divided into five chapters : the first chapter attempts to elucidate framework of health economic evaluation and the evaluation of the social cost of illness. The second chapter focuses on the endometriosis disease in detail and the methodology used in the case studies presented in Chapter Three, Four and Five. The third chapter presents a multicenter study on the costs and quality of life of women suffering from symptoms associated with endometriosis in Europe. The fourth chapter is concerned with a prospective study on the societal cost of endometriosis in France. The fifth chapter is devoted to a retrospective study on the persistence of costs associated with endometriosis over time.This thesis shows the importance of endometriosis on the health care system in terms of cost (€ 10.6 billion per year) and illustrates the need to improve care in favor of earlier interventions and an earlier refer to competence centers. With constant efficiency, it is possible to estimate the cost reduction linked to a more productive policy. Improving the quality of diagnosis and management also maximizes the affected usefulness of women in terms of quality of life."
"Geographical Indications (GIs) designate a particular label used to ensure quality, origin and protect products from counterfeiting. They bind the quality and the reputation of a product to a territory and are very present in Europe, especially in France. At a time when consumers are demanding more transparency and informations about the origin of the goods they consume, valuing local products represents an important issue. In this thesis, we analyze consumers' willingness to pay for products under geographical indications by using the Kantar WorldPanel database, which includes data of purchases of French households. With a focus on Auvergne PDO cheeses, we work on the period 2008-2010, which represents the period of reform and restructuring of actors in the Auvergne PDO cheeses sector. In a first step, we carry out a meta-analysis in order to observe what the studies tell us about the subject. Knowing that the willingness to pay is a price premium, we estimate the dispersion and the price determinants of Auvergne PDO cheeses in a second step. Finally, in a third step, we answer to our main research question by estimating determinants of choices and the consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Globally, we find that the geographical indication plays an important role in the minds of consumers during purchasing activities, but in order to be more effective, it must be accompanied by promotion strategies initiated by distributors and producers. Similarly attributes of product and conditions of distribution play a more important role in the decisions of purchases, with regard to, the characteristics of consumers. Finally, we note that consumers have WTPs very different from a PDO cheese from Auvergne to another, but all these WTPs converge towards a single price, which represents the expected price of consumers for these products."
"In this thesis, we examine the effect of the unequal distribution of natural resources between countries on three main aspects. In chapter one, we empirically examine potential asymmetric effects of the accession of the World Trade Organization (WTO) across members, focusing specifically on the developing countries. The results suggest that membership in the WTO contributed to greater exports for all countries, except for non-emerging resource-rich countries. In contrast, emerging resource-rich countries are the greatest beneficiaries from the accession of the WTO. In chapter two, we empirically explore the impact of natural resource endowments on the gains of six Regional Trade Agreements (RTA) across members through three axes: complementarity between countries, diversification of resource-rich countries, and trade creation and diversion. We conclude that the complementarity between resource-rich and resource-poor countries has been achieved in the ECOWAS, SADC and CIS agreements. The results also indicate that in all RTAs, the resource-rich countries increased exports in non-natural resource sectors and thereby diversified their export structures, especially with regional partners. Moreover, in most RTAs, poor countries boosted their exports to resources-rich partners, while resource-rich countries suffer from trade diversion in terms of imports. In the last chapter, we study the impact of natural resource endowments on the process of convergence among PAFTA countries. First, the results demonstrate that sigma-convergence was only observable between 1970-1990 among PAFTA countries. The estimation reveals that natural resources are one of the main determinants of conditional convergence within PAFTA. Therefore, the asymmetry between countries in terms of natural resource endowment did not impede the convergence in PAFTA. Club convergence analysis identify three main clubs among PAFTA countries. In addition, the factors that determined clubs’ formation are natural resources, quality of institutions, and investment. Further, an abundance of natural resources is alone not enough to be the best club, but must be accompanied by high-quality institutions."
"Developing countries, especially countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, are confronted with the need to reduce poverty while their populations are stillincreasing at high rates. Micro small and medium-sized enterprises hold the highest potential for job creation and income generation. However, lack of financing, among numerous other obstacles, significantly impedes their development.Microfinance institutions have played, and continue to play, a significant role in meeting the growing financing needs of MSEs excluded from the formal financial sector. In this dissertation, we attempt to illustrate some points to pay particular attention to in order to increase microfinance impacts. Firstly, we highlight that initial financial constraints may prevent entrepreneurs from investing in their first-choice sector and that ultimately, this misallocation of talent could be detrimental for growth. This result emphasizes the need for start-up financing, which is one of the riskiest and most critical aspects of running a business. Secondly, we draw attention on the fact that up-scaling strategies implemented by MFIs may lead to competition with banks. The net economic impact of up scaling strategies will depend on how much MFIs neglect the poorest clients (mission drift) and to what extent clients with the highest growth potential can in fact resort to commercial banks. Finally, we shed light on the fact that the lack of financial knowledge among entrepreneurs may actually skew their financing choices and ultimately prevent them from obtaining more affordable sources of financing.As a whole, MSEs need special attention to foster their growth and contribution to job creation. MFIs are a powerful tool to help MSEs meet growth objectives, but optimal development may require other forms of financial assistance and better suited funding."
"Malaria and pneumonia remain a public health problem in low-income countries, including Madagascar. However, while malaria has received more attention and its control programs have been strengthened since the creation of the Global Fund in 2002, pneumonia is often neglected. Face on the encouraging results of malaria community case management, UNICEF wants to integrate pneumonia management at community level. To support this advocacy, the impact and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy must be known to verify that it is effective and efficient. This is the purpose of Chapter 4 of this thesis which studies the pilot experiment conducted by Unicef in the district of Antalaha. It is shown that this program has had a significant impact on the management of malaria and pneumonia. However, the quality of this care is questioned. This situation indicates that, before scaling up, this program should be revised to improve it. Besides the loss of well-being, malaria and pneumonia have a financial and economic cost. Therefore, the economic effects of the two diseases are shown in the chapters 2 and 3 concerning the case of Madagascar. Previously, the theoretical under-base of the link between health and economic development is presented in the first chapter."
"Lamb and kid meats are part of the identity of the livestock farming systems of small ruminants in Mediterranean area. But these meats are often qualified as “co-products”, that is to say issued from a main activity dedicated to another product they are linked with by interdependency. Therefore, their history is marked by a progressive disappearance due to the sectorisation of the activities and a decoupling of productions. Our research is based upon a comparative analysis between several situations where a dominant product and its co-product are under tension. The studied couples are: i) in Corsica island, cheeses and milk lambs and kids, ii) in Sardinia island, cheeses and lambs and iii) in Morocco, argan oil and arganian forest kids.From the initial situations showing complementarities between the various productions within a same productive system, we observe a progressive competition around the use of some dairy or forestry resources. The appropriation of such resources by a major product, engaged in a movement of specification (cheese, argan oil) validated by the recognition as geographical indication, marginalized the co-products (lamb and kid meats) weakening their conditions of elaboration and marketing. Thus, I analyzed the interactions between interdependent productions within a same productive system, focusing on the consequences of the recognition of a major product on the future of its co-product.The results are contributing to agrarian geography as a discipline centered on the relationships between production and territory, clarifying the way of functioning of the productive systems. The originality of this work lies on the scale of analysis gathering several products linked together within a productive system. One main stake has been to question the meaning of “quality” as driving social and technical boundaries that become, as general requirements, potential sources of exclusions according to the future of the co-products. The fact to recognize a major product, considered as participating to strengthen the territory, may induce the destruction of the links unifying the elements of the productive system and, by the way, weaken the territory. Such results open perspectives on the production of multi-situated territories, overcoming the classical way to consider this production under institutional logics (ie geographical indication isolating one product from its whole system) for designing plural and interlinked functionalities. Through the study of co-products involved into processes of recovery, I achieved understanding the frictions created around the uses of shared resources, rivalries and conflicts, but also possible resulting compromises that may contribute to processes of recoupling with perspectives of multi-functionality."
"Adaptation to global change challenges at the river basin scale requires selecting from demand and supply management measures in a context of high uncertainty on future conditions. Given the interdependency of water users, agreements need to be found at the local level to implement the most effective adaptation measures. Therefore, this thesis develops an approach combining economics and water resources engineering to: select a cost-effective programme of adaptation measures in the context of climate change uncertainty; and define an equitable allocation of the cost of the adaptation plan between the stakeholders involved. The framework developed integrates inputs from the two main approaches commonly used to plan for adaptation. The first, referred to as “top-down”, estimates the impact on the local water resources from different climate change scenarios at the global level. Conversely, the second, called “bottom-up”, starts by assessing vulnerability at the local level to then identify adaptation measures to face an uncertain future. Outcomes from the previous approaches applied in the Orb River basin (France) are integrated to select a cost-effective combination of adaptation measures through a least-cost optimization model developed at the river basin scale. Supply-side infrastructure development measures are considered, as well as demand-side household water conservation measures or irrigation efficiency improvement. The model is then used to investigate the trade-offs between different planning objectives and to identify robust and least-regret adaptation measures. The issue of allocating the cost of the adaptation plan is considered from two complementary perspectives. The outcome of a negotiation process between the stakeholders is modelled through the implementation of cooperative game theory to define cost allocation scenarios. These results are then compared with cost allocation rules based on social justice principles to provide contrasted insights into a negotiation process. The interdisciplinary framework developed during this thesis combines economics and water resources engineering methods, creating a promising means of bridging the gap between bottom-up and top-down approaches and supporting the definition of cost-effective and equitable adaptation plans at the local level."

"The fast growth of the world trade during the last two decades was characterized by an improved performance as well as an economic instability of emerging countries. According to the literature, the technological specialization is often associated with growth, competitiveness and economic stability. Recognizing this, we analyze the impact of the specialization of emerging countries on their growth and on their economic stability and we estimate the impact of the competitiveness (itself related to specialization) of these countries on their export performance.In a first chapter, we outline the contours of the notion of specialization according to the various theories.Having determined as objectively as possible a list of emerging countries referring to the most criteria used in the literature and having measured the degree of specialization of these countries, we study the map of the technological specialization in emerging countries over the 1995-2014 period. According to this cartography, we notice a bad orientation of their specialization. These countries are essentially characterized by a strong specialization in Labour-intensive and resource-intensive manufactures and low-tech items that are low value-added specialization. The specializing in high technology is largely driven by imports. Exports are mainly drawn by assembly activities.In the second chapter, we first assess the impact of technological specializations of emerging countries on their economic growth and we compare the results with those found in the developed and developing countries. We find that different types of specialization have a positive impact on the growth of emerging countries. But this positive impact cannot hide the misdirection of this specialization (result of Chapter 1).Second, we study the impact of competitiveness (price- and non-price competitiveness) of emerging countries on the development of their exports. We note that the impact of price-competitiveness on the evolution of the exports of the countries in our sample depends on the indicator used. It is negative when we use the exchange rate and positive when we use productivity.We also find that the impact of the structural competitiveness, measured by the expenses in the high technology and by the specialization in the high technology, is positive. It can be explained by the more and more increasing world demand in the high-technology products.In the last chapter, we focus on the relationship between specialization and economic stability and we compare this relationship with that observed in developed countries. We find that countries whose specialization is based on natural resources are more unstable and that the impact of specialization in high technology depends on the country's level of development. The impact is negative for developed countries and positive for emerging countries. This difference in the impact may be due to the assembling policy used by most emerging countries and which leads to import of high-tech products (HT) as parts and components."
"This thesis focuses on impact evaluation of employment policies on the informal economy in Algeria. In the first chapter, we look to definitions and quantitative measures of the informal economy. We try to establish a standardized framework of analysis to reduce methodological conflicts. In the second and third chapters, we estimate the weight of the informal sector and informal employment in the labor market. We also describe those who are working in the informal economy. In the fourth chapter, we study their motivations and the reasons for this type of jobs. We look whether they are involved in a process of social exclusion or make a deliberate choice. We also discuss the heterogeneity of these jobs. In the two last chapters we examine if the employment policies in Algeria have contributed to reduce informality and employment. In the light of our results but also based on other experiences, we test economic policy measures. To do this we use data bases from household employment surveys conducted by the National Office of Statistics (ONS) from 1997 to 2013."
"MENA countries is today, at the center of ambitious economic stakes mainly in regional integration and structural transformation. However, the Arab States of this region have suffered great shortcomings and vulnerability in the economic and productive system in the aftermath of massive political, economic, social and popular upheavals and upheavals. These shocks present a number of new challenges. The main objective of this thesis is to study the new dynamics of the structural transformation process in order to propose new development trajectories for these countries. In this context, we address issues related to the spatial determinants and effects of this process, the relationship between economic complexity and air pollution on the one hand, and economic complexity and inequalities on the other education. For this, we consider a dynamic panel of 133 countries covering an important and recent period (1984 to 2014). Using recent data and integrating previously little used parameters, we highlight particular characteristics of the process of complexification of productive systems. From a general point of view, the results reveal that the productivity performance of productive systems is very heterogeneous within MENA countries and that their determinants depend on the characteristics of the economies. The large disparities observed are explained, beyond the significant effect of per capita income, by a deficiency in the institutional system, particularly in terms of access to innovation, but also to the abundance of natural resources or the attractiveness of foreign direct investment. Beyond the individual characteristics of economies, spatial analysis shows that geographical factors such as urbanization rate, trade agreements, but especially spatial location play a very important role in the process of structural transformation.We also bring, thanks to the tools derived from classical mechanics, answers to the limits of traditional economic models which are difficult to demonstrate the existence of a process of accelerating economic development."
"In the practice of urban planning, travel demand forecasts are generally obtained by using the four-step model (generation, distribution, modal split and assignment), despite considerable theoretical advances in the field. This persistence can be explained by the relative ease of implementation of the four-step modelling sequence, which is related, in particular, to the kind of data available that could be used as an input in a model. However, the static nature of the approach raises questions as it pertains to its relevance in producing medium and long range forecasts. This thesis investigates the validity of the hypothesis of temporal stability of the parameters of the first three stages of the traditional forecasting sequence. To do this, taking the Lyon conurbation as our case study, we coded the road and transit networks at different points in time (1985, 1995 and 2006). We then combine this temporal data, which is generally unavailable, with the corresponding household travel surveys in order to calibrate the first three steps of the traditional model and test their predictive ability. For the generation models tested, we note acceptable performance for a 10-year forecast. For a 20-year forecast, some changes in lifestyles have resulted in a decrease in the average number of work trips that traditional models do not predict accurately. Regarding trip distribution, the increase in travel distances observed for certain purposes is reproduced fairly well by the gravity model. At the modal split level, the parameters are not stable and the estimated models would be unable to predict accurately the recent increase in the market share of public transport."
"Smallholding agriculture lies at the crossroads of mitigation and adaptation strategies. Both mitigation efforts to limit the atmospheric accumulation of greehouse gases and adaptation measures that aim to at least maintain agricultural yields and incomes in the face of climate change will be instrumental in eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. This dissertation explores the adoption of climate-smart technologies by Costa Rican smallholders in the two main farming systems of the country, namely high-quality coffee plantations and extensive cattle-ranching farms. I present the resultsof three studies that use primary data to investigate opportunities and challenges for scaling-up agroforestry and silvopastoralism. Potential barriers that put strain on technology adoption by rural households in the developing world are outlined in the introduction. In the first Chapter, a representative coffee farm model of land allocation between production technologies is used to explore the tradeoff between adopting coffee agroforestry - a well-documented option for both mitigation and adaptation - and dealing with market risks. Based on a Choice Experiment conducted with 207 farmers, Chapter 2 assesses the willingness of coffee farmers to adopt various agroforestry-based strategies, under various types of support. Chapter 3 evaluates the effectiveness of a national cost-share program promoting the adoption of technological packages consistent with silvopastoralism-based intensification among cattle ranchers. It provides estimates of the impact of participating into the program on both the technology adoption and the land use patterns. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that the adoption of agroforestry and silvopastoralism is costly and can be slowed down due to market frictions. Public interventions can in turn be effective in encouraging smallholders to adopt these technologies through economic incentives. The choice of the technology to be promoted is found to be crucial for the cost-efficiency of such interventions, stressing the relevance of the research conducted."
"An efficient and effective transport for passengers and goods is an essentialelement for cities' daily life and development. As passengers need to resort to efficienttransport solutions, allowing to reach their destinations at scheduled time, similarly,goods must be handled quickly to avoid creating excessive stocks and to minimizewarehouses size and related operating costs. As urban space is a limited resource, it iscommonly argued that passengers and goods flows inter-act each other strongly.Considering the fact that both flows are growing and growing in urban environment(European Commission, 2007) the global level of urban accessibility decreases.According to this trend, congestion problems occur and as a result the travel timeincreases for all.Cities need new scenarios to reverse this trend. Facing this challenge, ourresearch aims at defining a model which will constitute a first framework to plan and tocontrol both passengers and goods flows in the urban environment. It focuses on thesharing concept, which means to make a joint use of transport resources, betweenpassengers and goods flows. Driving under the national research project ANR CGOODS(City Goods Operation Optimization using Decision support System) this study assessesthe interest of implementing an shared urban transport system. The proposed transportsystem ensures the supply of goods in a medium-sized town, from an urban distributioncenter, based on a transit line that carries passengers. Vehicles running on the line usetheir residual capacity to transport goods. The goods are unloaded by the stops of the line.An capillary distribution system associated with each stop ensures goods deliveries tofinal destinations. We aim to define the economic, environmental and societal impacts ofthis system, the purpose being to provide a methodological framework to guide itsimplementation."
"This dissertation endeavors to offer a way to bridge the gap between the analysis of real and monetary phenomena in international economics. To this end, I analyze Cantillon effects, i.e. the differential impact of monetary expansion on prices, production, wealth, and the pattern of international trade. In Part I review the standard literature in international economics from the 19th century to contemporary theories. In Part II I use the contributions of Ludwig von Mises to the theory of money and business cycles as the foundation for the analysis of monetary expansion and international trade. In Chapter 4, I focus on the relationship between financial development and international trade. In Chapter 5, I analyze the impact of inflation and5fractional reserve banking on trade finance, and the transmission of business cycles across national borders. The main findings of my research are that monetary expansion modifies the direction, composition, volume and value of trade and capital flows. I apply this framework in Chapter 6, to explain the evolution of merchandise and capital flows over the last decades, and illustrate my findings with statistical evidence from the most recent financial crisis and the global trade collapse of 2008-2009. In Part III I analyze the impact of monetary expansion on international industrial organization, and the global distribution of income and wealth. In the concluding section, I draw out the major implications of my analysis for international trade and monetary policies, and its importance for future research."
"The purpose of this dissertation is to explain the success and failure factors for the foreign subsidiary of an international retailer. However, the existing literature draws on a wide range of divergent theoretical perspectives. In order to build one coherent conceptual framework, our study is based on an integrated model combining the SCP and RBV perspectives and the dynamical capability theory, while indicating the central role of core competences. Since this model was derived from industrial fields, we adapted it into a retailing model in order to understand how the core competences of the international retailer’s foreign subsidiary could influence its strategic choices and performances. This framework was used in a Grounded Theory study aimed at 21 top managers of international retailers in China. Our findings showed that the foreign subsidiary’s core competences for the international retailer could be classified as: component competences and architectural competences. Results from the international retailing fields broadly support the theoretical model borrowed from industrial fields. However, the environmental factors play a more important role in the first field."
"The goal of this doctoral research is to analyze the successive transformations of perceived image of what is an accountant in advertising aimed at them. Based on the study of advertisements published in the Revue française de comptabilité from 1955, creation date of journal by the French Order of Chartered Accountants, to 2017, the transformations of the constituent elements of the central core and the peripheral elements of accounting professionals social representations, have been analysed in accordance with Abric's theory (1984). To do this, a semiological study of advertisements was favored, based on the joint analysis of their denoted and connoted message. The results of this research show that in sixty years, the ideal of the accounting professional has gone from the machine domination to an expert in social relations, looking for pleasure at work and his or her life. It thus appears that successive technological changes in the accounting profession have contributed to the modernization of the image of what an accountant should be. The managerial interest of this research is to enable the accounting profession to better understand its perceived image in order to better control it. In doing this, this study also questions the effects of advertising the professional accountants their professional identity definition."

"This thesis focuses on French Cooperative and Participative firms (SCOP). Through the observation of this model, it offers an extensive analysis of inequality at work within firms, concentrating on wage inequality and sharing of adjustment costs.The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter compares wage distribution in SCOPs and conventional firms (CFs) by estimating wage equations based on the DADS dataset. The second chapter offers a detailed analysis of 53 workers’ interviews, conducted in 38 SCOPs in the Rhône-Alpes region. The principles of justice at work in the determination of the wage structures described in chapter one are identified. The third chapter is an econometric comparison of adjustments to demand shocks in SCOPs and CFs, involving employment flexibility as well as hour and wage flexibility. The fourth chapter explores the diversity among SCOPs, especially in access to membership and its consequences on employment adjustments.The contribution of this thesis to the debate in economics can be summarised with three points. Firstly it is the first large comparative quantitative analysis of SCOPs and CFs regarding employment and its characteristics. Secondly, the qualitative survey we use, produced with colleagues from Grenoble University, is also unique in terms of size and content. Its exploitation makes the analysis of workers’ rhetoric on equality possible. Finally, our method is original: we adopt approaches that are usually opposed and use them in unison to enrich the understanding of our subject."
"In light of the current debate about pension accounting, the dissertation examines the strengths and weaknesses of pension accounting as stipulated by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). To substantiate our arguments, we study the influence of key parameters, namely profitability, cash flow, leverage, funding status, and plan asset investment allocation, among others, on the choice of the discount rate and the expected rate of return used when accounting for defined benefit pension schemes. Prior literature, including research performed by Amir and Benartzi (1998), Asthana (1999), Picconi (2006), and Adams, Frank and Perry (2011), identifies these factors as influential in the choice of these rates. At a micro level, the impact of these rates can be tremendous on the financial status of reporting entities (e.g. inflated/deflated indebtedness or earnings) and at a macro level, the correct provisioning of pension represents a major challenge for sectors, industries or nations as a whole (OECD, 2011). In such a context, the dissertation reviews in details current regulation, research, and practices across Europe, a region which has historically attracted relatively little empirical research on a pan-European basis mainly because of the great diversity in accounting practices and local jurisdictions. A study focused on members of Stoxx Europe Total Market Index is performed to address the following research question: what are the factors impacting and explaining the choice of the discount rate and the expected rate of return ?"
"Rating agencies could not anticipate the collapse of several companies. Researches have focused on ratings impacts on stock prices and yield spreads. They investigated, more on the use of ratings by investors and banking regulators. This thesis is an extension of this work. Nevertheless, it investigates, particularly, the impacts of rating overvaluation on issuers. The main expected theoretical contribution of this work is to analyze ratings accuracy, and rating contribution to the value creation for the issuing company. We will study whether the rating of a company can be considered as a factor behind its excessive reliance on debt market, and we will analyze the impact on its financial situation."
"The purpose of this research is to improve understanding of building loyalty based on its object: the brand and loyalty program, by studying their antecedents and their effects on attitude. Research on the effectiveness of loyalty programs suggest the question if these programs improve loyalty to the brand or loyalty to the loyalty program (Bolton et al., 2000; Meyer-Waarden, 2007 and 2012 and Bijmolt et al. 2010). The study of the relative influence of the two types of loyalty to the attitude is done from the preference, intention and resistance. The methodology starts with a case study in the exploratory phase (interviews with experts), then continues with a qualitative study of members of these programs. The interaction between literature and the exploratory study has enriched the conceptual model with explanatory variables. Finally, it is based on a quantitative study with a sample of members to loyalty banking program (153 in the exploratory phase and 284 in confirmatory phase) via an access panel. The validation of the structural equation model (SEM) highlights the important role of brand loyalty in maintaining customer relations. The impact of brand loyalty on word-of-mouth is higher than that of the loyalty to loyalty program. Moreover, it has positive effects on the customer share-of-wallet as the loyalty intention, in contrast to loyalty to the loyalty program that has no effect on these two variables."
"This thesis investigates the relationship between interorganisational behaviour and innovation in sport clusters. Two central research questions are addressed. The first research question asks what constitutes a sport cluster. The second research question investigates the influence of interorganisational citizenship behaviour on product innovation in sport clusters.This thesis employs a multiple case study research design, investigating four cases in two sport sectors and three countries. The data collection consists of formal semi-structured interviews (103), explorative informal interviews (14), non-participatory observations (17), and secondary data (i.e. organisational information and archival data). The data collection and analysis is a combination of deduction and induction, hence an abductive approach. The research questions are informed by literature. However, data analysis includes inductive tactics. Data analysis processing consists of interview transcribing and report writing. Data was analysed with data coding in NVivo 10, frequency counts, report writing, within-case analysis, and cross-case analysis. Results reveal that sport clusters depend heavily on location-specific factors. Most important for sport cluster development and sustainability are geo-economic, socio-economic, and sport-related factors. Less important are political, geographical, and historical location-specific factors. These clusters comprise typical cluster organisations as members which include core equipment manufacturers, system suppliers, accessory suppliers, services providers, media, designers, professional and amateur sport, education/research institutions, and governing bodies. These cluster organisations are connected via formal and informal relationships and networks. The most common interorganisational behaviours within those linkages are advancement, altruism, loyalty, and collaboration. These behaviours enhance innovation in clusters. External links between cluster organisations are facilitated through interorganisational citizenship. These links foster innovation throughout the entire innovation process, particularly material innovation but also design and use innovation. This thesis suggests further research of sport clusters as well as the study of interorganisational citizenship behaviour and its outcomes."
"Nuclear energy always caused the polemic. Whereas some consider that a “sure” nuclear energy could contribute to ensure at the same time a better safety of the energy supplies and a reduction of the greenhouses gas emissions, others reproach its several types of risks, particularly, the nuclear accidents, the nuclear waste control, the non-proliferation and the terrorist attacks or even armed against civil nuclear installations. Actually, return of the experience of the most catastrophic nuclear accidents in history (Three Mile Island (the United States) in 1979, Tchernobyl (former USSR) in 1986 and FukushimaDaiichi (Japan) in 2011), showed that serious nuclear accidents can have a variety of potentially far-reaching effects (very often transboundary) for people, property and the environment. The Fukushima accident confirmed once again the need to improve the existing rules of international nuclear energy law to put in place a global nuclear liability regime that addresses all of the states that may be affected by a nuclear accident. Today’s challenge is, therefore, to guarantee an efficient, fair and harmonized repair of the different types of damage resulting from an accident occurring in a nuclear installation."
"Although the freight transport plays vital role in the economic sector and the freight transport demand is increasing, there are still challenges for the carriers in the freight market to keep and improve their revenue. To respond to the challenges, Revenue Management (RM) and Physical Internet (PI) are adopted as the solution in this thesis. RM is a method, which is originated from airline industry, to maximize the revenue. PI is a fully interconnected, open, dynamic logistics system aiming to develop an open global interconnected logistics networks to increase the logistics efficiency and sustainability. This thesis investigates the application of RM in PI to improve the revenue of less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers. The application of RM in PI is studied based on four research questions in RM, i.e. pricing, capacity control, forecasting, and bundle pricing. In addition, for each research question, an experimental study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed optimization models corresponded to each question. The results provide the carriers managerial implications and constructive guidance to make decisions to optimize their revenue at several levels, considering different situations and scenarios. Overall, this research investigates the Revenue Management from the point of view of LTL carriers operating in a highly dynamic environment like Physical Internet. The work in this research gives a general and systematical sight to the application of RM in a dynamic network of road freight transport. The achievements of this thesis give a basis for the future in-depth study on the revenue problem in a dynamic environment."

"Since 2008, regulatory arbitrage has attracted a lot of attention. Circumventions of banking prudential rules (such as Basel rules) using shadow banking (such as securitization or derivatives instruments) have been pointed out as one of the main causes of the banking crisis. According to the financial literature, regulatory arbitrage would be the results of “loopholes” that emerge within regulations and which are used by arbitragers to minimise their regulatory cost. However, regulatory arbitrage has not truly been analysed from a theoretical and economic perspective which is key to understand fully its causes and consequences. The first part of this dissertation will focus more specifically on the causes of regulatory arbitrage. While light is usually shed on the action of arbitragers who attempt to manipulate the legal structure of their transactions to capture profit opportunities, we emphasize the role of the regulator who purposely or not, generates the necessary conditions for regulatory arbitrage to take place. The role of rules production type and institutions are usually omitted. This point leads us to discuss in detail the difference in nature between regulation and contractual rules and their incidence on regulatory arbitrage. The second part will focus on the consequences of regulatory arbitrage. These have not only been discussed partially in the existing literature. Efficiency of regulation, quality of rules, redistributive effect, creation or destruction of resources, increased regulatory competition or harmonization strategies among jurisdictions will be discussed in this dissertation as potential outcome of this phenomenon."
"This PhD Thesis discusses the actual and potential impacts of Radical Right Parties (RRPs) on the economy and assesses these impacts – quantitatively and qualitatively – by considering the economic policy and performances of 27 European countries.We start discussing the different definitions of RRPs (Chapter 1) and their position on economic issues (Chapter 2 We derive an original taxonomy of RRPs’ positions on economic matters confirming the heterogeneity between RRPs. In Chapter 3, we critically review the literature on the political determinants of the economy and identify three conceptualisations of the ‘political’ in neo-classical economics: opportunistic, partisan, and institutional models. Chapter 4 tests our main hypotheses by using a dynamic panel data model. Results show no significant and robust evidence in support of an impact on authoritarian (e.g. security) and populist (e.g. deficits) indicators. We find evidence in support of a nativist impact, different in Eastern and Western European countries. In Eastern Europe, RRPs’ electoral scores, as well as their inclusion in a ruling coalition, are a significant predictor of increased imports and decreased exports. In Western Europe, RRPs’ strength and presence in a ruling coalition are a significant predictor of increasing gap in unemployment rates between native and foreign workforce.In order to understand the mechanisms behind our results, Chapter 5 proposes an original contribution to Amable and Palombarini (2005)’s neo-realist approach. We argue that economic policy is the result of the political regulation of social conflict and illustrate our framework with the case study of the Italian Lega Nord."
"The purpose of this thesis is to examine the sustainable management of non-renewable resources in general and phosphate rock in particular. The first chapter presents the current situation, future trends and geopolitical issues pertaining to the global phosphate market. The analysis shows a large deficit in world phosphate supply in the future, inciting producers with sufficient phosphate reserves to invest in new capacities. The second chapter develops a multi-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg model, calibrated using real data from the phosphate market. This model derives the optimal future capacities for different producers according to their reserve levels and their development costs. The results show that the market would become more concentrated in 2100, with Morocco being the dominante country wich already holding three quarters of the world's reserves. The third chapter presents and calculates the linkage effects generated by Morocco’s phosphates exploitation. Using the Input-Output model, the proposed empirical analysis compares the socio-economic impacts of extraction to those related to transformation or valorization. The results of this analysis show that phosphates transformation is more linked to the other sectors and generates higher socio-economic impacts in terms of added value, income and employement. The last chapter contributes to the literature on the natural resources curse by linking agricultural performance and urbanization to the abundance of resources. The empirical study, based on a panel of African countries, shows a significant link between the abundance of mineral resources, the underdevelopment of the agricultural sector and urban explosion."
"While the scientific literature concludes that collaborative innovation is not a new concept, definitions are often contradictory and its implementation remains enigmatic. Therefore, this thesis in management aimed to address the issue by stating its main question as follows: ""How do we capitalize on the new forms of work organization targeting collaborative innovation in regions supporting smart specialization strategies? The case of coworking spaces"". As a consequence, the following research objectives have been formulated: 1. To analyze the collaborative dimension of the organization of work in order to detect its innovative potential; 2. To identify management processes that foster collaborative innovation using the case of  coworking spaces; 3. To conjugate these processes at the level of a territory in order to propose an integrative management model capable of enhancing the potential of collaborative innovation. The thesis was articulated around three levels of analysis: conceptual, conjunctural and territorial. Empirical research has focused on several case studies: 11 coworking spaces in France and 6 coworking spaces in the United States. The triangulation of the data from semi - structured interviews, documentary analysis and empirical observation helped produce quality results. The conceptual analysis permitted to clarify the notion of ""novelty"" associated with the new forms of work organization, as well as their innovative potential; thus, this level of analysis aimed to outline the collaborative innovation analysis grid, the conceptual schema of the thesis. The conjunctural level of the analysis proposed an enriched conceptual diagram by integrating the elements of the fieldwork. Finally, the territorial analysis provided an integrative model of the territorial management of collaborative innovation. On the one hand, these results are meant to raise awareness of the new implications of collaborative work and its potential, particularly collaborative innovation; on the other hand, they emphasize the importance of space and the importance of the three types of communication - communication for coordination, communication for information, and communication for inspiration - in the management of collaborative innovation. Thus, they underline multiple opportunities to define new (public) policies for the management of (territorial) collaborative innovation."
"The aim is to explore different mechanisms (compensations, incentives) to respond to local demands for the implementation of electricity transmission infrastructures. The thesis is structured around three research axes: 1-Economic valuation of the impacts of power lines on property values 2-How to share compensation between municipalities 3-Local demand for compensatory mechanisms"
"This work is part of the search for limits of the scope of economic intelligence. By a theoretical and then practical construction, the author seeks to demonstrate the existence of internal economic intelligence.To construct the defended thesis and the research question, the author uses the method MERISE, based on the system, which allows to model the three levels of the physical, logical, conceptual) and the existing links. On the basis of the facts, it obtains by successive approaches the academic elements (trust, ethics, strategy, economic intelligence, links within the organizations) making it possible to schematize the conceptual and logical levels. After studying these elements, he draws up a new scheme and indicates the thesis defended and the research question.To answer the research question, the author convenes Greene's Laws and seeks to raise these Laws through the signatures of their jobs. This field study is carried out on a sample of convenience of ten people. This research validates the existence of internal economic intelligence. It also reveals the observed economic intelligence situation. Finally, the path taken to realize it also puts forward a reflection on the ethical positioning for economic intelligence."

": Investment and innovation play an important role in the agricultural sector, allowing farms to adapt to policy changes and market condition changes. In the last decades, farms in the European Union (EU) have faced substantial changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This is particularly the case of the dairy sector, which has seen the end of milk quota regime and increased price volatility. Such changes could affect farm productivity and efficiency, the dairy sector’s competitiveness and structural change. Understanding the mechanisms underlying farms’ investment behaviour could allow identifying key drivers that influence the observed trends. This could help anticipate future structural changes, predict farms’ needs and help policy makers and other stakeholders in farming to adapt their policy. The thesis contributes to this objective by analysing for dairy farms in a sub-region of Brittany (Ille-et-Vilaine) in France, (i) the impact of the termination of the milk quota onfarmers’ investment decisions and the heterogeneity of farm investment behaviour, (ii) the link between farm performance and farmers’ investment decisions, (iii) the role of social interactions related to neighbourhood effects on farmers' investment decision. Findings show that the termination of the dairy quota policy increased farmers’ incentive to invest, contributing to the trend towards larger, more capital intensive and more specialised dairy farms. In addition, the thesis underlines the need to take into account farmers’ heterogeneity in modelling investment behaviour. Doing so allows"
"This dissertation analyzes the development of the Chinese financial system from different perspectives. It has shed light on the recent advancements of the last decade. Overall, the findings reveal a contrasted picture of the progress achieved towards an efficient system. Chapter 1 has shown that the corporate bond market is still impeded by government influence. Based on this evidence, it is thus very unlikely to expect the banking system to decrease its dominance on the financial system. Chapter 2 also stressed that internal governance mechanisms remain imperfect. By analyzing the market price fluctuations at the time of the announcement of a CEO turnover, we find that ownership type plays a major influence on the expected consequences of such a decision. Chapter 3 revealed that little progress has been made in terms of banking competition despite the increasing number of new entrants in the market. However, banks behaved more efficiently over the decade. No trade-off seems to exist for policy-makers between the benefits of lower banking prices and efficiency of the system. Chapter 4 finally showed the beneficial effects of the capital requirement regulation on bank efficiency in China. Capital requirements, in supplement to provide higher capital buffers, appear to lower moral between banks’ shareholders and debtholders."
"In 1955, the Maspétiol commission of the French government made a negative economic balance sheet of colonization in Algeria. This balance sheet has been analyzed by historians of the economy in terms of costs / benefits for the metropolis and the colony. According to this current of colonization costs, the investments and public expenditures made in Algeria were financed by the metropolis and therefore borne by the metropolitan taxpayer. The thesis defended here is that the main cause of the negativity of the balance sheet lies in the structure of the colonial economy which did not generate enough public revenue to finance economic and social development, which required the financial support of the metropolis (plan de Constantine, 1958).The balance sheet is therefore envisaged as the result of policies pursued throughout the colonial period, more precisely the intervention of the state in economic activity since the beginning of colonization. This work, based on the literature on the economic balance sheet and more broadly on the economy of colonial Algeria as well as on unpublished archive data, shows that the so-called development policy was detrimental to the economic and social levels (1830-1900). Budget, legislative and monetary measures applied in the framework of public economic and social investments have been disadvantageous for public finances on the one hand, and for the human development of the native population on the other hand. The equipment realized (mainly in the railways) have stifled public spending in the colony without contributing to lower transport costs. Private investment in export viticulture, supported by the state, did not participate in the financing of public revenues due to absence of taxation. Regarding the policy towards the native population, it has resulted in the degradation of its heritage following land expropriation operations, as well as the fines and the taxation applied by the administration towards it. Is then asked the counterfactual question to know what would have been the Algerian economy in the absence of colonization. To answer, it is assumed that the colonial system materialized in discrimination between natives and europeans, whose legal basis was the code of indigénat. Under this hypothesis, the question is reformulated: Algeria's economic growth (gdp per capita) would have been greater if public spending on education and health had not been discriminatory between natives and europeans? The database constructed to try to give an empirical answer to this question identifies public expenditure on education and health and allocates them to the two types of population over the period 1901-1937. The data obtained clearly illustrate at the descriptive level the link between colonial politics and the balance sheet (dividing of education and health expenditure between natives and european and gdp per capita). But econometrically, the obstacles to establishing a causal relationship between spending on human capital and economic growth have prevented this search from reaching the stage of counterfactual simulation. This incompleteness is explained, on the one hand, by the state of the art theoretical on the question, on the other hand, the fact that the limitations of the available data did not allow us to go further in the construction of a causal relationship, replacing in particular the gdp per capita with a human development indicator. However, incompleteness of the counterfactual scenario does not invalidate the established results by qualitative study from literature and archival documents. This research paves the way by showing the possibility of a cliometric and counterfactual approach on this subject.This thesis calls for a future collaboration between economic economists and historians to construct the missing data."
"The purpose of this dissertation is to expose a theoretical analysis of the effects that a currency transaction tax, usually called Tobin Tax, could entail. Five essays are outlined. The first one highlights the bases and limitations of this debated proposition. In the second one, a stochastic simulation model is built in order to study the effects of such a measure on real investments and the link between tax weight and expectations. Our result is the following one : the welfare of all agents decreases whereas long term investors are the least penalized. In the third one, by using macro-monetary models and microstructure theory, we analyse the interest of such a tax in terms of exchange market efficiency. The fourth essay proposes an econometrical analysis. With a real data set, we suggest to measure for the first time the sensibility of the transactions volume to the tax. Through a cointegration analysis using panel data, an estimation of the so-called foreign transactions elasticity to taxation is presented. The obtained value is - 0.45 for any currency parity. Following this idea, we set out an estimation of the revenues that such a tax would yield in the last fifth part of the dissertation."
"This thesis aims to investigate on the validity of monetary neutrality hypothesis in CFA zone, in respect with the new neoclassical synthesis (Goodfriend and King, 2000) and his resurgence due to the extension of monetary unions. In short run, nominal rigidities may induce some real effects of monetary policy due to information asymmetries, prices viscosities or rigidities [Gordon (1980), Akerlof and Yellen (1977), Mankiw and Reis (2002)]. This confers a capability of managing negative effects of business cycles to monetary policy, with respect to the necessity of tying down agents expectations and knowing monetary transmission mechanism. In long run, monetary neutrality hypothesis steel holds, justifying the necessity to target and inflation rate around the natural rate of unemployment, as preconized by Milton Friedman (1968) and Edmund Phelps (1968). This inflation-unemployment trade-off, a fundamental relationship of macroeconomic models suppose for a full employment equilibrium that the medium or long run inflation target corresponds to the intersection of short run Phillips curve to the long run one: ""a natural rate of inflation"". The above trade-off between inflation and unemployment may seem somewhat problematic in monetary unions, due to the diversity of Phillips curves with respect to time and space. This difficulty may be overcome in an optimal currency area, as defined by Robert Mundell (1961), Ronald McKinnon (1963) and Peter Kenen (1969). Unfortunately, CFA zone has been and steel mostly a simple monetary bloc, due to the unification of exchange rate rules as pointed by Philippe Hugon (1997). For Ondo Ossa (2000), rather than standard criterion, his optimality may be found on solidarity. Chico Eboué (2000, 2002) claims the goals of monetary policy of the zone induces a bias against inflation, traducing a preference for unemployment over inflation for growth. Also, it results an exchange constraint and a reserve constraint witch induce an excessive accumulation of reserve as in currency board, exposing the zone on dangers of excessive accumulation. This conduce us to the question of this thesis: What are the appropriated monetary policy choices for the inertia and poverty of the CFA zone? The answer to this question has been taken in two ways with respect to the possibility to manage monetary aggregates for fine tuning: (i) firstly, we have investigated on the actuality of monetary neutrality in CFA zone; (ii) Secondly, the consequences of conducing monetary policy with respect of this hypothesis were our purpose. Monetary policy may face some difficulties as heterogeneous behaviours and countries characteristics, instability of money demand functions and persistence of shocks. The welfare effects of money may be limited, due to the dependence of the monetary authority's reaction functions to external factors as the ratio of reserves to short-term external debt, expected inflation differential, and the interest rate of the anchorage money. This welfare effect may be increase by determining and following an optimal trajectory of reserves as a guarantee of and additional cyclical role of monetary policy. Also, inflation expectation must be anchorage by a definition of a communication strategy."
"This thesis is based on three essays. The first chapter analyses the impact of 27 years of civil war in Angola on human capital, expenditures per adult equivalent and fertility. The prediction of the effects of civil war is done through a neoclassical unitary household model in the tradition of Rosenzweig. Using instrumental variable method, this thesis shows that civil war has a negative and disastrous impact in short-Term on health of children, this effect is persistent. Civil war has no impact on expenditures per adult equivalent. It increases enrollment and decreases fertility in the short term. The second chapter ofthis thesis analyzes the effectiveness of a social program in a conflict country such as Angola and explores whether this effectiveness depends on the intensity of the conflict. Our identification strategy is based on the political geography of the deployment of the program based on a model of spatial competition of Hotelling. This thesis shows that the Angola Social Fund had a positive impact on expenditures per adult equivalent and on one of the main anthropometric measurements namely the height for age z-Score. The program's effectiveness in function to the intensity of the conflict is analyzed using the local instrumental variable estimator. The thesis shows that the program's effectiveness increases with the intensity of the conflict. The last chapter of this thesis analyzes in the case of Cameroon, the impact of teacher training on HIV/AIDS. The two criteria for selecting participating schools, leads us to choose as identification strategy the regression discontinuity design. This thesis shows that 15 to 17 year old girls in teacher training schools are between 7 and 10 percentage points less likely to have started childbearing. For 12 to 13 year old girls, the likelihood of self-Reported abstinence and condom use is also significantly higher in treated schools."
"CEO effect on firm performance (or non-performance) is the point of many debates. According to the deterministic view, the CEO is constrained by internal and external forces and has no enough latitude for influence significantly the firm out comes. Other side, the leadership school considers that the CEO is the only one designer of the firm and is the responsible of the firm performance.These views are qualified by the managerial discretion which measures the margin flexibility theCEO has in order to make decisions to, significantly, differentiate the firm from others within a same sector. This thesis focuses on the CEO’s effect on the firm performance and the decisions that are operated in the firm. It deals with the major French CEOs who have the particularity to build powerful social networks. Chapter 1 is about the major French CEOs and draws the main features of these deciders. The phenomen on of endogamy observed during CEO succession and its impact on the firm performance are studied in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 offers an evaluation of the CEO’s impact on the firm performance and Chapter 4 measures the CEO’s power on decision about the acquisitions. This thesis confirms the idea that the economic power remains inside a closed executive cast"
"This research work is devoted to the analysis of financing decisions of French Very Small Businesses (VSB).The first chapter of this thesis describes the object of the study, namely the VSB. The second chapter revisits the main theories of capital structure in the light of the specificities of VSBs, and motivates the use of the theoretical framework proposed by the Pecking Order Theory. The third chapter tests the Pecking Order Theory on a large sample of French VSBs. The fourth chapter suggests adapting this theory to the evidence of financing choicesand financial constraints of VSBs, particularly by incorporating an infra-debt hierarchy. This chapter also provides an empirical test of the trade off between financial debts and partners' current accounts. The main contribution of this work is certainly the generalization of the Pecking Order Theory to the French VSB universe. These firms prefer internal financing to external financing, and debt to issuing shares. However, firms with excess of financing do not try to reduce debt quickly, which can be translated by the anticipation of future financing deficits, which become even more severe as these businesses are subject to credit rationing.Nevertheless, the Pecking Order Theory still does not provide any explanation for the preference of the VSBs’ managers for financial debt, compared to partners' current accounts. The fact that VSBs are generally owned and managed by the same person makes it possible to analyze their financial behavior under the diversification theory. Share holder-managers prefer diversifying their personal wealth rather than minimizing costs of information asymmetry"
"This dissertation on emerging markets is driven by one fundamental question, i.e., is there any association between accounting data and market values in high risk and volatile emerging markets. To this end, two models, residual incomevaluation (R.I.M) and abnormal earnings growth (A.E.G), have been explored in this work.In the first study, a model of type Residual Income Valuation is developed and its implications are empirically tested on sample consisting of American companies, developed countries apart from USA and emerging countries over the period2000-2007. The results show that in most of countries studied, the association between the book value and market value ofequity significantly depends on the stage of growth and the method of financing characterizing the company.The development of a valuation model of type Abnormal Earnings Growth Model ( by Ohlson & Juettner-Nauroth),including modeling of evolution of expected relationship between market value of a share, expected earnings per share in ayear, its rate of growth in short-term and a set of accounting variable composing a synthetic indicator of growth of company,is studied in the second research work of this dissertation. Our results show that (1) expected increase in earnings per shareare significantly associated with stock prices ( especially for developed countries), (2) but, as suggested by our model, the persistence of its effects is limited ( especially for emerging countries), (3) when the dynamics of growth are more complex,inclusion of a synthetic variable can make a significant correction term (4) and finally the implied cost of capital issignificantly higher for emerging countries than for developed countries"
"The initial public offering is a major financing operation in a company’s life. The choice of advising intermediaries is of paramount significance. This is the case in particular for the underwriting syndicate whose responsibilities, such as the certification of the issue price and the successful placement of securities are important. Multiple information asymmetries and anomalies in stock markets involve the issuer making the right decisions. We pay particular attention to a thorough understanding of the selection criteria used by the issuing firm in the choice of the lead manager. One of these is the reputation criteria, observed in empirical studies, mostly from across the Atlantic, which have highlighted its positive impact in mitigating stock market deviations. The approach we followed to develop this thesis led us, in the fist chapter, to justify our theoretical positioning and to develop our research framework. In the second chapter, we carried out a case study of the Electricité De France IPO, a major European issue during this last decade and undertook a qualitative approach in which we covered the economic and financial realities. Finally, the empirical verification of this issue was developed in the third chapter. We carried out a statistical study based on a sample of European IPOs in order to clarify the structure of theunderwriting syndicate and explore the relationship of this structure with the lead manager reputation."
"This thesis is composed of a set of research in applied economics that enroll in the contemporary field of economics of biodiversity. The thesis focuses specifically on the links between economic development, local welfare and biodiversity conservation in sub-Saharan Africa region. An introductory chapter presents the subject of the thesis as well as the research field and situates our contribution.The rest of the thesis is composed of two parts divided into macroeconomic studies and case studies. Part 1 (composed of chapter 2 and chapter 3) addresses the link biodiversity and development under a macroeconomic perspective by taking into account spatial interactions between countries. In chapter 2, we examine the impact of development in sub-Saharan Africa on biodiversity using recent indicators on threatened species. In chapter 3, we focus on the mechanisms that support public conservation policies in Sub-Saharan Africa and tested the effect of tourism, environmental aid and spillover effects on conservation effort. Part 2 (composed of chapter 4 and chapter 5) presents two case studies in Ivory Coast. Chapter 4 presents a cost benefit analysis using contingent valuation and market price method. It evaluates the costs and benefits of conservation for local populations. In chapter 5 we examine people's preferences for conservation and identify key factors that determine local preferences. In the last chapter we draw implications of results and present potential extensions of this thesis."
"Achieving and maintaining the credibility of monetary policy, measured by the gap between outcomes and official announcements of policy (Gilles [1992]), has become a crucial task for the Monetary Authority when, from the 1980s, was tackled in the economic literature, the issue of central banking (Bastidon & Gilles  [2014]). Indeed, the delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank vis-à-vis the public authority has become a main determinant of credibility in advanced economies (Cukierman [1992], Bordo & Orphanides [2013]). However, its relevance for developing countries due to their specific characteristics (Kugman & al [1992], Assoumou-Ella & Bastidon [2015]) is far from being settled. Using a simple model and a loss of function of the central bank similar to those of Ball [1999] or Cavoli [2008], we compare two different exchange rate regimes to determine which cases are most likely to encourage governments to intensify the fight against corruption, while maintaining the objective of price stability. A credible anchor regime leads to high taxation and low levels of corruption and inflation, but at a low level of growth. An independent monetary regime unanchored, however, usually leads to a higher level of corruption. However, when the independence of the central bank is strong enough, the independent monetary regime unanchored can also lead to less corruption, more production and spending, although with higher inflation a monetary regime with anchor. These results suggest that in the case of developing countries, the independence of the central bank associated with pegged exchange rates would be neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for price stability."
"This thesis highlights the formation of human capital in the European regions and its implications for economic growth. It is characterised by its combined regional, long-term and European approach. To this end, I refer to Unified Growth Theory and New Economic Geography as the most important recent theoretical contributions and construct an unparalleled new and large database on regional human capital and other economic factors from numerous diverse sources. For the empirical analysis, spatial and GIS methods are employed in addition to standard econometric models. In this way, the thesis explores human capital formation in the regions of the European continent between 1790 and 2010. Moreover, it underlines the relationship between human capital proxies, the determinants of human capital and the long-run impact of human capital on economic growth."
"It happens that the consumer has to deal with life issues related to identity matters. He is engaged in a process of identity construction. This research shows that the store supports the consumer in his identity project. It acts as a resource allowing him to deal with all the idenity conflicts, like body issues, distortions with the self, self esteem issues and ethnic identity issues. According to a psychological approach, this research shows that the store becomes aresource for (re)constructing the self and provides the consumer with therapeutic benefits. Through what he lives in the store, the consumer will be confronting its weaknesses and become aware of his self. The way the store helps the consumer with these conflictual identity issues makes him experiencing his self.In this research, we use a phenomenological approach that helps to highlight the consumer engagement in the process of his identity experience. Then, it offers a better understanding of the shopping experience concept."

"This research is dedicated to the analysis of dividend policy in the context of U.S. mergers and acquisitions. The first chapter of this thesis presents the framework of the study. It outlines the theoretical framework of the dividend policies and the mergers-acquisitions before stating exploratory fields related to the specificities and contributions of dividend policies in the M&A setting. Furthermore, it discusses an illustration of an US merger that embodies a real case of interactions between dividend policies during mergers-acquisitions. The second chapter empirically explores the impact of the difference between merging firms’ dividend policies on the post-merger dividend policy, and tests a probable compensation effect of the bid premium. The third chapter starts from the idea that the negative market reaction to the announcement of stock acquisitions of listed firms is derived from the acquirer’s misevaluation. Thereby, it explores the information content of the acquirer dividend policy in such deals which may reduce the information asymmetry on the acquirer valuation, and thus alleviate the negative market reaction at the announcement. The fourth chapter examines the financial characteristics of merging firms that are determining their existing dividend policies. In light of this, it assumes that the merger completion may be affected by the difference between merging firms’ dividend policies which are resulting from the difference between their characteristics. The findings of our research confirm the impact of the difference between the merging firms’ dividend policies on the conduct of the merger during and following the transaction. The main contribution of this thesis is to illustrate the importance of considering the dividend policies of companies involved in mergers-acquisitions in order to make the right decisions in favor of the reconciliation. The generalization of the clientele effect on the M&A setting allow to detect dividend clientele shocks, and reveal the need to absorb these shocks by transaction specifics and the post-merger conduct of the merged firm."
"We study the valuation, information and industry perspectives of equity carve-outs. In our first paper, we study the wealth effect of equity carve-outs and its relationship with the abnormal returns to the parent firm. Using thisrelationship we find that during book-building period of equity carve-out, the returns to the parent firm can be used to pre-empt the wealth effect of equity carve-out. In our second paper, we argue that equity carve-outs, on average, are carried out in industries, where opportunities are low. We find that these industries have low operating performance, gauged on profitability, cash flow and profit margin compared to industries where there are no carve-outs. In addition to this evidence, we find that the merger and acquisition activities, in which targetsare in industries where carve-out activities happened in last three years before the M&A activity, bidders have less value created compared to mergers where the target industry has no carve-out activity. In our third paper, we analyze the impact of carve-outs on the divergence of belief and the number of analysts following the firm. We find that divergence of belief increases after a carve-out and number of analysts following the firm increases, also."
"This study was inspired by the observation that despite the considerable efforts in financialliberalization in Malawi from the late 1980s, the apparent results were mediocre, especially with regardto the persistence of high intermediation margins (spreads). The central objective of this study is to tryto investigate why. The key hypothesis is that if one does not take into account of bank behavior interms of how banks react vis-à-vis their incentives and constraints during the process of financialliberalization, the results are likely to be disappointing. The study shows that in an economic situationcharacterized by macroeconomic instability, banks have less incentive to be more efficient from amacroeconomic perspective, i.e., by enhancing financial deepening through higher credit to the privatesector. On the contrary, while acting rationally, they are tempted to look for easy and safe returnscoming from financing government deficits. This allows them to accomplish two objectives: maximizingprofit and minimizing credit risk, notably by pushing the ""external constraints"" imposed by economicconditions - including high rediscount rates- to their customers through a combination of an increasein interest rates on loans and a smaller increase in interest rates on deposits.Keywords: financial liberalization, bank behavior, intermediation margins, bank"
"The risk management is a crucially important topic at firm and country level. This thesis investigates this subject across three empirical essays. The first essay is interested in firm’s currency risk management. The results show that the cross-border Mergers & Acquisitions offer an operational hedging to the currency risk. Moreover, this hedging creates value for acquirers’ shareholders. The decrease in currency risk exposure (in absolute value) is positively associated with acquirers’ cumulative abnormal returns (CAR). The second and the third essay concentrate on the risk management at country level - the bailout plan (the Paulson plan) during the recent financial crisis in United States. The second essay in a first step confirms the positive effect of the plan on bank participants’ CAR and on the decrease of default probability around the plan’s initial announcement. Nevertheless, the effect of the plan is not neutral among banks and big players were the winners. The last essay analyzes the Paulson plan’s spillover effect on the loan supply. Our results reveal that there is a positive and significant spillover effect of the government intervention on syndicated loans’ maturities during the post-crisis period from 2010 to 2012. However, this positive impact is not found for the size of syndicated loans. In sum, this empirical thesis from one side sheds light on the efficient ways of firm’s currency risk management, such as the operational hedging, and its positive effect for acquirers’ shareholders; from another side for the country-level government intervention, it highlights the Paulson plan’s spillover effect on syndicated loans and the heterogeneous impact among financial institutions."
"The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has witnessed many institutional and financial reforms meant to stimulate economic development. While traditional theories of economic growth promote capital accumulation and technological progress as fundamental determinants of economic development, studies that gave birth to the “new institutional economics” stress the major contribution of institutional development to economic development.  The objective of this dissertation is to understand the role of institutional quality and financial regulation in the process of financial development and economic growth in the MENA region since the 1980s. Based on recent and adequate econometric models, this dissertation answers the following questions: What is the role played by institutional quality and banking regulation in explaining capital, risk and efficiency adjustments in the banking system of the MENA region? Is there a positive and significant effect of institutional quality on banking and economic development? Can inter-country differences in terms of economic performance be explained by institutional factors? significant effect on bank capital, excessive risk taking and efficiency of banks operating in the MENA region; (ii) Banking regulation has a positive and significant effect on banking development, and there is positive and significant interdependence between economic growth and banking development; (iii) the impact of institutional quality is stronger in countries that witnessed a weak growth rate on average compared to fast-growing countries where the institutional effect is not significant."
"This thesis studies the expansion of the scope of economics to the study of phenomena traditionally considered to lie outside of the domain of economics. We claim that such a development came with the expansion of the domain of government intervention from the late 1940s on, which raised interdisciplinary questions. What was considered to be “economic”, “social” or “political” phenomena evolved and blurred. In return, this stimulated economists to overstep the traditional disciplinary boundaries. We identify three steps in the expansion of the scope of economics. First, in the context of the Cold War society, economists progressively studied political phenomena such as the problem of collective choice. Second, in the 1960s, and more precisely during Lyndon Johnson’s presidency, economists became progressively interested in the study of social problems related to the notion of poverty, such as discrimination, education, crime or public health. Finally, in the 1970s, the last step of the development of the scope of economics was characterized by the progressive fading of any a priori disciplinary boundaries. Vindicated by the success of their economic approach to political and social phenomena, some economists argued that their discipline was not defined by its field of analysis, but rather by its tools."
"Despite the dynamism of tourism sector and its weight in the international economy, this is an activity which is rarely studied by economists. The objective of this thesis is to lessen this deficiency. The first chapter is devoted to the international division of tourism production. By using a traditional international economy model and an empirical analysis, we show that tourismproduction can be internationally segmented into several steps of production, which are localized in different countries. The comparison of bilateral tourism flows is studied in the next four chapters. We begin by measuring the intra-industry trade in tourism. For this, we construct a methodology which can measure what we call ‘intra-tourism trade’ and can estimate the quality of international tourism services. We then analyze tourism specialization by level of quality, and in the following chapter, we present a theoretical and empirical survey of the intra-industry trade. Finally, we conduct an econometric study of the explaining factors for intra-tourism trade. The last chapter concerns another subject: the impact of international tourism on inequalities. For this, we conduct an econometric investigation, based on panel data modeling techniques, therefore being able to compare this impact to that of the other sectors in the economy."
"Two different topics will be discussed in this work.In the first part has been studied the possibility to obtain chiral building-blocks from pyridine. For this purpose, we intially developed an original method for quartenization of pyridium and imidazolium salts through a Mitsonubu reaction. Then, 2-aminopyridines were substituted and then engaged in a quaternization-reduction reaction, leading to satured compounds. Unfortunately, these compounds have not leaded to targeted linear building-blocks.In a second part, we have been interested in the deveopment of a new peptidomimetic family in which the amide bond is replaced by an imidazole ring, extension of previous work in our research group. Initially we focused on the development of conditions leading to considered mimic. This methodology has allowed us the synthesis of several dipetides incorporating our mimic with good results. The determination of acido-basic properties of these structures has also been investigated."
"What are the effects of labor market institutions and national culture on mergers and acquisitions activity? The thesis proceeds in answering this question along three chapters. The first chapter investigates the effects labor market institutions defined as collective bargaining on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. It provides evidence that M&A activity increases in countries with strength of labor unions and high bargaining coverage. Collective bargaining increase M&A activity because potential acquirers have greater gains opportunities sourced from reappropriation of employee ‘rents’. Second and third chapters explore effects of national culture on different M&A outcomes. They show that firms from result-oriented countries are less likely to make cross-cultural acquisitions, to complete announced deals, to become targets, and target firms experience higher CAR around announcement date. Firms from people-oriented countries are less likely to make crosscultural acquisitions, to complete deals and are more likely to become targets and target firms experience lower CAR. Firms from people oriented countries are more likely to make crossculturalacquisitions and complete announced deals."
"The Merger and Acquisition (M&A) operations constitute a key element of market economy and meanwhile form one of the main vectors of the dynamics of the industrial structures. This thesis aims at analyzing the impact of M&A operations on acquiring firm’s accounting information quality. The accounting information quality shall be interpreted first of all, as the quality of earnings. Three main axes are emerged in this problematic and constitute three main chapters of this thesis. By observing all public M&A transactions on the U.S. market from the year 1986 to 2013, these three chapters provide following main contributions. First we find the acquiring firms that involved in the mixed payment acquisition have undergone notable development, have earnings management (EM) behaviors around acquisition years. However, prior study only documented a certain kind of behaviors of the 100% stock exchange acquirers. Plus, we indicate that the EM behavior of acquiring firm is not constraint to the accruals management (AM). We show that they are also likely to use many other ways, either accounting treatment through classification shifting, or real earnings management (REM) methods, for example through the budgetary adjustment of the R&D expenditures. A close link is found between the choice of EM methods and acquisition payment method. Moreover, a substitution / complementary effect is also noted between different forms of EM methods. The impact of these EM strategies on acquiring firm’s performance is also analyzed. A moderate way of EM has positive impact on future operating performance while a high degree of these EM behaviors bring a negative impact. Nonetheless, it seems that the shareholders' wealth is only marginally affected by the choice of EM methods, in the short term as well as the long term."
"The objective of this thesis is to analyze the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows towards Africa on economic growth, industrialization, and technological transfer. Analyses aiming at studying the nexuses FDI-economic growth and FDI-industrialization are based on macroeconomic data from respectively 50 and 49 African countries observed during the period from 1980 to 2009; and analyses on FDI related technological spillovers are based on Kenyan firm-level data observed in the manufacturing sector during the period 2012/2013. Concerning the FDI-economic growth nexus, it is found that FDI inflows had a significant impact on economic growth in the African region during the period of interest. It also finds that while the low level of human resources did not limit the impact of FDI, and that the impact of FDI on economic growth was negative or non-significant during the period from 1980 to 1994 and positive during the period from 1995 to 2009. The results indicate that FDI most likely did not have a significant impact on the industrialization of African countries. Concerning the existence of FDI-related technological transfer, it is found that FDI inflows did not spur innovation in local firms competing against multinational firms."
"The cotton trade has been lucrative in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a major source of exports and government revenues and is an important cash-crop for small producers and their families. Since the 2000s, the Cameroon cotton sector has been in crisis. The combined effects of falling prices, erratic Euro/Dollar exchange rates, subsidies to producers from industrialized nations and structural factors within the sector, are to blame for the crisis. This thesis analyses the efficacy of the coordination of actors in the cotton sector within the crisis context through studies carried out in the northern Cameroon cotton region. It is based on a conceptual framework for the coordination of actors in a cotton sector and makes reference to several economic theories. The analysis shows that the Cameroon cotton sector has always been integrated from the get-go, though the privatization process is ongoing. This integration was the basis for the historic success of the sector; a success which was the result of the respect of contractual commitments between actors, while the socioeconomic context was favourable. These contracts were implicit or explicit between actors and based on trust. From an economic theoretical standpoint, such contracts are said to be ‘incomplete’, as they are not legally binding and do not cover all relevant possibilities. Hence, the respect of clauses within these contracts depends on the favourable or unfavourable outcome of socioeconomic conditions. As a result of the crisis, the efficacy of coordination within the Cameroon cotton sector is no more guaranteed and is questionable. The non-respect of several contractual commitments, attests to the severe confidence crisis between some actors. Furthermore, economic incentives and sanctions are ineffective, as they can not be applied to the social context in northern Cameroon, also as a result of the pauperization of producers and several constraints which result in the inefficacy of actions. This situation has led to the fall of the cotton sector, with consequences on regional economy and socioeconomic development. Hence, producers develop multifunctional strategies with a focus on diversification. However, despite these efforts, producers face inevitable poverty and food security is also threatened. We thus conclude that better and more efficient coordination of actors in a crisis context is necessary to revamp the cotton sector and fight poverty"

"The aim of this thesis is to study the evolution of urban hierarchies and the nature of urban growth in the emerging countries, by focusing on the cases of China and India. According to this thesis, urban growth is a random growth process, except when institutionaly coordinated, that is, when legislation restrictions limit the firms and households' migration flows. This means that, in general, urban growth is independent from city size, which confirms Gibrat's law. In the long run, this leads in changes in the ranks of cities, when classified according to their size, but not in the hierarchical structure of the urban system, which follows Zip's law. The empirics of this thesis use two methodological sets : firsly, they apply the rank-size models in order to understand the evolutions of Chinese and Indian urban hierarchies between 1981 and 2004. Secondly, they use different parametrical and non parametrical tools, in order to analyse the nature of urban growth and, moreover, the relation between city-size and city-growth, for the two countries.

"The dissertation provides evidence on the agricultural decisions of rural Ugandan households in terms of risk management against weather variability. First, I study the impact of remittances sent by migrants on households' degree of crop specialization and crop riskiness, as remittances may, to some extent, relieve credit and risk constraints. I complete the first objective with a second analysis that explores if remittances can motivate households to use riskier inputs - fertilizers. Third, I examine whether land fragmentation can reduce the negative impacts of rainfall variability on farmers' crop yields. In the final chapter, I test whether inequality in access to water for consumption may increase the incidence and the intensity of low-level conflicts. The central and common theme of the different chapters is weather variability: what are the consequences for agricultural households, how can households protect themselves against weather fluctuations and what are the implications for water availability and social conflict. Those are the questions that the dissertation aims at addressing with a micro-level empirical approach."
"In the early 1980s, Chinese government has adopted an opening up policy in order to attract capital, skills and modern advanced technology that are necessary for the economic development of China. 	Indeed, this policy has already borne fruit. China, that was almost self-sufficient until the 1980s, has now become the largest exporter and the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in the world. Until now, most of the research on the economic opening up policy of China, however, has concentrated on the demonstration of the positive effects of exports and FDI inflows on the domestic economy of China. In this thesis, based on the analysis of economics of production, we study the relationship between the exchange rate of the yuan, export, foreign direct investment and income. We show that the opening up policy conducted by the Chinese government since the 1980s does not really benefit most of the residents in China. Based on the concept of inflation of monetary imbalances, we explain that the net export and entry of foreign direct investment in China have resulted in the inflationary pressures, degradation of real purchasing power of the majority of residents and increasing economic inequalities. These effects can’t be remedied by the monetary policy of the Central Bank of China. In addition, the monetary policy is likely to cause a malfunction of the Chinese economy to an extent that increases the financial difficulties of many firms, especially those small ones. That is what we are trying to prove in this thesis"
"Agriculture is facing an environmental crisis that makes it necessary to take into account the “ecosystem” functioning. But this concept of ecology is difficult to handle in the agricultural sector. Fields of literature on the ""commons"" and the ""ecosystem services"", which deal with the management of ecosystems, have been extensively developed and relayed by public policy. The thesis shows that they often freeze the conflict between agricultural objectives and environmental concerns without allowing the exploration of new farming systems.Our thesis in management science highlights the fact that a new challenge for scientific research is to learn to manage environmental regulations within agro-ecosystems in order to make agriculture sustainable. It aims to define a design approach of agro-ecosystems: can innovative design be applied to them? What are the methods to design agro-ecosystems? And what are the appropriate modes of governance?The historical analysis of scientific reasoning in agronomy and ecology highlights the reasons why the design of agro-ecosystems remains so difficult, despite finer knowledge on environmental regulations. The thesis models a particular class of objects, the “ecological fund” that scientists introduced to deal with agro-ecosystems while escaping the already known patterns. It shows the importance of considering the ecological funds not as common goods but as ""common unknowns”. The proposed model, tested on an archetype of an intensive cereal production area, makes it possible to develop a method of collective and innovative design of agro-ecosystems."
"Fair value measurement greatly changes the valuation of financial instruments held by banks. Thethesis examines the fair value relevance thought corporate governance and banking regulation.The international IFRS 13 standards and SFAS 157 standard in the United States require firms topublish fair value valuation techniques on the balance sheet into three levels in order to improveinternational comparability and information transparency. Firstly, an association study between fairvalues and market values is used to estimate the fair value relevance on an international sample of 730banks between 2008 and 2012. Using a modified Ohlson (1995) model, results show that fair valuerelevance is positively associated with the asset size of the bank and depends on the country. Then, astudy of the interaction between governance mechanisms and the fair value relevance tend to showthat investors would further value accounting information at fair value in the presence of governancemechanisms, particularly when the measurement is less reliable. Finally, the study of the link betweenstandardization and regulation shows that fair value valuation of level 2 assets is negatively associatedwith banks market risk, which can improve the effectiveness of market discipline."
"This thesis aims to analyze the impact of the creation of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), a regional trade agreements (RTAs) example on the dynamics of trade and development in this area. It analyzes the process of real convergence and examines opportunities to strengthen the integration process. The first chapter focuses on the impact of integration on reducing disparities in per capita income between member countries. Measured by the standard deviation of per capita GDP at constant prices of 2005, these analyzes revealed that the WAEMU countries are experiencing a real convergence between 1970 and 2010. However, according to our analysis, the creation of teh WAEMU has not significantly improved living conditions in memeber countries. The idea expressed in the first chapter is a regional trade agreements (RTAs) which brings together more or less equal partners and aims not only to promote trade themselves, but also and especially the integration and developemnt, may be a useful adjunct for multilateralism in the sense that it allows to correct inefficiencies and absorb its impact. On the other side, some RTAs can pose serious threats to the multilateral trading system from the moment they generate imbalances and reinforce inequalities between those who sign them. This is the case of many RTAs involving developing and developed countries. The second chapter focuses on one example of this type of RTAs and proposes a strategy to reduce the negative effects and to enable developing countries to reap the benefits of free trade. The analysis is done on the macroeconomic implications of economic partnership agreements(EPAs) between the countries of the European Union and those of the African Caribbean and Pacific. We show, using data from Côte d'Ivoire that, with productive public spending, developing countries can reudce the negative effects of short-term EPA. Developing countries are so small and too weak to cope with foreign competition that they implement protectionist policies such as the introduction of a tariff on imports. This is the case of the common external tariff imposed by the WAEMU imports from third countries. Chapter three of this tesis proposes a simple DGSE model, to assess macroeconomic impacts of this change in tariff structure. It appears that the net effect of a tariff reduction is the decrease of the main components of domestic demand and a lower level of consumer utility. The analysis shows that the dynamics of medium and long term as well as the instantaneous reaction of theses components depend on the elasticity of substitution between varieties of imported goods."
"The predominance of the informal sector in the economy of Haiti, where more than 80% of the population lives below the threshold of poverty and more than 35% unemployed, suggests links between the informal economy, poverty and the labour market. Highlight these interrelationships, requires an assessment of the informal economy, which is the subject of the four chapters of this thesis, dealing successively with the evolution of the macroeconomic situation, human capital, the informal earnings of workers, and the segmentation of the labour market.The first chapter made a diagnosis of the phenomenon according to the State of affairs of the developed theories and the evolution of the macroeconomic framework of Haiti from 1980 to 2010. And then offers a macroeconomic assessment of the informal sector as a percentage of GDP from a PLS (Partial Least Squares).Chapter two sets out the relationship between the evolution of the informal economy, deregulation and neo-liberal policies through a LISREL (Linear Structural Relations) model. We look at the impact of the budgetary, fiscal and monetary policies of the past 30 years on the informal economy. We also reassess the causes of the evolution of the informal economy generally evoked by the empirical studies (taxes, social security).In the chapter three, we analyse the micro-real dimension of the informal economy through a model of the Mincer earnings estimated by the equations logit from data in a national survey on employment and the informal economy (EEEI) in 2007. We analyse the determinants of informal gains in terms of the position of the market workers (employees, entrepreneurs and self-employed); and revenues (formal and informal) and the socio-economic characteristics of the working poor and non-poor compared to the poverty line.In chapter four, we first test the competitiveness and the segmentation of the labour market by making use of model of Roy and the expanded Roy model through an estimate a model Tobit. We use a model of Dirichlet process: first analyse the segmentation and possible informal work and market competitiveness as its determinants, according to data from the EEEI 2007; then, to distinguish the fundamental characteristics of the involuntary informal (excluded from the formal labour market) than the voluntary informal who gain comparative advantages."
"The rise of emerging economies and their increasing contributions to the world’s economy has led to the development of the science of economics. China is a typical representative of emerging market economies. This economic phenomenon pushes the development of economic growth theory, and the problems in empirical analyses also promote econometric techniques. Though China is still a developing country, China has successfully dragged itself out of absolute poverty. Is the technique of China’s economic development an alternative method for the struggle against the poverty of other poor countries? With the lack of modern international standard data, the empirical analyses of modern economic growth theories in the literature are generally focused on the period after the opening-up reform in 1978 or the period after the fiscal reform in 1993. In this thesis, the author attempts to extend the vision, by further analyzing China’s economy using modern economic approaches since the foundation of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Alongside the wave of privatization, marketization, and liberalization in the countries of the former Soviet Union, socialist countries, and developing countries, China has also begun its economic reform since 1978 in which it has achieved great economic success. Chinese policymakers themselves contribute the rapid economic growth to the success of the institutional choice. For instance, Hu Jintao’s report at the 17th Party Congress (2007) has the following assertion: “To sum up, the fundamental reason behind all our achievements and progress since the reform and opening up policy was introduced is that we have blazed a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and established a system of theories of socialism with Chinese characteristics.” However, what does the so-called “socialism with Chinese characteristics” really mean? How does it work on the path of economic growth? All those interesting questions incite this thesis to explore the answers. [...]"
"Nowadays, a record number of households are runned by single fathers not only in France but also in most of western societies. Our research aims to explore how single fathers experience the domestic sphere, a traditionally feminized field, while accomplishing their role of fathers. These fathers are living a situation of cumulating roles: the role of the father and the role of the mother. We identify three main categories of single fathers depending on their strategies to copy and/or delegate the role of the mother. Household duties such as shopping, cooking and housekeeping in addition to the nurturing role are experienced by many of the respondents as constructing elements of their fatherhood. Moreover, we identify the role of the marketplace and consumption in building a new family, particularly by creating new relationships between single fathers and their children."
"The notion of poverty has been the subject of much debate around the world. Previous analyses have emphasized the one-dimensional character based essentially on a monetary approach (income or consumption expenditure). Thanks to the work of some authors such as Townsend and Sen, the multidimensional character is highlighted, considering the difficulty of quantifying certain variables that translated the idea of lack. In addition, many empirical studies show that the rural sector remains the most affected by poverty.In the case of Côte d'Ivoire, poverty is also a rural phenomenon and most studies have focused on the monetary approach.This study addresses the analysis of poverty by focusing on rural farming and apprehends the phenomenon of poverty from three (03) approaches: (i) monetary; (ii) relative deprivation and (iii) wealth.The results show that poverty remains important in this sector with a high rate for the indicator of the relative deprivation. In addition, there is greater monetary inequality than other types of poverty whatever the year (2002 and 2008).The identification of the explanatory factors of the membership or not in the class of the poor shows that the variables related to the gender, to the type of religion and the age group are the most common in the various years and various approaches.Based on the obtained results , the following recommendations are formulated: (i) towards the Ivorian government, use monetary and non-monetary approaches in next analyses on poverty in Côte d’Ivoire; emphasize the construction of new infrastructures and the purchase of new equipment; improve communication about government actions; build the capacity of producers to use improved inputs and relevant tools; (ii) to agricultural producers, adopt agricultural technologies and techniques and quality inputs, accept to join cooperative enterprises; (iii) for cooperatives, it is necessary to look for outlets for its members, to negotiate better remunerations for agricultural productions, to transform farmers into real agricultural entrepreneurs."
"In order to prevent faults to happen and their catastrophic consequences, some organizations adopt operational modes allowing them to ensure a high degree of reliability and resilience. This research focuses on formalizing these operational modes through a processual approach to organizational reliability and resilience of a critical-care unit. We aim to study, on the one hand, how the processes unfold in the operational context facing real-life situations and, on the other hand, the impact of the organizational context on reliability and resilience.Studying a French critical-care unit, first-order results describe the different processes – at both organizational and situational levels of analysis – contributing to the organizational reliability and resilience: culture, integration of new members, trust, coordination, learning and organizational slack.Second-order results address patient-care situations as a continuum and we highlight the inflection points of the different patient-care trajectories. Saturation of the unit, management of the unexpected and of the situational slack enable critical-care unit’s members to cope with the volatility and the life-threatening emergency of situations demanding immediate action.We also study the links between the organizational and the situational levels of analysis by proposing a reinterpretation of the concept of discussion space (Detchessahar, 2003).Finally, our findings invite us to consider the tension in hospitals regarding the resources needed to maintain organizational reliability and resilience."
"An effective and efficient public-sector reform enhances government capability to raise domestic revenue for prioritized spending. It also contributes to strengthening the government capacity to manage public resources more effectively and deliver public services. In pursuing these objectives, fiscal decentralization, the devolution of taxing and spending powers to lower levels of government, has become a key public-sector reform in many countries. Given such high stakes, a growing economic literature is focusing on how to better understand the challenges developing countries face in implementing fiscal decentralization reforms. The present thesis adds to this effort through four contributions shedding light on specific issues related to fiscal decentralization.Chapter 1 analyses whether and how municipal revenue mobilization could enhance citizens’ access to public services and reduce poverty. The results indicate that increasing municipal-raised revenues improve access to public services and reduce poverty. This effect works mainly through enhancing access to education than on access to health, especially in less ethnically diverse localities and in urban zones. Chapter 2 investigates the effect of municipal revenue autonomy on inequalities within sub-national governments. We conclude that higher local revenue autonomy reduces income inequalities within localities, which effect differs between the type of revenue and jurisdiction considered. Chapter 3 analyzes the impact of the transfers from central government to municipalities on the revenue mobilization by municipalities. Our results show that increasing central transfers to subnational government boost revenue mobilization by municipalities for both tax revenue and non-tax revenue. The effect of transfers is found to be higher for tax revenue than for non-tax revenue. Finally, we examine whether the effect of government responsiveness on property tax compliance differs between central government and municipalities in chapter 4. The results conclude that responsiveness by municipalities is found to have a greater effect on property tax compliance than those by central governments. The results of our analysis bear important policy implications to strengthen public sector, especially in sub-Saharan Africa."
"At the end of the economic transition and in the context of catching up within the European Union, this thesis studies the technology transfer associated with foreign direct investment (FDI) in Central and Eastern Europe. Technological externalities are considered the main contribution of FDI to the economic development of host countries. The first part of this work analyzes the microeconomic mechanism of technology transfer. After having evaluated the potential for spillovers through the productivity gap and the intensity of intersectoral linkages, we identify the impact of technological spillovers on the productivity of domestic firms. We construct several measures of horizontal and vertical externalities, while giving particular attention to local firm’s status throughout the supply chain. Finally, we tested the role of local absorptive capacity and technological gap in the capture of spillovers. In the second part we conduct a macroeconomic analysis oriented on two directions: the relationship between FDI and local investment and the aggregate impact of FDI on growth. We start from the assumption of destructive creation between FDI and local investment and analyze this issue from the perspective of different types of FDI. We also separate the interaction mechanism between the affiliates and the domestic firms according to the real market and the financial market. We then evaluate the contribution of aggregate externalities to technical progress, which allows us to illustrate the overall impact of FDI on economic growth. Finally, we consider the FDI-growth relationship from a double perspective, in order to show the existence of a virtuous circle"
"This thesis focuses on the Social Responsibility of Small and Medium Enterprises in a particular context, namely Morocco.It aims to explore the relationship between the strategic vision of CEOs and CSR in SMEs, and the reasons for thestrategic integration of the principles of social responsibility in these structures through the concept of strategic vision.The interest in mobilizing this concept is justified by its ability to shed light on the implicit and informal aspect thatcharacterizes SME strategies, including the CSR strategy.The first part of this thesis is devoted to the elaboration of the conceptual framework of research, articulating thefoundations of the strategic vision, SMEs and their CSR and analyzingthe contribution of the concept of the strategicvision to understand the CSR strategy in the SMEs. The second part of the thesis aproaches empirically the problematicof our research. The close relationship between SMEs and their contexts influences both their perception and their CSRapproach. Before starting our case study, a contextualization process was therefore necessary to adapt our literature to theMoroccan reality. Our qualitative exploratory study focuses on four cases of Moroccan SMEs labeléd CSR. It highlightsthe relationship between CSR in SMEs and the strategic vision of the executive and the factors that build this strategic visions integrating CSR. Finally, we propose a typology of four strategic visions of CEOs of Moroccan SMEs labeled."
"The framework of Geweke (1982, 1984) improved by Chen et al. (2008)is used in this thesis to conduct Granger causality between finance and growth in the context of West Africa. We adopt the time - and frequency- approaches to bring out instantaneous causality and dependence by employing vector autoregressive models. In this work, we propose p-values computations more suitable for small sample size. Empirical investigations examine, successively, causal links between finance and growth, the impact of inflation on these links, and the conditional relationships between growth and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to financial development and economic openness."
"Outsourcing, paradoxically represents an opportunity, an issue and a risk. In fact, it is relevant to understand the phenomenon in depth. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the different phases of the process, why outsource and how to deal with any possible perverse effect. The public person, under a budget constraint, chooses to call on the private sector to control costs. We observe, however, that this objective is not achieved. This thesis tries to look for the real legitimacy of a public-private partnership. A triangulation of four information sources has given rise to the following report: an interest for the skills emerges to the detriment of the budget cut. Relying on the literature and several projects observation, we find out, within the framework of a more socio-philosophical vision, that public-private partnerships are part of a new world of consumption, liquid society."
"The first essay investigates dividend policy in Vietnamese stock market which is newly established and experiences short booming and crashing periods with a two-step approach. The research findings show: (1) investors are expropriated more in firms with higher insider ownership; (2) Investors tend to receive smaller dividends paid as a signal of expected profitability when information asymmetry is lower; (3) investors in state-controlled firms are more likely to receive dividends than those in non-state-controlled firms. The second essay posits that Vietnamese stock market is a promising laboratory to investigate stock price behavior on ex-dividend day. The research results imply that investors in Vietnamese stock market is indifferent to the difference in tax treatment of capital gains to dividends, they try to capture dividends if they find profit opportunities. Therefore, investors buy stocks on the cum-dividend day and sell them on the exdividend to exploit profit opportunities created by dividend payment. The third essay examines the effects of shareholder rights and creditor rights on dividend policy when agency costs of shareholders and creditors tend to increase. Its findings indicate that are more expropriated and theincrease in the expropriation of creditors (shareholders) is higher if shareholders (creditors) are protected strongly by law."

"In this thesis, we demonstrate the need for ownership of Competitive Intelligence (CI) as a culture and way of governance alternative that can help a developing country to face the triple challenges and issues. Those related to underdevelopment, alternative development and globalization. EI ownership in the particular context of the Congolese economy into a mode of governance for development and coopétitivité thus refers to two requirements. The first is to revisit the IE to showcase its advances, revealing its limitations and to enhance response capability tailored to the needs of a developing country. The second requirement is to analyze the scope of appropriation of IE in order to identify the nature, to raise the profile and articulate its elements to those means which the IE can now acquired plasticity of be adapted to contingency under consideration. The objective is to propose ways relevant to the efficient implementation of EI. The conceptualization of intelligence procedures and economic security (2S-MOSES) pegged to device strategic and operational development (OD-DS), the ""M'BONGUI"" and the pattern of systemic dominance analysis allows us to meet both requirements. The use of the incremental approach through transculturation also allows us to present the actual procedures of appropriation of the IE through the action of the General Directorate of the Economy (DGE) vector process that bothnational fora, that the education system and in the entrepreneurial sphere. A series of recommendations which define elements of a public policy of IE, the setting up of an IE and an information system that meets the needs of functional governance, operational and strategic are been proposed."
"Graph theory has long been studied in mathematics and probability as a tool for describing dependence between nodes. However, only recently it has been implemented on data, giving birth to the statistical analysis of real networks.The topology of economic and financial networks is remarkably complex: it is generally unobserved, thus requiring adequate inferential procedures for it estimation, moreover not only the nodes, but the structure of dependence itself evolves over time. Statistical and econometric tools for modelling the dynamics of change of the network structure are lacking, despite their increasing requirement in several fields of research. At the same time, with the beginning of the era of “Big data” the size of available datasets is becoming increasingly high and their internal structure is growing in complexity, hampering traditional inferential processes in multiple cases.This thesis aims at contributing to this newborn field of literature which joins probability, economics, physics and sociology by proposing novel statistical and econometric methodologies for the study of the temporal evolution of network structures of medium-high dimension."
"Collaborative consumption is often presented as the new economy of sharing and advocates usage vs. ownership. However, it seems that certain collaborative practices are sources of hyperconsumption and that they actually encourage consumerism. As part of this doctoral research, we seek to identify and understand the rise of commercial skills among consumers. We take a sociotechnical dispositives approach to study this process in the context of collaborative consumption. Our results demonstrate that certain collaborative practices allow the expression of the entrepreneurial subject and fuel the neoliberal logic rather than question it. They also show that socio-technical dispositives are omnipresent and capable of mass shaping consumers, leading them to behave like consumer-seller within a ""consumerist"" heterotopy. Furthermore, our results reveal how the consumersellers studied, in the context of a jumble sale, certainly develop their entrepreneurship but nevertheless want to preserve a certain distance between game and reality to continue to ""play shop""."
"This thesis comprises four empirical essays on environmental and development economics. In the first chapter, we examine to what extent individual and contextual level factors influence individuals to contribute financially to prevent environmental pollution. We find that rich people, individuals with higher education, as well as those who possess post-materialist values are more likely to be concerned about environmental pollution. We also observe the country in which individuals live matter in their willingness to contribute. More precisely, we find democracy and government stability reduce individuals’ intention to donate to prevent environmental damage mainly in developed countries. The second chapter deals with the relation between economic growth and environmental degradation by focusing on the issue of whether the inverted U-shaped relation exist. The study discloses no evidence for the U-shaped relation. However, the empirical result points toward a non-linear relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth, that is, emissions tend to rise rapidly in the early stages with economic growth, and then emissions continue to increase but a lower rate in the later stages. The third chapter investigates the long-run as well as the causal relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in a group of Sub-Saharan Africa. The result discovers the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between clean energy consumption and economic growth. Furthermore, the short-run and the long-run dynamics indicate unidirectional Granger causality running from clean energy consumption to economic growth without any feedback effects. The last chapter of this thesis concerns with convergence of emissions across Canadian provinces. The study determines convergence clubs better characterizes Canadian’s emissions. In other words, we detect the existence of segmentation in emissions across Canadian provinces."
"This thesis aims to contribute to recent studies which carry out the effects of government expenditure, taxation, public debt, and total factor productivity on economic growth, especially in case of Vietnam. Before going to further, this thesis introduces an overview onVietnam’s economy context in some recent decades. For instance, economic growth, inflation control, taxation system and its renewal, poverty reduction, and public debt issue. First, this thesis distinguishes public debt by two types, domestic and external debt and delivers a main message that an increase of tax on returns to assets can positively impact the steady-state values of main macroeconomic variables expressed in ratios of physical capital (consumption, public expenditure, domestic debt). Second, among other production factors, only provincial labor force exerts a positive impact on the provincial economic growth while government expenditure has no significant effect on growth for our sample during the 2000-2007 period. Finally, decentralization in government expenditure will promote economic growth if the share of local government expenditure is low enough that determined by the ratio of elasticity of local government expenditure to sum of local government and central government elasticities. Estimation results show that decentralization in government expenditure in case of Vietnam has a positive impact on economic growth, the higher level of decentralization in government expenditure leads to higher economic growth."
"As part of the intersection of the fields of experiential marketing and the theories of information systems and human-computer interaction, this doctoral research work investigates the specificities of the shopping experience in a 3D commercial environment enriched with virtual reality devices. In particular, it studies the factors of access to the immersion and presence experience in thisenvironment and its consequences on behavioral intentions. The review of the literature and the triangulated qualitative phase made it possible to highlight the importance of three key factors of access to the experience and its enrichment as well as the central role of the immersion - presence process. An experiment implemented in a ""real"" commercial environment in 3D allowed us to studyconcomitantly the effects of the various factors namely: the navigability of the website (through a manipulation related to the presence / l lack of an interactive map), the sensory wealth of the commercial environment (through the manipulation of colors and diffused music) and sociability (through the manipulation of the presence / absence of 'a virtual seller) on sensory immersion and presence. The consequences on behavioral intentions have also been investigated. Theoretical,methodological and managerial contributions are numerous."
"The main objective of this thesis is to address emotions management in the implementation of a new integrated management software package. The joint aspects cognition-emotion in the human resources management allows to channel emotions and negative causes of resistance. We lead a longitudinal study (3 years and 6 months) in a law firm of international affairs. At the end of this study, we find that the support associated with emotional intelligence decreases cognitive and emotional dissonance, promotes the co-construction of change, and participates in the acceptance and appropriation of change."
"System thinking concepts and simulation tools are used to model the risk prevention plan and operational modes designed to enforce safety constraints at a French liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) storage and distribution facility. In France, such facilities are classified and the subject of special legislation and safety regulations. Their supervision is the responsibility of a control and regulatory body. A technological risk and prevention plan is provided, where all the dangerous phenomena likely to occur in addition to the safety control measures are listed in the safety report. Safety is therefore addressed through rules, and control mechanisms ensure that the system complies with safety constraints. Taking this facility as a case study, we use the STAMP theoretical framework together with AnyLogic simulation software to model technical elements and human and organizational behavior. We simulate how the system evolves over time and the strategies that are deployed in a loss of control scenario. The aim is to assess whether the prescribed safety program covers all of the system's phases; namely operations and audits. The results enrich other research that focuses on the contribution of system dynamics to risk analysis and accident prevention."
"This dissertation provides a history of macroeconomic modeling practices from RobertE. Lucas’s works in the 1970s up to today’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) approach. Working from a historical perspective, I suggest that the recent rise of DSGE models should be characterized as a compromise between opposing views of modeling methodology—on the one hand, the real business cycle (RBC) view, on the other hand, the new Keynesian view. In order to justify this claim, my work provides an epistemological reconstruction of the recent history of macroeconomics, building from ananalysis of the criteria defining the validity and the pertinence of a model. My assumption is that recent macroeconomic modeling practices can be described by three distinctive methodological criteria : the internal validity criterion (which establishes the consistency between models’ assumptions and concepts and formalisms of a theory), the external validity criterion (which establishes the consistency between the assumptions and results of a model and the real world, as well as the quantitative methods needed to assess such a consistency) and the hierarchization criterion (which establishes the preference for internal over external validity, or vice versa). This epistemological reconstruction draws primarily from the literature about models in the philosophy of science. My work aims to make four contributions to the history of recent macroeconomics. (1) To understand the rise of DSGE models without referring to the explanation providedby the macroeconomists themselves, who tend to think that macroeconomics evolved through theoretical consensus and exogenous technical progress. By distancing itself fromthis perspective, my work draws attention to the disruptive character of methodological controversies and to the interdependence between theoretical activity and the developmentof statistical and econometric methods. (2) To overcome the existing divide betweenthe history of macroeconomic theories and the history of quantitative methods. Throughits epistemological perspective, my work reconciles these two historiographies and specifiesthe basis for a comprehensive understanding of recent developments in macroeconomics.(3) To put the accent on the external validity condition as the main controversial issue separating different views of macro-modeling methodology. Furthermore, I illustrate how the debate about external validity is closely related to the problem of casual explanation and, finally, to the conditions for providing economic policy evaluation. (4) To characterize the DSGE approach: although DSGE models are often presented as a“synthesis”, or as a “consensus”, they are better described as a shaky compromise between two opposing methodological visions."
"The inventory management and transportation are two main activities of supply chain management. The joint optimization of these two activities is known as Inventory Routing Problem (IRP). The main objective of IRP is to determine the set of retailers to be delivered to in each period, the delivery sequence for each vehicle, and the quantities of goods delivered to each retailer for each period of a planning horizon. The traditional IRPs are faced different problems, caused mainly by lack of complete and/or timely information such as shifts in demand, traffic caused by a sudden vehicles accident, etc. sharing of updated and reliable logistics information can meaningful improve the efficiency of IRP. Moreover, because of the specificity of IRP in urban logistic, it is important to tack into account other criteria as social, environmental criteria and service level that could be in conflict. The main objective of this thesis is to (i) choose appropriate social, environmental and service level criteria, (ii) integrate them in mathematical models, and (iii) study the impact of these criteria on dynamic optimization of IRPs for perishable products under uncertain parameters. For this purpose, three mathematical models are proposed. The first model is multi-objective mathematical model in order to make a trade-off between service level, environmental criteria and economic. To decrease quantity of expired products, a nonlinear step function as holding cost function is integrated in the model. Moreover, to solve the problem a fuzzy possibilistic approach is applied to handle uncertain parameters. In the second model, a bi-objective mathematical model is proposed to study impact of social issues on the IRPs. In the proposed model, first objective function concerns economic criteria while the second one social issues. A scenario-based stochastic approach is developed to cope with uncertainty in the model. Finally, the third model concerns impact of using real-time information in efficiency of IRPs. It is noteworthy that, according significant role of perishable products in the both financially and ecology sides of IRPs, perishable products  are considered in all three proposed model while even proposed models are appropriate to nonperishable ones as well. The results show that a dynamic management is more efficient than the static one."
"How to facilitate the integration’s of the ICT in the SME? This is the question asked by the Colombian’s Government since the end of the nineties.Seven years after defining the regional strategy eLAC 2007 and twelve years after the signature of the Florianopolis’ Declaration, we open a new way of thinking about the impact of the actions developed by the Colombian’s Government in order to promote the ICT in the micros, smalls and mediums companies between 2000 and 2010.The study of various sources available in this area, together with the achievement of several interviews and the application of a survey instrument, allowed us to define the context and the global issue of the ICT integration in the SME from three points of view such as: the orientation of the Public Policies ICT, the programs’ application, and the scope of the Governments’ strategy.This research’s program helped us to identify the major obstacles in the participation of the SME in the Information Society, and to generate a series of conclusions and recommendations which can contribute to improve the Government’s action. This will give it one more chance to reach the objectives fixed by the National Development Plan."
"This thesis uses a political economy frame to analyze Thailand’s health system and its inequalities in health. After identifying the political actors of the health care system and the ideologies on which they are based, it examines the way in which the policies put in work have affected the health and the distribution of health. In Thailand, national trilogy ""Nation-Buddhism-King"" impregnated the whole political pattern, including health system. It also influenced political agents and political decision-makers in building the Thai social protection system. Influenced by utilitarianism and nationalism, the Ministry of Health had prioritized efficiency, rather than equality, and improved population health in order to increase economic growth. Due to Buddhism, some technocrats have launched health promotion policies based on the concept of Karma that reinforced individual responsibility for health, but ignored social inequalities that affected health-risk behaviors. Royal charities have provided health care for marginalized groups for long times, but many patients still were left untreated. Thanks to these actors, many health indicators were improved, but, at the same time, it increased health disparities between rich and poor, rural areas and urban areas, as between Bangkok and the poorest regions, North and Northeast. In 2001, Thai Rak Thai party launched a new health insurance program providing basic health care for all Thais.  Although many reports confirmed the good results of a policy that reduced some inequalities and improved health care access for the poor, it raised the opposition from several stake-holders groups. This new program, based on equal opportunities and the right to health, unintentionally challenged the old policies and the old ideologies in health care justice. As a result, conflicts in health system as well as political instability as a whole constrained the development of new health policies for the next generations."
"Hospitality is a vast concept that has been studied by various disciplines. It has to be distinguished from welcome and service. Based on the definition of hospitality as «the sharing of one's own home», this thesis argues that tourism is the occasion of gestures of hospitality. Three frameworks of tourism hospitality are identified: territory, residence and commercial organization. Territorial tourism hospitality is perceived by foreign tourist when they meet the residents (local population, service employees) of a destination and service facilities and equipment. A case study concerns a destination in the french west indies, Guadeloupe. Dimensions of territorial tourist hospitality are determined. B&B houses offer domestic and commercial tourist hospitality. Several qualitative and quantitative studies demonstrate that not hospitable people, is a antecedent of the satisfaction perceveid by the guests in a B&B house. "
"This research proposes to study the dimensions that compose the wellbeing at work from the worker perspective. It aims also to propose a measure scale of wellbeing at work specific to the French context. For this purpose, an analysis of the literature related to the concepts of wellbeing in general and wellbeing at work specifically is carried out. It allowed to identify the variables considered by researchers as antecedents or consequences of wellbeing at work. Also, an analysis of the measures of wellbeing at work proposed by academics and professionals in HR consulting is realized. It put forwards two main established measure scales of wellbeing at work, those of Dagenais-Desmarais (2010) and Bietry & Creusier (2013). This theoretical work is followed by an empirical study that consisted in a qualitative and a quantitative researches. The qualitative study, which is part of an exploratory approach, consisted of 29 individual interviews and 5 focus groups conducted within the same service company. This study brings out the representations of well-being at work among employees that are summarized in six main dimensions : (1) the role clarity, (2) the working environment, (3) the working atmosphere, (4) the recognition at work, (5) the corporate benevolence and (6) the professional fulfilment. The validity of content of the resulting conceptualizations of wellbeing at work is tested using the method of card-sorting. This exploratory approach, which allowed to propose a conceptual model that highlights the six dimensions of BET presented above, is followed by a quantitative study. This study consisted in the proposal and the testing of a measure scale of wellbeing at work. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of the structure of the measure scale is done. Their results confirm the reliability of the considered six-dimensions of wellbeing at work.  Also, the analysis of the reliability and the different aspects of validity - convergent, discriminant and nomological - of the scale using the method of structural equations modeling asserts the satisfying psychometric properties of the proposed scale of wellbeing at work. The results of the test of the scale are then discussed in regard to the literature background related to the considered dimensions. Their managerial implications are also presented, their limits as well as the opportunities of improvement presented and discussed."
"This PhD thesis addresses the issue of assessing the impacts of various climate policies on the French forest sector. It starts from the observation that, in France, most climate policies are based upon the stimulation of additional fuelwood consumption through bottom-up processes. Besides assessing the economic and environmental impacts of these fuelwood policies, we also analyze the impacts of two alternatives climate policies : a policy based upon carbon sequestration in forest and a policy to stimulate the forest sector through a top-down carbon tax policy. In order to test these policies, we develop a bio-economic model of the French sector called French forest sector model (FFSM). It contains two interconnected modules: the economic module represents the economy of the national forest sector in a partial equilibrium framework while the biological module represents the French forest resources dynamics. FFSM takes into account the consumption of 6 final products, the production of 3 primary products and represents tradesbetween the 22 French administrative regions and between France and the rest of the world. From FFSM, we assess the economic effectiveness of policies by interpreting policies costs and by measuring the impacts on the sector through economic variables. We also assess the environmental effectiveness by comparing their carbon balances and their impacts on the forest resource dynamics."
"In the context of intense international competition, many manufacturing firms are directing their investments toward African markets to increase their market share and maintain their competitiveness in the global market. These markets are rapidly growing but require customized products. Despite their attractivity, trade flows in Africa remain low due to the poor quality of infrastructure and the lack of regional logistic ecosystems, connecting African countries through reliable and efficient services.This doctoral thesis therefore focuses on modelling and solving the problem of designing hybrid distribution networks in Africa, integrating distribution and final customization platforms. These networks incorporate, upstream, regional hubs that serve as gateways to regional markets. The postponement of final customization downstream of the logistics network reduces the delivery times and downstream distribution costs while maintaining upstream economies of scale.The methodology we suggest is based on two main areas of research:▪ The first axis aims to define the location of regional logistics hubs, based on a fuzzy multi-criteria analysis approach, which is an improved version of TOPSIS fuzzy and AHP;▪ The second axis focuses on the design of hybrid distribution networks serving highly diversified markets in Africa (for example: fertilizer markets). To this aim, we propose two new multi-objective optimization models minimizing total operating and investment costs, maximizing product proximity to markets and minimizing damage to finished products during their distribution. The first model is deterministic while the second one proposes a flexible design in response to the dynamics and uncertainty of the evolution of African markets."
"In 2008, the World Bank has dedicated its ""Annual Report on Development"" to agriculture. This had not been the case for 25 years. It shows that agricultural growth is more effective than other sectors to reduce poverty. The agricultural labor productivity of the agricultural workforce is paradoxically barely mentioned: its explanatory factors for the short term as its structural variables in the long term are not analyzed. This thesis aims to contribute to a better understanding of the dynamic relationship between demography and non-agricultural development with agricultural development (increased productivity of agricultural labor). Under what demo-economic conditions can the structural transformation of an economy (i.e. the decline in the relative weight of the agricultural sector in the economy (workers and value added)) be accompanied by agricultural development? While an industrial or service sector that develops generally attracts workers, is there an opposite relationship in the agricultural sector? Does the agricultural sector have to lose its workers to develop? Has an agricultural sector ever developed in a context of continuous growth in the number of agricultural workers? Our main (hypo)thesis is that the dynamic combination of factors « land » and « agricultural worker », whose resultant is the « agricultural area worked per agricultural worker », is the real key to agricultural development, more than the productivity of the land.We analyze the determinants of the level and of the growth rate of the agricultural labor productivity over the 1980-2007 period, at different geographical levels. Special focus is put on the evolution of the « number of agricultural workers », using different sets of data (international, national, field surveys data), at different scales (world, Mexico, and 31 federal states 2400 Mexican municipalities) and with various methods (factor decomposition, maps, hierarchical ascending classifications, statistical inference, field surveys of farming households).Globally, we highlight a « race » between land and the number of agricultural workers in certain regions of the world and propose the concept of « demographic transition agriculture » and its associated typology.Mexico is then chosen for its agriculture showing very contrasting levels of development, for both synchronic and diachronic observation. We seek to understand the differences in agricultural development paths observed in Mexico by analyzing the influence of variables characterizing the non-farm economy, the substitution of machinery capital for labor, land liberalization, geography (physical and human).In international comparisons as within Mexico, we show that the growth rate of the area by agricultural worker has a marginally stronger influence on the growth rate of agricultural labor productivity, than the growth rate of land productivity.Finally, in the Municipality of Teopisca in the Los Altos region of Chiapas, we analyze the economic strategies of farm households « trapped » in a context of « blocked demographic agricultural transition » (downward trend of the agricultural area per worker): income diversification (toward the non-agricultural sector) and attempts to rise the land productivity are the two main strategies deployed under local severe constraints of market failures (labor, credit) and difficult access to irrigation water."
"International development assistance projects are extremely various. They have multiple objectives, take various forms and take place in contrasted contexts. This diversity causes a normative methodological discourse. Indeed, concerning the project’s performance evaluation, a single and unchangeable management tools is designed from the start to the end of project.This management tools is supposed to collect and process a large number of indicators also designed at the beginning, according to the project « logical framework ».  Tools conceives far away from the project and accountable to the donors. In reality, it can be seen that even projects with substantial resources struggle to master the process of evaluating performance. Few practitioners are successful in leading an evaluation of performance. Even few are the projects whose committee leaders use, for making decision, data from such evaluation. However, performance evaluation are systematically carried out within each international development aid project. This research proposes to explain the reasons of such paradox."
"The distinction between manufacturing and service jobs has lost some of its relevance due to the growing interpenetration between industrial and service activities. On the other hand, globalization has made it increasingly necessary to distinguish between jobs exposed to international competition (tradable jobs) and those not exposed to it (non-tradable jobs), found in primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. This thesis begins by analyzing the developments and characteristics of tradable and non-tradable employment in France. Which jobs are tradable and which are non-tradable? Are they different in terms of skills, wages, and productivity? How are they distributed around the country? It then studies the interdependencies between these two categories of employment, making an empirical evaluation of the local multiplier effect of tradable jobs on non-tradable jobs in French local labor markets. Lastly, the thesis focuses on workers laid off due to firm closure. It sets out to determine whether the risk of job displacement, and the associated costs, are higher in the tradable sector than in the non-tradable sector."
"It is now common knowledge to develop an ambidextrous organization in a ﬁrm to guarantee a competitive advantage in its environment. Such perspective is rooted in James March’s model (1991) whose purpose is to sustain organizational learning through adaptive mechanisms between agents. This model anchored in the tradition of problem-solving offers a behavioural approach coping with biases and heuristics of bounded rationality. In contrast, with literature models studying the balance between exploration and exploitation activities (ambidexterity), we demonstrate how exploration can be more generative if it uses exploitation constraints as prior knowledge to generate concepts. These rely on positively conditioning them by decision-making parameters contributing to exploitation. New decision situations are designed instead of traditionally selecting explorations. This model - decisional ambidexterity-allows building up projects capable of exploring conditions overcoming limitations and performances of exploitation. A collaborative research conducted at Zodiac Aerospace allowed revealing such new model. It extends organizational ambidexterity into the unknown, more adapted to innovation management & governance, whilst precising how to drive organization metabolisms inducing change among participating organizations in a conglomerate of SMEs."
"Managers use accounting information to justify workforce reductions and social stakeholders use this information to judge whether these operations are socially acceptable. Managers can thus use this information to mislead the social stakeholder judgements. This dissertation aims at studying managers’ accounting choices in the context of workforce reductions. Based on the stakeholder agency theory and the political cost hypothesis, we first examine whether managers reduce reported earnings downward before workforce reduction announcements. Our sample consists of 123 workforce reduction announcements for 107 French listed firms in a six-year period 2007-2012. Our results show that firms engage in income-decreasing discretionary accruals before workforce reduction announcements. Therefore, the context of workforce reductions can be considered as a relevant proxy to test the political cost hypothesis. Second, we investigate the factors influencing managers’ accounting choices. The size of the operation and the firms’ membership to sensitive industries reinforce the adoption of this accounting behavior. By contrast, the presence of employee representative on supervisory boards and the use of an independent chartered accountant to assist the works council constrain earnings management activities. Finally, we adopt an extensive definition of accounting choices and examine the association of earnings management and disclosure strategies at workforce reduction announcements. Our findings show that there is a substitutive relationship between earnings management and disclosure strategies."
"This thesis consists of three self-contained papers, each of which corresponds to one chapter. The first chapter, jointly written with Estelle Malavolti, studies the optimal design of delay reduction contract signed between an ANSP and a monopoly airline. In the contract design, we mainly consider the adverse selection problem. Moreover, we conduct comparative-static analysis to study the effects of safety standard and flight frequency on optimal contracts. Besides, we use numerical examples to study when a welfare-maximizing ANSP has to use public funds to provide the service. The second chapter investigates the dual roles of congestion delays and horizontal product differentiation in airline network choice. I find that, first, because of the inclusion of congestion delays, the airline may choose the point-to-point network even when the extra travel time disutility of one-stop services is relatively low. Second, without considering the airline's fixed investments of developing a hub airport, the 2-hub network will dominate the three other network structures as long as it is feasible, as it involves the horizontal product differentiation in more markets than the three other network structures. The third chapter, jointly written with Wanjun Yao and Shigeyuki Hamori, empirically finds that the higher land allocation efficiency improves the average land productivity by 29.1% and the larger average operational farm size reduces the average land productivity by 9.2%, implying that the agricultural land marketization in China finally improves the average land productivity by 19.9%."
"The underrection to news is one of the anomalies to the efficient market hypothesis. Several explanations to this phenomenon have been proposed by the behavioral finance. According to Grinblatt and Han (2005), this difference between the stock price and the fundamental value is due to the disposition effect. In order to study the adjustment of prices to the fundamental value, an experimental approach has been adopted. For each of the two studied treatments, six experimental sessions have been realized. 69 subjects have taken part to the first treatment and 72 to the second. The results prove an underreaction of prices to a fundamental value change in each of the treatments. This underreaction exists subsequent to the increases as well as to the decreases of the fundamental value. The results also indicate that the price-adjustment is low when most of the subjects negotiate the stock with a loss paper. Finally, the underreaction is at its lowest level when the subjects, in situation of paper gain, receive good news."
"Economics, as surveyed in Econlit and Business Source Complete journals, is strongly critical about the efficiency of cooperative firms. That survey is completed by a comparative analysis on employment characteristics in stock companies and cooperative firms (INSEE French data on 780 jobs in cooperatives and 26000 jobs in stock companies). Results are that cooperatives show a low degree of reactivity and expertise. Thus the understanding of the survival of cooperatives requires to show that the excessive hold of those principles of reactivity and expertise on current behaviors are sources of inefficiency (negative externalities, under-utilization of internal competences, etc), whereas the opposite principles of stability and experienced sense are sources of efficiency (tacit and informal knowledge of the environment). Expertise and reactivity form an abstract rationality while stability and experienced sense form a concrete one. Concrete and abstract rationalities are alternative viable sources of efficiency. But in a context where reactivity and expertise have an excessive hold on behaviours, it is necessary to promote stability and experienced sense, which the promotion of cooperative firms may ensure."
"Despite numerous investments that have been made to increase access to education in sub-Saharan Africa, a noteworthy share of children drop out of school prior to completing primary education. To address this issue, this thesis examines the factors that drive education decisions in a rural risky environment. The first chapter focuses on one of the core determinant of education investment that has been under-explored, the opportunity costs of education. To identify these costs that can significantly hinder education, we determine children's productivity on the farm and provide an estimate range of the value of one day of child labor. In order to better understand education decisions in rural sub-Saharan Africa, the second chapter assesses the different benefits of education in rural Tanzania, where family farm is the dominant structure in agriculture and where the technology level is low. Finally, the third chapter investigates whether productivity shocks are detrimental to educational achievement and children’s cognitive skills by considering two particular aspects, the age at which shocks occur, and the length of shocks. This subject is all the more relevant today when the number of productivity shocks is growing. Throughout these three chapters which focus on rural Tanzania, this thesis provides some insight into the role of public policies in protecting and promoting education."
"A key characteristic of the process of economic development is the shrinking spatial mismatch between economic activity and population. This thesis analyzes what happens when this spatial mismatch is reduced, as people’s places of residence and work or the geographical distribution of economic activity is altered. Chapter I deals with the relationship between international migrants and their households of origin. It sheds light on the importance for remittances and investments of migrants' beliefs and the information asymmetry between remittance senders and recipients that distance aggravates. Chapter II explores the transformation of the receiving economy due to an influx of rural-to-urban migrants in China. It first quantifies the effect of immigrants on the labor market at destination, and then investigates their impact on the reallocation of production factors and factor-market constraints faced by urban firms. Chapter III focuses on the long-term impact of a large industrialization plan in China. It reveals a reversal pattern due to the distortions in local labor markets induced by the presence of big plants. It highlights the role of migration in overcoming such imperfections and in bringing about the later stage of structural transformation—from heavy industry to consumption goods and services."
"The labor market is a central institution in any modern economy. At the same time, the labor market is characterized by pervasive regulation. Across nations, the labor market is subject to minimum wages, hiring and firing restrictions, compulsory collective bargaining, etc.  A recent and growing literature investigates the consequences of such heterogeneity in labor market institutions, studying how labor market rigidities affect the causes and consequences of policy changes. Thus far, however, few works have addressed the implications of labor market rigidities for trade-induced labor dynamics focusing on the informal sector, or the second moment shocks in an open economy setting. Important questions remain open for researchers and policymakers. The purpose of this thesis is to address these questions, studying the role of labor market frictions and its interaction with international trade and uncertainty.The first chapter investigates the impact of uncertainty shocks in a small open economy with search and matching frictions and firm entry. We first develop our empirical analysis in the context of the Korean economy, as all dimensions of the model are relevant in this country. An increase in uncertainty lowers output, consumption, investment and job finding rate, while raising unemployment and job separations. We also supplement the existing empirical evidence by looking at firm dynamics, real exchange rate and current account behavior. In our theoretical framework, we illustrate new transmissions mechanism that are ignored in the literature. Economic mechanisms go beyond the simple addition of each feature. Search frictions, firm entry and the open economy dimension actually strongly interact to amplify the effects of uncertainty shocks and make the model consistent with the empirical evidence.The second chapter studies how tax reforms help ensure a fair globalization. In this paper we develop a two-area model: a developed and an emerging country.  The two areas differ according to the size of the informal sector, which is characterized by a more flexible labor market and lower productivity. Our analysis suggests that trade liberalization boosts economic activity and employment in both the formal and informal sector. However, this employment expansion is biased toward the informal sector, which is not subject to labor regulation and hence more flexible. Hence, trade liberalization leads to lower employment quality, as informal workers are not covered by the labor legislation, social security and receive lower paid. A budget-neutral tax reform switching the tax burden from payroll taxes paid by firms operating in the formal sector to a consumption tax may represent a strategy to support the formal sector. However, formalization comes at the cost of widening income inequality between formal and informal workers.The third chapter assesses the importance of labor market institutions in the transmission of uncertainty shocks to labor markets. Using country-specific VARs across OECD countries, I find that there is substantial cross-country heterogeneity in the responses of unemployment rates to uncertainty shocks. I also provide evidence that this heterogeneity can be attributed to differential employment protection legislation (EPL). Low EPL countries suffer more severe rises in unemployment compared to high EPL countries following uncertainty shocks. Stricter EPL mutes the reaction of unemployment, making it more costly to lay workers off. Moreover, the second moment shock reinforces this mechanism through the real options channel. Under irreversibility and uncertainty, firing costs come with a bigger cost. On the other hand, the role of other labor market characteristics is ambiguous."
"This thesis is an attempt to improve the understanding of the causes of corruption emergence and incidence around the world. It highlights an undocumented feature of corrupt transactions, that is, their contribution to informal risk-Coping and risk-Management mechanisms used by economic agents to protect against income fluctuations. We propose in a first introductory chapter a general state of art of researches on corruption  definitions, measurements, typologies and determinants. In chapter two, we explain, apply and compare standard methods of computing instability indicators, using export revenue data from sample of developed  and developing countries. In chapter three, we build a retrospective Economic Vulnerability Index – i.e. an index reflecting the risk for a country of seeing its development hampered by natural and trade shocks – for a sample of 128 developing  countries over 1975-2008. In chapter 4, we analyse the effect of export instability on corruption in developed and developing countries. This effect is decomposed into an ex post effect, resulting from  agents’ experience of export instability, and an ex ante effect, resulting from their perception of export instability. We test empirically these effects using data on corruption perceptions and on firms’ bribe payments. We find robust, significant and nonlinear ex post and ex ante effects of  instability on corruption, and stress that their direction strongly depends on the frequency and size of export fluctuations. We show that the liquidity constraint is a key channel for these effects: when the liquidity constraint hardens, instability is found to foster corruption; while when it softens,  instability is found to reduce it. Thus, corrupt strategies may act as a substitute for financial market imperfections and a low state capacity for mitigating the consequences of economic fluctuations on welfare."
"This research is in the literature that analyzes the determinants of fiscal performance of developing countries. We are particularly interested in the question of revenue mobilization due to the issue that raises funding for development policies which developing countries have adopted. While many studies have focused on the subject, but few analyzes address the effects of shocks in revenue mobilization in developing countries. However, many developing countries are experiencing large shocks in high frequency. The understanding of the transmission mechanism of the effect of these shocks is crucial in the conduct of fiscal policy and the projection of the development policies of developing countries. The capital character of the mobilization of public resources for the economy of developing countries, and the not taking into account of the role of shocks in the conduct of public revenue mobilization by the previous studies are our main motivations for this research. Thus, the chapter 1 of the thesis analyzes te effects of commodity shocks on revenue mobilization of sub-Saharan Africa. The second chapter examines the role of commodity price shocks in export as in import in the conduct of tax transition reforms initiated by the states of the WAEMU. It highlights the obstacles posed by exogenous shocks to possibilities of domestic revenue mobilization face downward weight of tariff revenue. Chapter 3 analyzes the impact of sociopolitical shocks, especially the civil wars or intra-State conflicts. Finally, Chapter 4, an extension of Chapter 3 focuses on public resource mobilization during post-Conflict periods. The central message that emerges from this research is the need for rigor in developing countries in managing the impact of positive commodity shocks to cope with periods of negative shocks. This rigor must be complemented by external support suited to the nature of the shock episodes. Concerning the case of sociopolitical shocks, external support should not be only financial but also technical during post-Shock periods."
"This interdisciplinary thesis in economics and political science analyzes the multidimensional aspects of the governance doctrine in the agendas of multilateral and International Organizations (IOs) by adopting the framework of International Political Economy (IPE). The first part uses two chapters to analyze the doctrine of governance in its genesis, conceptualization, diffusion and appropriation in the international development community. Chapter 1 found that current approaches of governance break with traditional approaches of political legitimacy and economic efficiency by taking into account the hybridity, heterogeneity and multiplicity of stakeholders in decision-Making. Chapter 2 brings its contribution to the debate on ideas and norms diffusion in development policies scene by taking the example of the  world Bank and its agenda on governance norms. We show that the World Bank has developed different behaviors vis- à-Vis the governance doctrine, moving from economic to political and social approaches through a neoliberal framework. The World Bank’s smart power, based on its governance indicators, has been found to exert some notable influences on its foreign development assistance policies as well as those of the other key aid actors. Through two chapters, the second part investigates about social and environmental dimensions of governance in a perspective of sustainable development in developing countries. Chapter 3 studies the behaviors of IOs in terms ofsocial governance. Its empirical investigations, on the effects of multilateral aid on income inequalities and social protection in developing countries, show that aid has beneficial effects only in recipient countries presenting good governance policies. Ultimately, chapter 4 proposes a principal-Agent model highlighting some political economy interactions between supply and demand sides for good governance in the case of environmental compliance, corruption and deforestation in developing countries. This chapter shows empirically that multilateral aid, to the forestry sector, is more effective in reducing deforestation in countries presenting both a better environmental compliance and rule of law."
"Third-party logistics (3PL) seek performance by reorganizing regularly their warehouse operations. Few researchers study performance measurement systems (PMS) dedicated to 3PL. Researchers in warehousing design are used to study all the different operations one by one while these operations are linked together. As far as we know the literature does not propose any SMP for warehouse operations reorganization. SMP design leads to analyze the consequences for management control system, studied through Simons’ levers of control.An Intervention-research is conducted in a french 3PL : FM Logistic. Our contribution is the design of a performance measurement system in the form of problem graph which linking both knowledge advocated by a French 3PL and quoted in the literature. This SMP has been designed using a semantic and a syntax inspired by TRIZ problem graph. SMP design enables to analyze interactivity development. Results show the development of diagnostics systems towards interactivity."
"In an uncertain environment that is also marked by a growing instability, firms try to seek a global and sustainable performance which is considered as a lever not only for longevity but also for competitive advantage (Porter and Kramer, 2006; Crane and Matten, 2004). Thus, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is perceived as a unifying topic in management science and, by its societal dimension, in the economic and social sciences. Considered as an extension to the consideration of sustainable development in its managerial implications (Brundtland report, 1987), CSR has been at the attention of a large number of researchers for several decades now, in particular for twenty years in its social, environmental and normative dimension (ISO 14000) and since the 2000’s in its societal nature.While the concept of CSR is still under debate in its rather large literature, it should also be noted that this literature is usually silent on the construction mechanisms of CSR practices and even more on the role that stakeholders play in this construction.In this context, and relying on stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984; Oliver, 1991; Clarkson, 1995; Mitchell et al., 1997; Sethi, 1995; Rowley, 1997), the present analysis of the collected data from an eight-month-long in-depth investigation of six forestry firms in Cameroun yields several findings: First, the CSR model in Carroll (1979, 1991) is contingent to the context and the strategic CSR behaviour of the different firms in the forestry industry in Cameroun is strictly correlated to the nationality of these firms. Second, this study shows that the “field of action” variable has a non-significant effect on the strategic behaviour adopted by the firms in this forestry industry. Finally, this research also reveals that the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification represents the deposit of a voluntary commitment in terms of CSR of the forestry exploitation firms in Cameroun. The present work also opens new lines for future research focussing on the internalisation of the CSR practices by the contracting parties in strategic management of the firms that are in direct confrontation to the environmental challenges."
"The research project aims to observe and understand accounting choices made by French groups belonging to the SBF 120 index during the first time application of IAS/IFRS standards. To get a global point of view of the phenomenon we adopt a multi methods approach linking: constitution and analysis of a database, study of an econometric model, content analysis, survey and semi-structured interviews. Empirical data are studied with a conceptual framework combining positive accounting theory, conventional theory and sociological new-intuitionalism. We underline the homogeneity of retained accounting choices, and a will of minimizing effect of the normative change by maintaining previous methods. Also we identify explaining determinants for accounting choices made during the first application of IAS/IFRS standards. During uncertain period, lobby exerts by institutions and professionals are highly important for the choosing process. Considering of limited cognitive capacities and the care of legitimacy of choice, accountant adopt a mimetic behavior. "
"The Third Sector Structures have developed a form of Industrial Relations, linked to the Social Movement History; based on the evolution of different Cooperative groups; and adapted over the business cycle. This Relation System improves the well-being of individuals and Groups, it has evolved to suit social needs and to cover various risks. Abbé Pierre, founder of the Emmaus Movement has created a Structure providing supportive environment, social benefits and work for homeless people. This structure is similar to old forms of Charity and Cooperative structure, ""Communities"". It deals with old economic activities, those of ""Ragpickers"". Emmaüs Communities practice ""Flexicurity"" working policies. Indeed, they have staffs, volunteers, but also a third type of worker: the Companion. The Companion is both Social beneficiary and Worker in the structure that provides him Social benefits. Communities are both supportive and productive structures, dealing with Industrial and Welfare requirements. The comparison between France, Spain and the UK shows the evolution of Industrial Relations into the Communities, within different economical contexts. The Community’ Strategy evolves according to their positions on the Market. ""The far, a Community is from Emmaus Movement’s Ideology, the more it adopts market principles"". This flexibility determines the Career path of Companions. It conditions the Communities Welfare and Solidarity System."
"The competitiveness clusters (“pôles de compétitivité”), labeled in 2005 by the French government, aredesigned to support collaborative research and development (R&D) projects. Their originality is that theylead multiple organizations (companies, universities, research laboratories, etc.) geographically close toeach other to cooperate in order to generate innovations. Is geographical proximity a necessary condition forthe proper coordination of innovation activities in competitiveness clusters? This thesis aims to deepen theunderstanding of collaborative dynamics in R&D projects, in particular by focusing on non-spatial forms ofproximity (institutional, organizational, cognitive and social). Our field of inquiry is the competitiveness clusterSystematic Paris-Region over the period 2005-2015. We propose to analyze the territorial dynamics of thecluster, based on the study of the spatial evolution of cooperations, as well as the evolution of the positioningof organizations in collaborative R&D networks. These studies represent the construction and analysis ofmore than four million data. They involve the concepts and methods of networks theory, as well as principalcomponent analysis (PCA). In addition, 57 interviews with scientific and technical managers and 3 interviewswith employees of the competitiveness cluster enabled us to clarify the dynamics of proximity at work in thecollaborative projects of Systematic Paris-Region cluster."
"The attractiveness of the country is now an important component of economic policy; it is the center of political promotion, planning and development. With the globalization of the economy where cost reduction of transport and telecommunications annihilated distance, firms wishing to establish themselves abroad are upping the ante on their selection and choice of location , the country found in competition and make every effort not only to attract investment but also to retain them. And states become promoters of their own territories to attract multinational firms in the context of escalation as investment projects are limited and that the list of candidates to their home territories continues to grow. By the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union and negotiations for its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO ), Algeria aims to liberalize its economy and its roots in the international economy. Involved in the liberalization of foreign direct investment (FDI). The interest of Algeria in both managerial benefits, economic and social impact on its economy. To do this, Algeria has provided a number of texts and laws governing foundations of its investment policy that guarantees and advantages to investors.It is around the elements of the problem mentioned above that will focus our research in attempting to answer the following key questions : What determines the choice of multinational firms in the location of their investment, in other words what are the ex ante determinants of FDI ? What are the main instruments of economic and financial policy or the means used by governments to encourage and attract foreign investment ? What are the effects of these policies on FDI flows ?What about Algeria and its policy of promoting investment ? What are the effects of this policy, including the legal framework set up on FDI in Algeria? This device is sufficient to attract foreign investors?In its transition from a centralized to a market economy triggered the end of the 1988 economy , the Algerian government has imposed a policy of structural reforms that helped restore macroeconomic balances , liberalization economy, its modern infrastructure and staffing reduction of country risk . These reforms have increased FDI flows to Algeria. However, these results remain below the investment potential of the country: Algeria does not attract enough foreign firms compared to neighboring countries. Although Algeria has recorded positive results in certain sectors such as hydrocarbons , telecommunications, steel and pharmacy reforms introduced since the 90s have proved insufficient . And policy promotion and attraction of FDI led has not achieved the desired objectives. Similarly, revenues from hydrocarbon exports have failed to create a competitive industrial structure and allow for productive investment to play a more important role in the economy. Most of the private productive effort is directed toward the speculative economy at the expense of a productive economy . FDI that the opening of the Algerian economy and its great potential would attract, remain weak. However, the legal framework set up in Algeria provides some benefits and guarantees to foreign investors."
"This dissertation argues for a prospective turn in ergonomics to challenge the established fields of strategic design (SD) and management. Differences, similarities and relationships between strategic design and prospective ergonomics are being reviewed using existing theories and frameworks from design, ergonomics, strategic and innovation management. To complement the theoretical part, 12 cases have been analysed in greater depth according to 4 main dimensions of analysis. Outcomes have ishown that innovating through PE approach is about finding the right balance between on one hand meeting primary objectives, such as profit maximisation or solving the design problem, and on the other hand achieving social and human well-being, personal interest and ambitions, family relations, etc. Intervention of prospective ergonomics within a classical strategy perspective requires organizations to couple push-pull market strategies while considering the interest of different stakeholders throughout all stages of the development process. This means that prescriptive approaches, methods and tools in the positivist mode should be complemented with constructive modes of reasoning and designing as well as reflective methods and tools, while taking into consideration all levels and perspectives of value creation. From an educational perspective, the transfer of design knowledge and skills requires a mentorship and scholarship approach in research-, or practice-based learning, which implies a hermeneutic, reflective and participatory mode of design reasoning within a constructivist worldview"
"This thesis speaks about the creativity and conformity in serious gaming and the link with real work situations of executives. To explore this link, we conducted a training program using an army helicopter flight simulator that had been redesigned to train executives in teamwork. The study was conducted over two years in 16 game sessions with 44 volunteer participants from the same company. The research analyzed the gap between prescribed and real work. In English, contrary to French, there are two words for games: ""play"" and ""game"". Winnicott (1971) is inclined more towards spontaneously developed games (play), rather than on games organized and defined according to precise rules (game). He considers ""play"" to be a transitional space. This transitional space is a third area, a paradoxical space, because it is situated between the interior and exterior of the player. It is a space of development where creativity is dominant. Understanding what takes place in this intermediate space is essential to explore the relationship between serious gaming and real work: a space in which group dynamics can enhance or inhibit individual creativity. From observation and analyses of game sessions and associated interviews, we identified several instances of creativity during the game and afterwards at work, including: reorganization of the work, exchanging roles, negotiating the length of games, and virtual empowerment leading to real-world decision-making. Then, we analyzed what prevented the executives from entering this intermediate area and from ""play"" with the equipment: the ""pursuit of excellence"", the temporal pressure, the corporate culture, equipment limitations, self-consciousness, and competitiveness. Furthermore, most participants were concerned that their competence as managers was being evaluated and they self-evaluated their skills. Afterwards, we analyzed the contention that lack of deliberation before executing the game prescriptions. Our research demonstrates that suspension of reflection allows freeing itself from possible value conflicts and guilt when the prescriptions lead to performing ""dirty work"" (that is, to commit morally or ethically questionable acts). At a minimum, we observe that executives see themselves acting in situ and become aware of the impact of their transmitters' role in communication with the team. Executives use this experience to revitalize their thinking about professional practice, which thus becomes a tool to gain a different view of their managers’ role."
"This thesis emphasises five aspects of relations between South-South trade and « new » geography of international trade. We particularly pay attention to the links between BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) but also between China and SSA. The first part attempts to demonstrate some characteristics concerning the mutation of South-South trade relations. In the Chapter 1, the heterogeneity of BRICs is confirmed from some factors of bilateral trade flows with SSA. In the Chapter 2, the South-South trade flows play a significant role in the geographic diversification of intra-African trade in terms of new trading partners. In the Chapter 3, the assumption of a trade reorientation of ex-colonies since independence with China at the expense of former colonial powers has been empirically validated. The second part studies the linkages between the foreign economic policy and South-South trade. The findings of the Chapter 4 highlight the significant impact of the « One China policy » on Chinese and Taiwanese trade flows through the economic diplomacy. The estimates of the Chapter 5 confirm the heterogeneous average effects but also over time of the African trade agreements on trade according to the nature of trading partners, the kinds of trade agreements and their overlapping."
"Environmental and climate issues constitute a predominant and much up to date topic in international discussions. It is broadly recognized that developing countries are the most vulnerable when it comes to climate issues, albeit, they are the least responsible. Finding ways for households’ of these countries to cope with the harmful effects of climate goes through the necessity to identify mechanisms that can help, such as migration and remittances. The latter have been found in the scientific literature to be a hedge against several shocks such as natural disasters, conflicts, and economic shocks.This research thesis explores the theme of remittances, and climate variability in developing countries, by focusing on a sub-Saharan African country, Burkina Faso. Compared to its neighbouring countries, Burkina Faso has not been subject to much research in the migration and remittances. The country however has a vast migration history that is worth studying. Climate issues are also rampant, and very important, as the country is practising subsistence agriculture.   The findings of this dissertation show that remittances have a positive impact on households’ ability to cope with the negative effects of climate issues. Yet these important sources of inflows for developing countries might have some limitations. The first chapter assesses the impact of remittances and climate variability on the food security of households in Burkina Faso. We build a food security index using principal component analysis that encompasses the accessibility and utilization dimensions of the concept. We also compute an inter-annual rainfall index and the latter is found to have a negative impact on food security. After controlling for potential endogeneity issues using distance variables and migrant characteristics as instruments, remittances are found to enhance food security. Results are robust to alternative measures of food security and alternative calculations of rainfall variability.  In Chapter two, we assess the impact of remittances and natural disasters on poverty in Burkina Faso. To do so, we construct a poverty index using household’s housing characteristics and Multiple Correspondence Analysis method. Propensity score matching method is used as an empirical strategy, and results show that remittances have a negative impact on poverty. Another important result is that remittances have a higher impact on the resilience of households, when they have experienced disasters in the past.  Therefore, when it comes to natural disasters, these inflows act as an important tool for populations to be more resilient. Lastly in chapter 3, we assess the role of remittances and drought on diversification strategies of farm-households. This chapter uses the same database as chapter two, and also takes advantage of the climate database of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of University of Anglia . Results show that remittances by themselves are not sufficient to push households towards costly diversification strategies, and they need to be conditional to households’ wealth status to be effective. Climate conditions as well as soil properties have not surprisingly been found to significantly push households towards diversifying their income.This research sheds light on the undeniable importance of remittances in helping households to cope with harmful effects of climate, but also on its limitations. International and national policies that will contribute in a more efficient and less costly conveying of these inflows are to encourage. However in order for remittances to be efficient, reducing inequalities and poverty within populations is a necessity. Otherwise, they can contribute to dig further poverty gaps and extensively the vulnerably levels inside populations. Therefore, remittances should be seen as complementary to other sources of income, rather than substitute."
"The thesis deals with the impact of trade liberalization in a developing country : Tunisia. The issue is as follows : is agricultural liberalization contributing to economic growth in Tunisia or is liberalization having such detrimental consequences, in particular given the stabilisation measures concerning Tunisia, which makes it impossible ? The liberalization of agricultural trade does not exclusively encompass the elimination of tariff or quantitative barriers regulated by the International Agreements. The multitude of trade barriers makes it difficult to aggregate and tally them. For the purposes of this thesis, we have used year 1994 as the temporal benchmark to compare Tunisian trade before and after the signing of the Marrakech Agreement. The method to carry out a totally longitudinal analysis and to use a temporal benchmark was not previously used when dealing with agricultural liberalization in Tunisia. Our results show that liberalization is in general favourable to economic growth and to the Tunisian trade. However, trade and growth are only partially explained in this longitudinal analysis. As a consequence, liberalization has a limited impact on the Tunisian trade and on the GDP. This analysis of partial equilibrium is completed by a computable general equilibrium model, which contains no Cobb-Douglas function or CES-CET elasticity. Against all odds, it shows that agricultural liberalization is compatible with the wish to limit the budget deficit in Tunisia. Liberalization can even improve economic growth, but also entails the risk of reduction in wages."
"Since the end of the twentieth century, ecological claims have challenged the legitimacy of capitalism and led companies to justify and transform themselves. In particular, ecological criticism of capitalism lead to the rise of CSR in companies (Chiapello, 2013). In a constructivist approach to CSR, we question the scope of ecological criticism for organizational evolution. We aim at explaining how actors of a radical ecological criticism try to transform companies, threw the analysis of the ontological basis of this criticism, and the manner ecological claims are defended in an organizational context. This research is based on the framework of the Economies of worth (Boltanski & Thévenot, 1991), in order to take into account the multiplicity of social actor positions and their ability to argue and influence the evolution of companies. In particular, we analyze the emergence of an ecological argumentation and we question its radical character (Lafaye & Thévenot, 1993). This interpretative qualitative research is based on the study of two growing SMEs involved in Biodynamics. Through this multiple case study, we analyze the confrontation between the development of a functionalist organizational model and attempts to defend an ecological organizational model and CSR ambivalence in this tension. This research confirms and clarifies the ontological upheaval brought about by ecological argumentation (Lafaye & Thévenot, 1993). Then we specify what this upheaval implies for CSR and for the evolution of companies."
"At a time when economic growth is thought to be driven primarily by knowledge, the purpose of this research is to analyse to what extent two Small Island Developing States – Mauritius and Trinidad – are adequately equipped for this new economic context.  As former British colonies, they both joined the Commonwealth upon gaining independence in the nineteen-sixties and they have since largely succeeded in overcoming their initially unfavourable conditions.  Today, their good political, economic and social development is widely acknowledged.  The main focus of this research is to evaluate how far colonial legacy, which is still visible in the contemporary institutions of both these states, can favour the transition they wish to undertake towards knowledge-intensive activities as drivers of economic growth.  For this purpose, the research analyses the development trajectory followed by their institutions and their economy spanning the whole period of their colonial and post-independence history; additionally, this research considers the steps which are undertaken nowadays to build the framework required to foster a knowledge economy by studying more specifically the role of higher education as an essential tool for human capital formation.  While upholding that some of the assets which could help them achieve their objectives can be linked to their colonial past, the research contends that the transformation of these two countries into knowledge-based economies could be hindered by the legacy of colonisation on some of their current features and which, decades after gaining independence, impedes the widespread diffusion of knowledge amongst their population."
"This Ph-D studies the impact of migrants’ remittances on recipient economies using a macroeconomic approach. More specifically, it deals with the indirect effects of remittances on the economic growth of the migrants’ home countries on the basis of data from the Southern Mediterranean countries (SMC). This Ph-D will try to i) investigate the quantitative and qualitative effects of remittances, ii) identify the microeconomic and macroeconomic determinants of remittances, iii) investigate their effects on inequality, poverty and growth. Our results suggest that remittances are countercyclical in Algeria and Egypt, and procyclical in Morocco and Tunisia regarding the business cycle of the countries of origin. However, except for Algeria, remittances are procyclical regarding the business cycle of the migrants’ host country. Moreover, empirical findings show that altruism is the most important motivation behind remittances in SMC. Furthermore, our results indicate that remittances indirectly reduce inequality and poverty in the migrants’ home societies. This effect on poverty gains further importance when the recipient countries suffer from external chocks. Finally, this thesis shows that remittances can promote growth in countries with more efficient financial systems."
"The objective of this thesis is to analyze public debt management in order to show that, based on optimality criteria, public debt could be a more judicial financing choice in comparison with taxation or seigniorage. A comparative study between these three financing strategies is conducted by taking into consideration their respective institutional feasability and by revisiting the concept of optimality from a financial viewpoint, i.e. regarding the potential impacts on public finance soundness, and from an economic aspect, i.e. regarding the potential impacts on the economic performance of the country. The non optimality of taxation and seigniorage could be a motive for the Governement to finance public deficit by indebtedness. However, it must be highlighted that public debt must also comply with optimality criteria, otherwise it will be considered inefficient. Subsequently, it is shown that Government must aim at public debt sustainability in order to ensure its optimality. In other words, Governement must avoid public debt to follow an explosive path, which is likely to lead to its non optimality. Finally, the role of financial risks  in public debt management is put forth in order to suggest that non optimal or non sustainable public debt is partly due to failing financial risk management. The case study is conducted in the member countries of the Indian Ocean Commission."
"The objective of this PhD is to determine the main conditions under which attractive FDI policies of developing countries can impact their growth level. The theoretical framework belongs to the new endogenous growth models. The empirical framework is the case of Tunisia during the period 1970-2009. We consider a model of six simultaneous equations reflecting the growth of the Tunisian economy. First, this model assesses the impact of FDI on the growth process and permits us to establish the necessary conditions which ensure positive effects of spillovers.  Second, we define the determinants of FDI located in Tunisia.In particular, we exhibit the need for Tunisia to develop technological capabilities and human capital resources that affect the conditions to assimilate knowledge’s and technologies from outside. We also highlight the importance of some other factors including the business environment in the host country. These factors ensure that spillovers are efficient transmission channels in order to obtain sustained growth. The developing countries should therefore focus their efforts on improving the attraction of FDI policies and their absorption capacity with the view to create a more favourable environment for their development."
"Almost two decades after the liberalization of the Tunisian economy, regional disparities have been accentuated severely and are expected to grow further. The existing gap between the coastal regions and those inland is showing high inequality in terms of levels of income, growth, unemployment, productivity and poverty. The industry in the littoral regions remains the most competitive leading the Tunisian industry, while other regions in the interior lag behind with fewer strategic competences and skills and medium or even low performance. Hence, the process of regional convergence has been broken rather than achieved. 	The purpose of this research is to assess and quantify the macroeconomic and microeconomic impacts of seven economic policies which aiming to reduce regional disparities in Tunisia. For that purpose, we will use a micro-macro based approach with two interconnected models: A multiregional dynamic general-equilibrium model and a micro-simulation model. The implementation of these two models has enabled a projection exercise and simulation one. The first exercise studied the future evolution of the Tunisian economy in its national and regional dimensions without any economic and / or exogenous shock reforms. The results show that the littoral-internal cleavage is expected to increase if corrective measures will not be implemented. Simulation results show that trade liberalization policy benefits more to coastal regions. However, to stimulate growth performance on behalf of inland regions, positive discrimination action policies, as public and especially private investment increase, will be necessary. Moreover, reducing the economic gap performance between the coast and the interior can be done quickly through a major technological change for regions in the interior. All scenarios in this study reject the possibility of trade-off between growth and regional poverty and thus confirm the potential for pro-poor growth."
"Since 1979, China has undertaken the policies of  the Reforms and the Opening. This period  marks a turning-point of China. The liberalization of the market, the industrialization and the  internationalization, which are carried out in a systematic and gradual way, made it possible  to integrate China in the world economy and globalization. By studying the process of  globalization and regional development in China, we can observe a multiple evolution: a  transition from the traditional economy, planned and closed towards an economy modern and  opened market, a transformation of an agricultural society towards an industrial society and  services and a conceptual change of the Chinese centrism and tradition towards globalization  and modernity. This evolution is the result of the irresistible forces of the globalization and the experiments of China as for its refusal, its resistance, its acceptance forced, and its tests as regards training towards globalization. However, the growth of China is not shared in a  balanced way between the regions of China. Because of the differences in natural  environment, in the resources, the industrial structures, social development and taking into account the historical and political elements, the development of the delayed areas of China is a question which concerns not only the economic stability and policy of China, but also of a source of durability of the Chinese growth. The FDI is one of the factors contributing to the  economic growth in China, but they are not the only faulty factors for the disparity in China."
"This thesis has a dual purpose. First, it presents the methods used to build two new historical databases relating to departments. The first database provides the departmental lifetables for the period 1901-20-14. The second database provides the departmental distributions of income over the period 1960-2014. Second, this thesis presents the first work resulting from the joint use of these two databases and other statistics: they concern both the dynamics of spatial inequalities and some specific historical events. Thus, the analysis of the spatial distribution of the population since the middle of the 19th century allows to understand the dynamics induced by the rural exodus, but also by the new trends of today's migrations. The analysis of mortality inequalities over the last 200 years shows that inequalities have fallen dramatically since the end of the 19th century, while the geography of excess mortality has changed. Finally, the analysis of spatial income inequalities reveals a continuous decline since the 1920s. This decline occurred only since 1950 spatial inequalities are observed using a synthetic indicator of welfare, combining both mortality inequalities and income inequalities. The thesis ends with the analysis of internal migrations during the Second World War: these migrations were massive, and clearly oriented towards the free zone. These results testify both to the impact of this event on French demography, and to the quest for freedom of the French of that time, little hampered by the demarcation line."
"The aim of this thesis is to analyze the evolution of poverty and identify the socio-economical groups as well as the dimensions that contribute to it in Tunisia following a monetary approach and also a multi-dimensional one. For this reason, I adopt a method which consists in using the approach of stochastic dominance and the theory of fuzzy sets. That is to say, I adopt some of the different methods which have been adopted in the previous studies that were interested in Tunisia. Three main conclusions emerge from the exploitation of data based on two national surveys of the budget and the consumption of households 2005, 2010 and another national survey of the family health 2006. In fact, the first one reveals the decrease of poverty at the national level despite that there are disparities that still persist between rural and urban areas and between the coastal regions and the regions of the interior as well. The second survey puts in evidence that the effects of redistributive policies in Tunisia have not accelerated the pace of poverty reduction. As for the third survey, it suggests that taking into account the multi-dimensional aspect of poverty reveals the existence of other important dimensions in relationship with poverty that constitute an obstacle to a decent life for the Tunisian households."
"This thesis aims to study the effects of public debt on the Economic Growth in the presence of Non Linearity. Thestudy is applied to the member countries of the Economic and Monetary Union of West Africa. A theoretical study ofthe characteristics and evolution of macroeconomic aggregates is made in the first chapter. In Chapter 2, the studyof the non-linearity between Public Debt and Economic Growth concluded in the existence of an optimal debt level ofabout 80%. This threshold is achieved through the methodology of brutal transaction and smooth transaction but also amethodology of estimation of dynamic panel. Subsequently, a study of solvency and sustainability is made. This chapterhas allowed a thorough study of the stationarity of the debt and cointegration series of revenue and expenses. Thepurpose of this chapter is to study the WAEMU countries repayment capacity. Finally, the link between the structure ofpublic expenditure and Economic Growth is studied in the last chapter. An error correction model was used to study theimpact of the composition of public expenditures on Economic Growth."
"We endeavour to explore the many ways by which international trade has an impact on sustainability.From a theoretical perspective, sustainability is the application of the utilitarian theory of value on capitaltheory, used to define the interactions between human-being and their environment. We show how sustainabilitycan be understood as sound and equitable management of the means of development, preserving consumptionand wealth over time while fostering intragenerational and intergenerational equity and controlling for moneyvaluesubstitutability. We use Adjusted Net Savings (ANS) to assess how opening economies to trade altersdevelopment paths. We then show how international trade should lead to additional savings, as gains fromtrade resulting from resources reallocation should be reinvested and not consumed. We explore how the natureof trade impacts development paths, showing how increasing returns to scale in the international division of theproduction processes changes factor prices. This should lead to more gains from trade saved and reinvested.We investigate how institutions and trade incentives interact in hindering sustainable management of naturalcapital in resource abundant countries. We show how inter-industry trade in natural resources intensive goodsmight be a sign for unsustainable development paths. To better understand interactions between institutionsand sustainability, we suggest the dislocation of the Soviet Union as a natural experiment. We show how theevolution of ANS in the Russian Federation is closely correlated with the neighbouring countries, regardless ofresources abundance. Counterfactual studies should be used to monitor sustainable development in the wakeof uncertainty and scarce data on comprehensive wealth depreciation. Those elements lead us to conclude onthe necessity to reconsider the rationale for economic integration on sustainability lines."
"It is recognized in economic theory that the existence of significant risks can cause serious disruption to the well-being of households and to the State budget’s balance, because the risks do not often value for money. Assuming that the risk is a hazard and vulnerability occurs, we find that the hazard is often seen in Niger as the only ""guilty"" of these disturbances, while the agents' behavior towards risk can be a factor. On this observation, this thesis proposes to analyze these behaviors and their implications in the economic decisions of households. The main results first show a rather relative risk aversion, which can be explained by two main approaches: a fatalistic perception of natural and man-made hazards on the one hand, and adaptive rationality in terms of the importance of these risks and the vulnerability of households, on the other. This notion of aversion was then used to provide a link to the analysis of risk behavior associated with information asymmetry. It is clear from this analysis, to natural hazards which individuals appear powerless; they are developing opportunistic behavior at the expense of credit agreements mutually beneficial, by abuse of informational rent. We believe that in this case, the incentive constraint must be taken seriously. The simultaneity of climate risk and high information asymmetry rural index suggests that the agricultural insurance should be progressively considered."
"By seeking to identify the centralities of a territory, one has to take into account the ongoing evolution of the spatial structuration. The strong employment increase, together with the slowdown of people working in the town they live (i.e. “stables”), triggers a transition in the centrality-mobility relation. The new urban organisation modes result from the spatial distribution of employment concentration as well as the intensification of commuting. These two variables will be retained in order to characterise the Gironde’s communes, through a new nomenclature called Areas of Multi-commune Cohesion (AMC). Planning issues that ensued from the AMCs lead to a prospective approach structured by Transport/Urbanism co-development. Indeed, urbanisation scenarii are subject to uncontrolled and autonomous development. By anticipating transport planning strategies, decision makers can limit the uncertainty related to the real urbanisation consequences. The main issue lies in defining the conditions of a multipolar development of Gironde county. This would enable to support the territorial integration process, while loosening land constraints around Bordeaux agglomeration."
"Since the Clean Air Act Amendment (1990), the markets of tradable emissionpermits are becoming increasingly attractive. Very few works on the functioning of thesemarkets have analyzed the participation of citizens in order to buy and retire emissionspermits. This dissertation aims to study the effects of allowing citizens to participate inmarkets of tradable emission permits. In the first chapter, we show that when the pollutioncap is strictly greater than the optimal one, citizen’s participation is socially beneficial andnever socially harmful, even in the presence of free-riding. In the second chapter, based onoperating pollution markets in the US and Europe, we highlight the emergence of a demandto purchase and cancel emissions permits. In the third chapter, we show how it is possible topartly solve the free rider problem by subsidizing the citizen’s demand. Moreover, we arguethat an ethics based on the freedom and the sovereignty of citizens commands to allowcitizens participation in pollution market. In the fourth chapter, we focus on citizen’sparticipation in pollution markets with a regional pollution model. Such an implicationdepends on the value of transfer coefficients."
"Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey in 2002 brings a new dimension to the issue of financing for development, which is available across a broad funding approach integrating key areas: mobilizing domestic financial resources and other inputs external capital (direct investment, official development assistance, debt relief, remittances from migrants) and finally, review the international monetary and financial system. The aim of this thesis is to analyze this funding approach based on the concept of financial liberalization. The aim is firstly to highlight the role of finance in economic development through the study of causality between finance and economic development. Next, we revisit the financial liberalization policies by emphasizing the study of their impact through the analysis of internal and external resources for financing development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The analysis will focus on mobilizing domestic resources through the tax system and the mobilization of external resources through the liberalization of the domestic financial system. Finally, under the condition of combined financial underdevelopment in the economic underdevelopment of these countries, we show the need for a different approach to financing that is more comprehensive. This alternative policy through political from economic heterodoxy integrating elements of historical institutionalism and post-Keynesian theory."
"In a global economic context where the WTO is losing momentum, nations experiment all sorts of agreements which are likely to help them implement their international integration strategies: bilateral, strategic, regional, cooperation, association agreements, etc. It results in a competition between the United States and the European Union to win the most important market in Latin America, Mercosur, which now enjoys a favourable context and can choose its partners. Since the Free TradeArea of the Americas project was rejected, the game of seduction benefits Europe for it has offered a more complete project including cooperation for development, a deeper political dialogue and a free trade area. Furthermore,the negotiations opened in 1999 with a view to getting to a so-called “association” agreement between the two regional integration systems, symbolise the emergence of a new concept: “interregionalism”Why were those 12 years of negotiation notsufficient to reach a consensus on the terms ofthe association?The complexity of the files, the number ofcountries involved, the agricultural issue andthe lack of consulting from the private sectorare all clues to be taken into consideration.The interest of this research lies in theperspective given by political and economicstakeholders from the two regions. Meetingthem and analysing their speeches helped meshow that the private sector has not beendirectly consulted at all during thenegotiations. In addition, the economicstakeholders have expressed their will to bepart of the process. The private sector alsocalled out the Universities, reminding the rolethey can play in the evolution of therelationship between the two regions."
"This thesis studies the role of essential patents for the coordination of innovation in ICT standards. The increasing number of essential patents around technological standards is an increasing challenge for standardizing firms. In response, these firms have developed innovative coordination mechanisms, and in particular patent pools and informal standards consortia. This thesis sheds light on the function of essential patents as a distinctive appropriation mechanism tailored to cumulative innovation. This mechanism can however induce incentives for opportunistic strategies, which can be even exacerbated by patent pools. Nevertheless, patent pools also lead to an increase in the number of patented technologies developed for technological standards. Informal consortia induce an increase in the number of standard-related patents when incentives to innovate are insufficient. When the incentives to innovate are excessive, the effect of consortia on the number of patents is weaker, or even negative. Essential patents have an incidence on the technological progress of standards. For instance, inclusion of essential patents induces a more continuous type of technological progress, consisting in many small standard updates, and avoiding discontinuous standard replacements."
"The central purpose of this thesis is the development of fresh fishery products with on one hand the issue of organizational methods adopted by stakeholders in the fisheries sector in France and on the other hand the question of explanatory factors in consumer preferences for these products. The neo-institutional theory of governance structures is used to analyze different organizational methods adopted in the industry. The theory of innovation is mobilized to study the contribution of organizational innovations in the development of fresh products. The results of the study of governance structures reveal the complementarity between the market and hybrid forms concerning the supply of supermarkets and hypermarkets in France. Mainly observed Hybrid forms are subcontracting and partnership. The results on organizational innovations highlight in particular various forms of responses from stakeholders on quality, freshness, traceability and product availability. Finally, this thesis has implemented the method of multi-attribute choice to analyze consumer preferences for two products, fresh fish fillet and fresh lobster. Through various logistic models, the results highlighted the existence of three categories of consumers. They also confirmed a willingness to pay for attributes of freshness, quality and certain environment related attributes. The originality of the thesis is to have included among product’s characteristics include the carbon footprint attribute. It thus helps to clarify the debate on relevant sustainability criteria to include in the common reference for labeling of sea fishing products in France."
"Our thesis focuses on the consumption of organic products, and more particularly, in the dentification of the variables that influence purchase intention. lf numerous studies dealt with this subject, there are nevertheless shadow zones which we give as objective to clear up. First of all, it seems that there are notable differences in term of motivation of purchase of organic products according to the degree of maturity of the market. Then, the rational frame of the theory of planned behavior, often used in previous researches, was criticized many a time. lndeed, the absence of consideration of variables such as emotions and desire reduces its predictive power. We thus choose as theoretical framework of our study the model of goal directed model (Bagozzi and Perugini, 2001, 2004) to study organic products purchase intention in Lebanon, a developing market. The obtained results confirm a distinction of motivations of purchase between developed and developing markets. Besides, the results prove the role of desire and emotions in the purchase intention of organic products. Other variables specific to our context of studies are identified and their role proven: the health Locus of Control and the perceived authenticity of organic products."
"The scope and magnitude of changes occurring in business today has led to great interest in and widespread adoption of Quality and Environmental Management approaches. However, despite their prevalence, efforts at understanding the motives for their adoption, as well as their effects on firm and employee outcomes, are still in their infancy. This PhD dissertation provides useful theoretical and empirical contributions to three research topics dealing with Quality and Environmental Management approaches in the French institutional framework: (1) the determinants of their adoption, (2) their impact on firm outcomes and (3) their impact on employee outcomes. These three aspects make up the three parts of this PhD thesis.In part I, we define and characterise quality and environmental approaches with a special focus on ISO 9000 Quality Management standards and ISO 14000 Environmental Management standards. Furthermore, we empirically examine the determinants of quality and environmental standards adoption. Our findings reveal that the determinants of quality standards significantly differ between manufacturing and service firms, particularly when we examine features of the internal strategy of those firms (quality improvement, cost reduction and innovation). However, we have also obtained evidence which indicates that the characteristics of firms (firm size, corporate status and previous experience with similar standards) and features of their external strategy (export levels and customer satisfaction) play a significant role in quality standards adoption across both the manufacturing and service sectors. Moreover, we empirically investigate the determinants of chemical firms' registration for the ISO 14001 standard or the Responsible Care program. We show that most determinants are different for the two systems analysed: while firm size, previous experience with similar standards, information disclosure requirements and customer location are major determinants of ISO 14001 standard registration, regulatory pressure, past environmental problems and future risks are the main drivers of Responsible Care registration.In part II, we empirically investigate whether quality and environmental standards are related to better firm performance using various sets of performance measures. The evidence indicates that quality standards positively influence turnover and specific indicators of innovation performance and productivity, but have no impact on profit and some other innovation performance measures. Based on our empirical findings, we conclude that while environmental standards improve turnover and recruitment of both professional and non professional employees, they have no effect on profit. Moreover, the research shows that implementing both quality and environmental standards is likely to better enhance firm outcomes than implementing only one standard.Part III is focused on the effect of quality and environmental standards on employee outcomes. The estimation results show that quality standards increase the risk of employee accidents although more specifically they are ineffective on working accidents that lead to sick leave. On the other hand, our results lead to the conclusion that environmental standards add significantly to the enhancement of working conditions, via the reduction of accidents. Furthermore, the obtained evidence shows that environmental standards seem to improve employee well-being. More precisely, employees working for firms that are certified for an environmental standard report greater feelings of usefulness about their job and declare that they are more often fairly valued in their jobs. The evidence also shows that employees working for environmentally certified firms do not claim to be significantly more involved in their job but they are more likely, ceteris paribus, to work uncompensated for sup plementary work hours than “non green workers”."
"Environmental innovation or eco-innovation is considered one of the most significant paradigm shifts in the innovation behaviour. The specificity of eco innovation lies in the fact that environmental improvement, in addition to technological advancement, is the main reason of its development. By combining these two objectives, eco-innovation has become one of primary tools in the search to solve the world’s environmental problems and sustainability challenges. Despite its prevalence, there is still more to be discovered within the eco-innovation literature. The drivers of and barriers to eco-innovation discussion is one of the most significant amongst all. More notably, the role of a firm’s social, technological, economic and organizational characteristics within the eco-innovation process has been little studied. With this Ph.D. thesis we aim to fill the existing gap with four distinct research articles. [...] Chapter 2 investigates, firstly, whether firms’ internal characteristics have an impact on the adoption of voluntary environmental standards. Secondly, the causal effect of adoption of environmental standards on the firms performance. Based on the empirical evidence obtained, we show that medium-size, high-tech manufacturing firms operating at the EU level and using quality standards are more likely to adopt these standards earlier. [...] In Chapter 3, we stressed the significance of a firm’s structural characteristics in another context and aimed at investigating the role these characteristics play in realization of product and/or process eco-innovation. [...] In Chapter 4 we moved forward the analyses conducted in Chapter 3 to another context and examined the influence of firm’s economic, technological, organisational capabilities on the eco-innovation behaviour for different types of product, process, organisational or marketing eco-innovators. The results of our empirical analyses point out the marginal impacts of firm’s characteristics changes with respect to type of eco-innovator. [...]"
"Both divisions and concentrations of population characterize contemporary metropolitan areas. Known as segregation processes, these dynamics are usually studied through the analysis of residential locations. Our thesis, however, proposes another lens to uncover urban change. It focuses on daily mobility that shape urban spaces and individual ways of life. This leads us to organize the reflexion from residential segregations to daily urban spaces segregation (from immobile to mobile segregation). Furthermore, we put the individual, and not the household, at the heart of segregative dynamics. Four contemporary metropolitan areas are considered, in a comparative framework. These examples were analyzed through the same specific methodology, based on transport households surveys data. The study highlights the economic understanding of proximity individual behaviors (immobility and local life) and of attraction areas accesses. Proximity, once a measure for sustainable urban policies, indeed becomes a reality for poor citizens. Spatial isolation nowadays relates to individual characteristics rather than residential locations. Some specificities are added further to these strong tendencies. Different social and spatial dynamics clearly appear in Southern and Northern cities and effects of urban forms inherited from History are asserted (especially in Niamey). Our work finally complete the usual perspective of urban segregation in several contrasted urban contexts."

"Internal Audit is an independent and objective activity that contributes to the control of companies and to create added value. For this purpose, the internal auditor shall ensure: consistency, ambition and the feasibility of the objectives, of the optimization of the means used for their infringement, compliance with policies; procedures, statutory instruments, compliance with the delegation of authority and finally ensures the protection of the heritage. Internal audit detects problems; identify their causes, and makes recommendations to solve them. In Morocco, several pieces of legislation have planned the establishment of the internal audit within the Moroccan organizations. However, despite this, the internal audit does not play effectively its role: why and how?"
"This dissertation focuses on the search for the possible normative foundations of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This is an in-depth analysis of the notion of a standard, its function as a management tool, and its limits outside any ethics.The subject is treated in a transdisciplinary manner : the theoretical contribution of management sciences is based on the empirical study of law revealing utopias, feasible or not, under CSR. Are these so-called ethical responsibilities, a new ideology, a kind of social dream which cares little for the actual steps in the construction of a new society? or are they a new power okknowledge, a project of political organization, based on the axiology of human rights? The study of the place of law in the CSR is a way to revisit many theories of organizations, including on governance, stakeholders, democracy, sustainable development, risk and responsibility. This study concludes with the need for prior compliance with the law, in the creation of the standard and use of management tools. The object of the research is at the crossroads between management and legal sciences. Nevertheless, it allows a critical reflection on the flexibility of the rule of law and regulation by standards which have become more and more soft and fuzzy, causing the privatization of the global economic system. Taking the measure of the normative changes in global governance, this dissertation proposes to overcome the challenge of conflicts of norms, by introducing a new ethic of responsibility. In France, the idea would be to design the corporate social responsibility like the legal fiction of corporate citizenship. A true extension of preventive responsibility would be born by the legal entities under their sphere of influence."
"Focusing on CEO resilience, this dissertation contributes to the upper echelons or strategic leadership research tradition and highlights a capacity, which is crucial in times of uncertainty, rapid change and pressure. Adopting a three essay format (two empirical and one theoretical pieces), it questions the influence of CEO resilience. The first chapter contextualises my work by reviewing previous ""upper echelons"" contributions pertaining to CEO characteristics and resilience literature. The first essay then investigates the impact of CEO resilience on firm performance and demonstrates the existence of a bell shape curvilinear relationship, relationship moderated by financial slack and industry complexity. 	The second essay confirms the existence of a U shape curvilinear relationship between CEO resilience and strategic dynamism and establishes the mediating role of strategic dynamism in the CEO resilience-company performance sequence. The third essay, which is conceptual, provides a model for internal and external diffusion of CEO resilience in times of crisis. Finally the concluding chapter of my thesis stresses some limitations, proposes future research avenues, and put forward some managerial implications."
"Economic activities have forms and degrees of dependency variables to the environment. The environment can act as a factor of production as a constraint to the use of certain inputs, such as a constraint for some inputs. Dependence may be related to the availability or quality of certain environmental resources. It will explore the implications of different forms of dependencies bio-physico-chemical as well as legal. In the case of the Arcachon Bay oyster-farming will examine the forms of dependence and economic measure, through the economic impacts associated with the variable availability of living marine resources but also to the natural productivity of the environment. The analysis of socio-economic characteristics of Arcachon Bay oyster-farms will develop a typology of the latter and thus characterize the activity. A production function approach will be used to highlight the varying degrees of sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions of production while the evaluation by the hedonic price method will determine the implicit price of environmental components of the oyster leases value taking into account also the geographical location of oyster leases."
"For nearly two centuries, generations of clockmakers from Besançon have transmitted their values,knowledges and passion for this job that has deeply rooted into Besançon territory. In the 70's, thenew ""quartz"" technic questioned the traditional clock-making and the traditional watchmakingdisappeared. Then come the turn of an activity based on microtechnics, wich is seen as the legacy ofclock-making knowledge. What is the true nature of this legacy ? Throughout our Phd, we fried toanswer this question, analysing how the watchmaking industry evolved to microtechnics. We triedto anderstand how the professional categories, that used to be united around a common project andunited by a higly cohesive culture, set apart in a crisis time. The jobs wich were initially occupedcreated little by little some specific identities, hidden however by the global culture. In this periodof relative instability caused by environnemental changes, these identities assert and the normes,representations and values of each group create different logics. The group wich is abble to drowfrom it's own resources to adapt itself to the environnemental changes gets the power that otherslose when they refuse these changes. Thus, the orientation of this activity to the microtecnics sectorcan be conceived as a stratégy wich would help the knowledge of one of the present categoriesperpetuate. Rhater than a simple adjusting phenomenon to new economical and technical contraints,this change can therefore be also analysed as a microsocial phenomenon resulting from logics andfights to master the future of this territorialized industrie"
"Can we, today, address the citizens' healthcare without talking about his territory ? This seems unbelievable, and the French government has already understood this and to answer to this question has designed and launched the ""ARS"", which stand for ""Healthcare Regional Agency"", in order to define and manage healthcare strategy at its own territory level (region). But, before arriving to this conclusion, the healthcare system had to reform itself along four centuries moving from healthcare concept to healthcare system concept. This has been conducted through several reforms from decision makers that had to use quantifiable elements to perform so. Therefore, some specific indicators, called ""health deterministic indicators"", have been put in place. Then, the sum of all these along the years bring the French government to launch the ARS which are defined within the law called ""HPST"" standing for Hospital Patient Healthcare and Territory). Now, if we are looking closer to the ARS mission, it clearly appears that they are closely linked to the notion of ""sustainable performance"" for which it is important to define underneath concepts as ""Performance"", ""sustainable performance"" and of course ""healthcare sustainable performance"". Then, to applied those healthcare sustainable performance principles, the ARS would have to learn how this performance could be increased or decreased based on some specific mechanisms. Therefore, the notions of ""risk"" and ""vulnerability"" became key components of such an approach. However, looking forward it appears that the vulnerability has a close link to risk and that the risk is essentially linked to a mismatch between the ""offering"" and the ""demand"" or the ""needs"" of the citizens. Then, by integrating all those aspects, the ARS would became a healthcare sustainable performance for a territory vector, thanks to new governances, a better risk management politic and the usage of performance measures as healthcare expenses for a territory, regulation tool. Based on this it is easy to understand that the ARS will be at the heart of the reform and will have to drive the regional health system. But, and it is true for all sectors (private and public), the management of such a system cannot be done without an accurate information system. Then, the next question is ""what is an information system for a health system?"" but also, ""how to feed this information system in order to let it provide relevant information?"" Therefore, to understand this, it is necessary to understand the definition of all existing information system types and their role in the healthcare environment and how the citizen and the patient will take benefits of that. Based on this theory, it is now interesting to better understand the status of the current health information system and why he has failed in his pupil service missions, and that in order to better understand how, through a new ARS governance, it will be possible to have health information system able to reach the sustainable performance goals. The failure notification and the willingness to get the French healthcare system out of this trap is real. However, it is important to notice that to succeed in the mission regarding the information system, it will be necessary to adopt an accurate methodology. But, it is also important to understand that after investigation, no such methodology has been found and it appears necessary to build one in order to satisfy the needs of health professionals, citizens, patients. The final goal being to allows the French health system to reach the health sustainable performance goals by the understanding and the resolution of business pains coming from the citizen requests known and understood at the right time and the right location. It is easy to understand that cannot be done without a better understanding of the human, geographical, politic, social and health environment that could be better handled through new technologies. Therefore, it will be possible to put in place certain of these technologies that will enable this approach by allowing a global access to data or simplifying application integration into complex business processes or providing analysis and permanent traceability tools allowing to take ""preventive"" decisions (real time) or ""corrective"" decisions (after past facts analysis). Everything, of course, being at maximum secured and with maximum integrity guarantee. This thought has bring to the definition of MAEVA methodology which seat in the middle of a particular context composed by actors (health professionals, citizens, politicians, patients, etc. ), stimulus (known or unknown meaning handled or not), the health system itself (on which the methodology is applied) and results (benefits for the health system increasing the sustainable performance of the health system). To do so, I has been necessary to build the method in two ""layers"". The first layer is made of components called ""fundamentals"" which permit to define the project foundations that has to be implemented by following MAEVA rules. These fundamentals, counted as four (plus one) allow the definition of a global consensus for the project and for the associated community of practice in order to successfully deliver the related project. The ""fifth"" fundamental allows the rationale to pursue on a new version or to stop the project in its current stage if the necessary condition to continue it are not met. Once these basis have been setup, the method offer the capability to define five actions which will allow to manage the project from the beginning until the final delivery. These actions are: ""Integration"", allowing the integration of the data sources needed to the project implementation; ""Detection"", allowing the definition of ""actuators"" components bringing to a risky situation ; ""Anticipation"", allowing the definition of self defense mechanisms against the previously mentioned ""actuators""; ""Action"", allowing the realization of the project mission; and at the end, ""Evaluation"", offering factual elements to analyze project outcomes and provide therefore facts to the fundamental ""Decide"". All these components are linked within the methodology through two ""tools"": Iteration, allowing to complete a phases with results coming from an upfront phase; and the Active Memory Zone (ZAM) which is used to be the project memory in order to store traceability data, but also ""keep in mind"" all taken decisions. This methodology, as defined, hasn't been designed theoretically in few months, but has been the result of real life projects analyze done during the past five years in the area of health system performance. It is also good to know that the MAEVA approach based on consensus will be a great help for the ARS, as they will have, since the beginning, work with people, processes and information coming from diverse horizons that were, until now, more in competition rather than in collaboration mood. But all of this is just about the first version of the methodology and already, due to read publications, it appears that some research works, like ""Design Thinking"" should be integrated partially or totally in a future ""release"" of MAEVA.

"The main focus of this thesis is the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) in hospitals, and more particularly the difficulties of use after the implementation phase. Our approach aimed to design, with the academic knowledge of Information Systems, a method allowing field actors to act on this specific issue. In concrete terms, we were looking for ways to improve ""misfit"" situations, i.e. situations in which health professionals consider the use of EPR to be unsuitable for their profession. To do this, we sought to understand the mixed record of EPR use reported in the professional literature, by using the dual nature (enabling or coercive) of technology-induced work formalization (Adler & Borys, 1996). Enabling technology allows a user to be positioned as a source of solutions, while coercive technology tends to consider them as a source of problems. In the first manuscript on the autonomy of health professionals in relation to the hospital information system, we concluded that an enabling formalization is needed to improve the use of EPR. In the second manuscript, we showed that in the examples of negative experiences of the EPR reported in the literature, it was possible to highlight the different aspects of coercive formalization. To argue on the dual nature of the formalization of work induced by EPR, we have reported in the third manuscript an illustrative empirical study. Our data show that for the same EPR, in the same hospital, there may be islets of enabling formalization.Moving beyond the health field of application alone, we have further developed Strong & Volkoff's 2010 conceptualization of the misfit between business process and Enterprise System (ES), using the concepts of affordance and affordance-actualization used by the same authors in 2013 and 2014.The fourth manuscript therefore presents an original model for analyzing the use of information technology for a given business process in the form of a combination of actualizations, non-actualizations or partial actualizations of multiple affordances of the enterprise system by multiple actors. From a critical realistic perspective, misfit is then the perception by an individual or group of individuals that this combination does not satisfactorily meet all or some of the objectives of the process.We then report on how we used this model to improve the use of EPR in post-implementation in an action research project. The analysis of a misfit situation according to our method allows a recombination, by seeking a coherent sequence of technical and organizational adjustments acceptable to all stakeholders and whose arrangement allows the disappearance of the initial misfit, but also of all the misfits revealed during the analysis. This recombination then leads to a formalization of the work that has all the characteristics of an enabling formalization.The discussion of the thesis addresses the conditions for the success of the method, the choice of situations on which to apply it and the resulting research perspectives."
"The main focus of this thesis is the Electronic Patient Record (EPR) in hospitals, and more particularly the difficulties of use after the implementation phase. Our approach aimed to design, with the academic knowledge of Information Systems, a method allowing field actors to act on this specific issue. In concrete terms, we were looking for ways to improve ""misfit"" situations, i.e. situations in which health professionals consider the use of EPR to be unsuitable for their profession. To do this, we sought to understand the mixed record of EPR use reported in the professional literature, by using the dual nature (enabling or coercive) of technology-induced work formalization (Adler & Borys, 1996). Enabling technology allows a user to be positioned as a source of solutions, while coercive technology tends to consider them as a source of problems. In the first manuscript on the autonomy of health professionals in relation to the hospital information system, we concluded that an enabling formalization is needed to improve the use of EPR. In the second manuscript, we showed that in the examples of negative experiences of the EPR reported in the literature, it was possible to highlight the different aspects of coercive formalization. To argue on the dual nature of the formalization of work induced by EPR, we have reported in the third manuscript an illustrative empirical study. Our data show that for the same EPR, in the same hospital, there may be islets of enabling formalization.Moving beyond the health field of application alone, we have further developed Strong & Volkoff's 2010 conceptualization of the misfit between business process and Enterprise System (ES), using the concepts of affordance and affordance-actualization used by the same authors in 2013 and 2014.The fourth manuscript therefore presents an original model for analyzing the use of information technology for a given business process in the form of a combination of actualizations, non-actualizations or partial actualizations of multiple affordances of the enterprise system by multiple actors.

"This thesis focuses on a first economic assessment of prematurity in France. Prematurity is defined as occurring before 37 weeks of gestation. It is increasing in France and worldwide. If the issues of public health are already well identified, medical care and collective choices concerning prematurity matters also involve significant economic challenges. The first part of this thesis attempts to present the public health issues of prematurity and highlights the remaining efforts required to provide prevention in France. It then considers economic issues on the use of socially fairer resources dedicated to perinatal health in a context where current health expenditure is rising. Assessment of the collective burden of care for preterm infants is necessary and envisaged by a Cost-Of-Illness study. Finally it presents a framework where ethical and economic considerations are complementary. The second part addresses the methodology and results of the study. The study assesses the hospital and non-hospital direct costs for preterm and term births, in the first year of life, from health insurance point of view. It is based on an extraction of data from the National Heal Insurance Inter-Regime Information System. The results of the study highlight in particular the level of average costs associated with extreme prematurity (before 32 weeks) and demonstrate an inverse and significant relationship between average costs and the gestational age (GA) at birth. This economic study invites awareness of the policy makers about the need to provide financial and human resources to anticipate and prevent critical situations associated with prematurity."

"Empirical studies on the social cost of payments all agree to recognize that coins and bills are the most costly payment instruments for society. In recent years, commercial and central banks implemented various strategies to reduce the holdings and the use of cash. Of these, non-pricing strategies such as the improvement of the currency system or the change of the manufacturing technology have been implemented. However, their actual effectiveness is an issue of discussion. This PhD deals with these non-pricing strategies, namely the optimal denominations for coins and banknotes, the cost efficiency of currency systems and payment instruments. The aim is to better understand the implications of the payment behavior, the manufacturing technology and the structure of the monetary denomination system (MDS) on the distribution of cash transactions in the economy and their social cost. First, we analyze the consequences of relaxing some restrictive assumptions of theoretical studies that compare the efficiency of MDS based on a French empirical distribution of cash transactions obtained from a nationally representative household survey. Next, we challenge the widespread belief that an efficient MDS reduces the social cost of cash by differentiating the variable costs of production of currency and fixed costs per denomination. We show that efficient payment solutions in terms of the principle of least effort may be more costly for the central bank, propose an original framework to measure the profitability of the adoption of a new manufacturing technology of currency and finally, parameterize and simulate a search model of money to compare the social cost of multiple MDS.

"This research is focused on the explanation of the determination of firm performance. It is based upon the theoretical framework called the + resource based stream ;. This stream of research contains two approaches : the resource based theory and the evolutionary economics. This work presents the first empirical study of the resource-based stream, applied at the level of the french manufacturing industries. We used the bank of france database called sesame. The main sample hase 2875 firms. The statistical model used is lisrel. Moreover, an original simulation model was developed, based on the object languages, in order to test the influences of temporal determinism on the firms resources endowment. The empirical results show that both the non-imitability and the non- transferability of the productive resources sustain the firm performance. Moreover, the exchange relationships, with suppliers and customers, when non- transferable enable the firm to appropriate idiosyncrasic rents. The internal coordination, within the firm, reinfoces the resources properties that lead to performance. "

"This ph. D. Thesis in economics balances discounting, technical progress and the inertia of existing capital stock against uncertainty and the inertia of socio-economic systems to examine the issue of near term limitations of greenhouse gases emissions. After a general overview in chapter 2, and an more historical presentation of the debates in chapter 3, chapter 4 proceeds to reviewing a large number of integrated assessment models. Chapter 5 introduces a model on the dynamics of inertia and adaptability of energy systems : diam, used to discuss how much previous studies overestimated the long term costs of co@ limitations and underestimated adjustment costs. It shows the optimality of atmospheric co@ concentration stabilisation, even under relatively mild assumptions for climate damages. In a sequential decision framework, chapter 6 shows that current uncertainties about which co@ concentration ceiling would not present dangerous interference with the climate system justifies precautionary action. Finally, chapter 7 uses the irreversibility effect theory to define, formally situations of 'decision under controversy' and compare the irreversibility of co@ accumulation with the irreversibility of investments needed to moderate it. An option value for greenhouse gases emissions limitations is computed. "

"Europe went through the most severe economic crisis of its recent history following the global financial crisis of 2008. Hence, this thesis aims to empirically identify the determinants of this crisis within the framework of 15 core EU member countries (EU-15). To do so, the study develops a continuous fiscal stress index, contrary to previous empirical studies that tend to use event-based crisis indicators, which identifies the debt crises in the EU-15 and the study employs three different estimation techniques, namely Self-Organizing Map, Multivariate Logit and Panel Markov Regime Switching models. Our estimation results show first that the study identifies correctly the time and the length of the debt crisis in each EU-15-member country by developing a fiscal stress index. Empirical results also indicate, via three different models, that the debt crisis in the EU-15 is the consequence of deterioration of both financial and macroeconomic variables such as nonperforming loans over total loans, GDP growth, unemployment rates, primary balance over GDP, and cyclically adjusted balance over GDP. Besides, variables measuring governance quality, such as voice and accountability, regulatory quality, and government effectiveness, also play a significant role in the emergence and the duration of the debt crisis in the EU-15. As the econometric results clearly indicate the importance of fiscal deterioration on the occurrence of the European debt crisis, this study also aims to test the fiscal convergence among the EU member countries. The results indicate that Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain diverge from other EU-15 countries in terms of public debt-to-GDP ratio. In addition, results also show that all PIIGS countries except for Greece converge to EU-10 in terms of budget deficit-to-GDP ratio."
"This thesis focuses on the allocation of indivisible goods in presence of externality in individual preferences. This externality creates a difficulty with collecting full information about preferences. Therefore, conducting a normative analysis of allocation mechanisms requires assumptions on how reported preferences can be extended to preferences over outcomes. This approach is in line with the literature on preference domain restriction well-known in Social Choice theory. The first three chapters focus on Shapley-Scarf markets where trades are organized among coalitions. Coalitional trade generates externalities in individual valuations of allocations. Chapters 1 and 2 investigate domain restrictions ensuring the existence of various types of competitive equilibrium. Chapter 3 endows the set of goods with a geographical structure and considers distance to partners as a source of externality in preference. We identify domains of preference extensions which guarantee the existence of various types of core allocations. Chapter 4 focuses the case of pure public indivisible goods, which is formally identical to choosing a committee formed by several members, each selected from a specific set. We characterize preference domains over committees for which a well-defined seat-wise choice procedure based on majority voting is consistent with choosing a committee at once from majority voting."
"Cities are complex systems that urban models can help to comprehend. From simplistic models to more sophisticated ones, urban models have pushed forward our understanding the urban phenomenon and its intricacies. In this context, models can be of great value to policy makers providing that these tools become practical. In this regard, research has put little emphasis on the practicality of urban models and their use under operational conditions.To date, urban models which rely on spatial aggregation are the closest possibility to come to practical models. For this reason, the spatially aggregated modeling framework is widely used. This framework is relatively practical when compared to other modeling frameworks like microsimulation. Nevertheless, spatial aggregation is a serious source of bias in these models. This is especially the case of Land-Use and Transport Interaction (LUTI) models and more particularly of Four Step Models.The current PhD is committed to the study of spatial aggregation issues in traffic assignment models. Traffic assignment is responsable for the computation of travel times and travel conditions of present and future travel demand. Accessibility measurement, which is at the core of LUTI models, is tightly dependent on traffic assignment modeling and outcomes. Any bias in traffic assignment is likely to corrupt the overall modeling framework. In this context, a special attention is to be paid to spatial aggregation in traffic assignment models.In traffic assignment, spatial aggregation consists in grouping observations using zones or traffic analysis zones instead of using a continuous representation of space. By design, aggregation bears an implicit omission in data variability and thus a potential bias if this omission is not random. This is the case with the definition of centroid connectors and the omission of intrazonal demand in traffic assignment. With the use of zones as the basic spatial units, transport models require the use of centroid connectors to attach zones to the transportation network. Centroid connectors are introduced to model average access and egress conditions to and from the network. Nevertheless, average accessibility conditions are found to be too crude to render accurately accessibility conditions as encountered by trip makers. The current PhD explores the extent of the impact of this spatial aggregation bias in the case of transit models and suggests a new modeling strategy to overcome such modeling errors.The use of zones as spatial units induces a loss of intrazonal data. The omission of intrazonal trips in traffic assignment models is an example of such omission. This research introduces an uncertainty framework to study the statistical impact of ignoring intrazonal trips in traffic assignment models. Findings from this research are used to design new assignment strategies that are more robust towards the omission bias and more generally towards the spatial aggregation bias."
"Literature on social evaluations has mainly analyzed the “audience-candidate” dyad,leaving underexplored the way the evaluation of a main audience (e.g. a social-control agent)influences the evaluation of another audience. This dissertation looks at social evaluations in amultiple-audience context. It focuses on organizational social misconduct - an important, yetunderstudied social evaluation - and it investigates “Why does an audience change its evaluationfollowing organizational social misconduct?”. Each of the three essays focuses on a differentaudience (evaluation): people (people’s complaints), investors (share price) and the media(newspapers’ evaluation). Two novel settings and unique databases were used: advertising selfregulationin the UK and Calciopoli, the scandal that affected the Italian Serie A in 2006. Resultsshow that in case of organizational social misconduct, the evaluation of a social control agent doesinfluence the evaluation of another audience, however this effect is not mechanical. Three primarymoderators emerge from the three essays: the ambiguity of the norm, the saliency of the event, andlocalness of the transgressors. In summary, this dissertation shows that social norms are betterunderstood in a triadic framework: “candidate – social-control agent – another audience”. Socialnorms are not set exogenously, but are endogenously created by the actions of the candidates andthe evaluations of (at least) two audiences."
"Most organizations are based on projects, which can be of different types. In order to succeed in their implementation, different approaches and methods have appeared (performance systems, scorecards, performance indicators, etc) to help organizations to manage projects and to increase their performance. In fact, these tools and methods help to manage projects and to measure the progress of an activity and / or process project. However, it is important to ensure that the processes implemented are in continuous improvement and allow the project to achieve their objectives. Therefore, maturity models: Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3) and some others, are used as a framework to identify strengths and weaknesses of processes. They are limited however to providing ""best practices"" for achieving a higher maturity level and they do not provide the methods to evaluate and increase maturity in order to improve the processes. Also, the process of models establishment is very long which does not allow project maturity evaluation during the phases of the project life cycle. In this context, we achieved our research project with the aim of proposing a global approach to process improvement at three levels: Project, Project Support and Organization. Thus, this work suggests a modeling approach based on systems approach and the use of a model of maturity within the project life cycle. It leads to the establishment of an Assessment System of Project Maturity which includes a maturity model, a measurement methodology and a methodology to design continuous improvement action plans. The industrial application of this work has been carried out at PSA Peugeot Citroën and our approach has been implemented in four automotive projects. The findings of our research have contributed to the improvement of some project development processes."
"My dissertation aims at understanding the environmental and behavioral determinants of road traffic accidents in a developing country, India. To do so, a panel database on Indian states over a twelve year period has been built. A household survey among drivers and passengers of motorbikes has been also implemented in Delhi in 2011, this to overcome the absence of individual data on road habits. Chapter 1 is a macroeconomic study on the Indian subcontinent. The results found suggest that India should invest more particularly in road infrastructures, in the strict implementation of road rules and in education programs on road related risks. Given that 70% of motorized vehicles are two-wheelers in India, I decided to focus the rest of my analysis on this subgroup. Chapter 2 provides a presentation of the survey. I study in Chapter 3 the adequate measurement of risk aversion in the context of a developing country. I explore the impact of questions and interviewers on the elicited individuals' preferences towards risk. In Chapter 4, a theoretical model on the influence of risk aversion on prevention activities is first adapted to the road safety context. When looking at the data, we found that more risk averse drivers are more likely to wear a helmet while there is no significant effect on choice of speed. As for passengers, they seem to adapt their helmet use to their environment and in particular to their driver's skills. In Chapter 5, I show that previous experiences of road crash and police stop impact subjective expectations. Fear of injuries lead to a greater use of helmet on long distance journeys, while police threat rather determines the helmet use on short trips. "

"This thesis touches upon important aspects that involve the past, present and future of unconventional monetary policies (UMPs): their historical background and conceptual debate; the experience of UMPs in advanced economies, with the Euro area case; the effects of UMPs in emerging economies, and their links with corporate debt; the process of UMPs exit and the future of monetary policy frameworks. First, by reporting several historical experiences of the Bank of England, Federal Reserve System and Bank of Japan, we have observed that policies which after the 2008 crisis were considered to be “unconventional” had already been adopted in various occasions before. Second, on the conceptual debate, we analyzed UMPs framework (objectives, measures, transmission channels, and effects), with more detailed attention on nominal negative interest rates, measure which had not been implemented before 2008. Third, on UMPs experience in the Euro area, we observed that UMPs were capable of avoiding a major financial collapse after 2008, and managed partial improvements in macroeconomic indicators. In particular, sovereign yields have presented distinct responses according to each asset purchase program announced/implemented. However, UMPs were not able alone to solve all economic problems in the Euro area, which deserve the support of additional policies (fiscal, industrial, institutional, financial regulation/supervision) to ensure a sustained growth path in the medium/long term. Fourth, on UMPs effects in emerging economies, we have observed the important role of accommodative measures of the main advanced economies central banks, together with other global factors, to explain the rise of corporate debt. Its economic policy implications are related to the need for enhancement in financial regulation, macro and microprudential instruments to increase the resilience of the financial system against crises. Finally, the current process of UMPs exit is asynchronous, and gradual sequencing and proper communication will be required to avoid major disruptions in international financial markets. Future monetary policy frameworks may take lessons from past and recent experiences and incorporate some UMPs in their toolkits, in order to increase the effectiveness of monetary policies and reduce financial stability concerns, once the challenges posed by financial markets are increasingly higher."
"This thesis deals with earnings management in the context of innovative companies. It consists in three articles. In the first, we examine whether the earnings of innovative firms are managed and if the stage of development of innovations influences this earnings management. Results show that the results of innovative firms are managed upward. This earnings management seems to occur only during innovative activity (i.e. when firms invest in R&D); the completion of innovations not incenting to manage earnings.Based on this observation, in the second article, we wonder whether (i) R&D expenditures are capitalized in order to manage earnings or (ii) whether the capitalization of these expenditures is reliable accounting information. Our results show that R&D expenses are capitalized in order to manage earnings and more precisely to meet earnings targets. R&D capitalization is reliable only when managers have no incentive to achieve earnings targets. Finally, in the third article, we examine whether managers use jointly the adjustment of R&D expenditures and their capitalization in order to beat earnings targets. Results show that managers use these two earnings management techniques to beat zero earnings and analysts  earnings forecasts. However, R&D expenses are either capitalized or reduced to avoid a decrease of earnings."
"This thesis deals with voluntary disclosure of information during takeover bids. It consists of three articles that are concerned with a different step of the disclosure process in this context. The first article aims at explaining the voluntary disclosure decision of target companies by studying factors influencing disclosure during such transactions. The results highlight that this decision is mainly explained by the influence of contextual factors. The second article identifies, through a lexical analysis of voluntary press releases, the discourse strategies adopted by both bidding and target companies and the underlying motivations. Finally, in the third article, an experiment is conducted to investigate the influence of disclosure and impression management strategies of the targets of hostile bids on shareholders. It turns out that these strategies modify their perception of the bid and ultimately their decision to accept or reject the bid."
"In finance, model risk is the risk of loss resulting from using models. It is a complex risk which recover many different situations, and especially estimation risk and risk of model misspecification. This thesis focuses: on model risk inherent in yield and credit curve construction methods and the analysis of the consistency of Sobol indices with respect to stochastic ordering of model parameters. it is divided into three chapters. Chapter 1 focuses on model risk embedded in yield and credit curve construction methods. We analyse in particular the uncertainty associated to the construction of yield curves or credit curves. In this context, we derive arbitrage-free bounds for discount factor and survival probability at the most liquid maturities. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, we quantify the impact of parameter risk through global sensitivity analysis and stochastic orders theory. We analyse in particular how Sobol indices are transformed further to an increase of parameter uncertainty with respect to the dispersive or excess wealth orders. Chapter 3 of the thesis focuses on contrast quantile index. We link this latter with the risk measure CTE and then we analyse on the other side, in which circumstances an increase of a parameter uncertainty in the sense of dispersive or excess wealth orders implies and increase of contrast quantile index. We propose finally an estimation procedure for this index. We prove under some conditions that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal"
"Following power market reforms, market design, i.e. the study of new markets to replace efficiently the previous monopoly, becomes central in the economic literature. However, due to several technical characteristics of electricity, this task is complex. A third party is then required to help design these markets in an efficient way and to set the rules under which private decentralized market players will interact. This complexity explains why market design remains a work in progress. This thesis contributes to the current discussions by giving insights on the most efficient market designs to implement to ensure the reliability of power systems.A first focus is made on the short-term dimension of reliability, i.e. the security of power systems. To maintain a balanced system, the system operator has to ensure the availability of a sufficient level of reserves in real time: this is the aim of the security model. In this thesis, a quantitative assessment of the economic impacts that a transition to a different security model would have for the French power system is carried out. An agent-based modelling is developed to simulate the decisions of profit-maximizing players on several short-term markets. Simulations show that the current French security model results in lower costs than the alternative one implemented in several European countries, and should therefore be maintained for the French power system.A second focus is made on the long-term dimension of reliability, i.e. the adequacy. The economic performances of a capacity market and a strategic reserve mechanism, two mechanisms designed to solve the adequacy issue, are compared. In order to capture the cyclical nature of investments, these mechanisms are studied from a dynamic point of view. To this end, a long-term model is developed based on a System Dynamics approach. It simulates the investment and shutdown decisions made by market players considering their imperfect behaviours. Main results show that the capacity market solves the adequacy issue at a lower cost than the strategic reserve mechanism."
"The topics presented in this thesis are related to new optimization techniques for solving some challenging problems resulting from finance. They are large-scale non convex optimization problems for which finding efficient solving methods is currently the topic of numerous researches. Our work is based mainly on DC (Difference of Convex functions) programming and DCA (DC Algorithm). This approach is motivated by the robustness and efficiency of DC programming and DCA approaches in comparison to the other methods. The thesis is divided into two parts and consists of seven chapters. In the first part entitled Methodology ; we present theoretical tools and algorithms that we are going to use in the thesis. The first chapter is about DC programming and DCA and the second focuses on branch and bound algorithms. In the second part we develop DC programming and DCA for solving some problems in finance. We begin with an introduction to the modern portfolio theory (The Chapter 3). The Chapter 4 is dedicated to the generalizations of the mean variance (MV) model of Markowitz, where we study the MV model under the buy-in threshold constraints, threshold constraints, and cardinality constraints. The Chapter 5 is devoted to the portfolio selection problem under downside risk measure and cardinality constraints. The Chapter 6 deals with the portfolio optimization under step increasing transaction costs functions. Finally, the robust investment strategies with discrete asset choice constraints are developed in the last chapter."
"This thesis is made of three distinct chapters. In the first chapter, I test whether the display format of financial information matters for the individual investor. I find that a more efficient information display allows investors to increase returns on their limit orders, because it becomes easier for them to mitigate the risk of adverse selection when trading with those orders. My findings suggest that retail investors have bounded rationality. In the second chapter I test whether liquidity provision to the market can be a profitable strategy, after fees, for active retail investors. I find that only individuals ranked in the top decile of performance can persistently beat the market using highly contrarian limit order strategies. Limits-to-arbitrage seem to explain why these top retail investors exploit trading opportunities before other more sophisticated arbitrageurs. In the third chapter, I study the retail trading strategies around stock earnings announcements. I find that round-trips started one day before an announcement are more profitable and much shorter in duration than those started during the non-announcement period. Retails reverse their winning trades on the event date, which can slow down the adjustment of prices to new information."
"The purpose of this thesis is twofold. It first aims to enrich the understanding of practices considering how they are related to norms without restricting our view to a binary approach of opposition or not. It also intends to deepen the knowledge about first-line managers' practices in the internal mobility management process. While fundamental, these practices still remain poorly explored. Adopting a « HRM-in-practice » and an abductive perspective, this thesis relies on the study of a large public company that intends to give its managers a key role in internal mobility process. This study reveals a diversity of first-line managers' HR practices even though they are faced with the same top management's norms that severely restrict their formal leeway. By introducing the concepts of deviance and bricolage into the Practice Perspective's analysis framework, we show that this diversity conceals four different ways of behaving towards norms: in addition to opposition or not to norms, practices can also apply them with more or Jess distance. The distinction of these practices regarding the consideration of norms with or without deviance and bricolage first highlights the differentiation in used resources and action logics. These practices can also be considered as local adaptations to tensions related either to current norms or to the internal mobility management system. We finally show that the different practices that have been identified contribute to the construction of internal mobility in different ways."
"The Countries in the Middle East and North Africa are known for their wealth and diversity as a result of a decades-long economic and political history. They extend over a vast expanse from the Persian Gulf to the east, to the Atlantic Ocean to the west. This region sometimes referred to as MENA (Middle East and North Africa) includes most of Southwest Asia and North Africa. It includes on the Asian continent Iran, Turkey and all the Arab countries. In North Africa, it includes Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Morocco and Algeria.This thesis begins with a first part devoted to the geography and history of the main countries of the region, starting with the last decades lived by the Ottoman Empire.In the second part we present an economic and social panorama of the countries of the zone.In the third part we focus on monetary policy. This policy is one of the most important economic policies, as its success is supposed to contribute to the success and development of other policies. We analyze the problematic relations between the executive government and the central bank as monetary authority."
"This thesis contributes to the analysis of the relationship between farm’s forms of organization and environmental performance. The links between the way in which farm is organized and governed and all the practices related with its environmental profile will be studied. First, the economic literature about environmental performance of farms and its determinants will be reviewed. Based on the insights of the neo-institutional and the evolutionary economics, an analytical framework of the relationship between forms of organization and environmental profiles will be proposed. This framework will then be applied to dairy farms in three complementary chapters. These chapters combine both quantitative approach using data from the French agricultural census of 2010 and a qualitative approach from semi-directive interviews carried out in Brazil. An insight to the empirical literature on environmental performance will be provided thanks to a systemic and multi-criteria approach of dairy farms thought a profile of agro-environmental practices. The analysis of the determinants also shows the importance of studying the farm as complex system with its own structure, governance and adaptability evolving in its external environment. Finally, the thesis bring out that there is no strict alignment between forms of organization and environmental performance. However, certain forms are more apt than others to take into account certain agro-environmental practices."
"We study retail investors’ behavior on financial markets by combining the MiFID questionnaire answers and banking records of more than 98,000 retail clients of a large European retail bank. First, we study stock market participation. We show that retail clients’ self-assessed risk tolerance and attitudes towards losses are strong drivers of stockholding while controlling for classical determinants. Second, under the mental accounting framework, we derive a typology of retail client mental goals and show that retail clients’ actual investment decisions are consistent with their mental goals. Finally, we analyze the behavior of investors directly holding at least one foreign individual stock. We show that they hold more diversified stock portfolios than domestic investors. These sophisticated investors are more risk tolerant, less sensitive to losses and more financially literate but are subject to the home bias."
"This thesis studies financial fragility, i.e. the sensitivity of the financial system with respect to shocks. the main issue of financial fragility in the current context is the increased financial complexity. To address this problem, this study draws inspiration from two relatively recent streams of literature : econopmics of networks and behavioral economics. The main concepts in use are diffusion, cascade and bounded rationality. Chapter 1 studies how petterns of links, specifically, the length of transitive cycles affect the extent of financial contagion. Chapter 2 proposes a dynamic model in which bank runs arise as cascades of withdrawals. The aim is to better understand how bank runs occur. Chapter 3 studies bank runs in a dynamic and behavioral setting, with herding and heterogeneity of depositors."
"Brownfield redevelopment is a key priority topreserve soils. Brownfields are often contaminated yet.Therefore, it creates numerous obstacles to reuse them.Firstly, brownfields redevelopment’s benefits areunderestimated whereas costs are overestimated bydevelopers. Secondly, brownfields are plagued with thestigma effect. This effect persists even after remediationprocess (e.g., individuals may not use facilities on aformer contaminated brownfield). Thirdly, new uses cancause conflicts between the stakeholders. As such, thisthesis deals with contaminated brownfieldredevelopment taking into account both themultidimensionality of stakeholders, their preferencesand their perceptions. developers. In a first part, we study barriers to brownfieldredevelopment and how to tackle them using a surveyamong 76 French developers.In a second part, weanalyse the importance of the stigma associated withcontaminated brownfields. A first survey (803observations), conducted at national level, investigatesindividuals’ perceptions, representations and preferencesregarding brownfield redevelopment. A second survey(338 observations), conducted among five municipalitiesimpacted by such sites, specifies their preferences usinga discrete choice experiment. In the third part, we applya participatory multicriteria decision aid. It determinesthe most consensual projects in the case of acontaminated site. They correspond to individuals’preferences that were previously analysed."
"A « mode of coordination » is a concept that define the interaction between social relations and economy. The latter, which cannot be separated from politics, develops through the functioning of different institutional forms. Several methods of coordination have been identified in the literature, namely, the « market mode of coordination », the « ethics mode of coordination » and the « bureaucratic mode coordination mode ». Vahabi (2010) introduced a new type of coordination that he called it: the ""destructive mode of coordination."" This mode privilege violence and coercive means in social relations and provides an appropriate allocation of resources. Vahabi present Iranian Republic as a typical example of ""destructive mode of coordination"" because of the nature of its capitalism and corruption of its political system in the management of resources. We are interested in this research, to examine to what extent the case of Lebanon can be analyzed as a destructive mode of coordination."
"This thesis investigates how individuals make decisions under risk and uncertainty. It is composed of four essays that theoretically and experimentally investigate decision-making.The first two essays study situations where a decision maker has to decide whether an event has occurred using uncertain evidence. Accurately identifying that this event has occurred is more rewarded than accurately identifying that it has not occurred. This decision problem induces a divergence between two qualities of a decision: optimality and accuracy. Both essays reproduce such situations in a laboratory experiment based on perceptual tasks and analyze behavior using Signal Detection Theory to study the optimality-accuracy trade-off. The first essay confirms the existence of the trade-off with a leading role of accuracy. It explains the trade-off by the concern of individuals for being right. The second chapter finds that presenting perceptual evidence last contributes to the existence of the optimality-accuracy trade-off.The third essay studies how other-regarding preferences interact with attitude toward ambiguity. It reports the results of an experiment where subjects have to make donations to charities. Donations may have either ambiguous costs or ambiguous benefits. We find that other-regarding preferences are decreased under ambiguity. In other terms, we highlight that individual use ambiguity has an excuse not to give. This excuse-driven behavior is stronger for ambiguous costs than ambiguous benefits.The fourth essay challenges the external validity of laboratory risk preference measures using behavior in experimental risk tasks and naturally occurring behavior under risk. We find that risk preference measures are related with the former but that they fail to explain the latter."
"This PhD thesis has as objective to examine the place and the importance of accessibility in location choice models of households and firms, two key construction elements of Land-Use Transport Interaction models. More specifically, the aim is to analyse the effect of various methodological choices from a theoretical and empirical point of view in order to give some answers to theoretical, methodological, empirical and policy issues. Having as a case study the urban area of Lyon and using discrete models to explain the location choices of households and firms, four research papers comprise the main work of this dissertation.In the first paper, the objective was to analyse the effect of the accessibility measure on the results of residential location choice model. While accessibility has always been important at theoretical level, at empirical level, some works questioned its importance, considering other location characteristics as more influential. This paper examines whether different accessibility measurement methods can lead to divergent results. The conclusion is that accessibility is an indispensable variable for residential location choice models and the conclusion remains the same whatever is the measure. Without accessibility, the model gives inconsistent results. Complex accessibility measures give better results, especially for predictions, but simple measures are also relevant for residential location choices modelling.In the second paper, the objective was to analyse the differences of accessibility preferences between new and relocating firms. Accessibility is one of the most important attributes of a location choice of an economic establishment. However, even if it seems intuitive, works analysing any differences between creations and relocations are scarce. Using data from eighteconomic sectors and comparing creations to relocations, the results demonstrate that the effect of accessibility differs between in the same economic sector.In the third paper, the objective was to evaluate the difference of the accessibility impact on the location choices of firms of the business services sector. Distinguishing between Front Office and Back Office business services in a location choice model, the results demonstrate that the effect of accessibility differs between economic subsectors.In the fourth paper, the objective was to analyse the temporal evolution of the preferences for accessibility for residential choices. More and more people choose to buy a residence at the suburbs taking advantage of the accessibility increase. At the same time, young households, the so called millennials, choose to rent in central areas. Distinguishing between renters andowners, the analysis of the elasticities for 1999, 2006 and 2013 confirm the initial intuition. Renters were always more sensitive to accessibility to employment. More importantly, renters show an increasing preference for accessibility during the analysis period, while the owners the opposite. We suggest that planners and model developers should integrate temporal dynamics into their models in order to anticipate better future tendencies."
"We explore Information and Communication Technology (ICT) support to organizational improvisation during crisis response by completing three studies. The first study confirms diversity in research on improvisation and suggests that author’s perspectives on improvisation diverge with respect to four tasks within the research process. The second study identifies five constituents of organizational improvisation. In addition, it reports six ICT properties that promote the settling of appropriate conditions for interaction during organizational improvisation in crisis response. In the empirical work, we provide a more integrative picture of ICT support to organizational improvisation in crisis response by retrospectively observing crisis responders’ interactions during the 2003 French heat wave. Our empirical findings suggest that improvisation enables crisis responders to cope with organizational emptiness that burdens crisis response. However, crisis responders’ participation in organizational improvisation depends on their communicative genres. During the 2003 French heat wave crisis, administrative actors who had developed what we call a dispassionate communicative genre in relation to their email use, barely participated in organizational improvisation. Conversely, improvisers mainly communicated in what we call a fervent communicative genre. Therefore, our findings reveal that the ICT support to organizational improvisation in crisis response is mediated by the communication practices and strategies that groups of crisis responders develop around ICT tools"
"The main objectives of this thesis are to explain the emergence of competitive dynamics characterized by a symbiosis between competition and market power and to elucidate how they can be apprehended through the lenses of competition theory. Chapter I investigates the evolution of forms of competition in the United States from 1840 to today. We show that while in some cases market power has translated into hindering competition (and vice versa), in others the two establish a symbiotic relation. Chapter II reviews competition theories and concludes that they do not account for the coexistence of two major stylized facts characteristic of the current hegemonic form of competition: long-run profit rate differentials and strong price competition. Chapter III develops a contribution to competition theory within and between global value chains (GVC). We show that uneven interdependence is the source of intra-GVC market power, which explains long-run profit rate differentials between firms belonging to the same GVC. Then we show how they can be compatible with strong price competition. Chapter IV studies platform capitalism with a focus on “trust-based algorithmic coordination” (TBAC) firms. Building on the case of the ride-hailing firm Uber, we argue that the TBAC firm conjugates vertical market power with strong price competition in a competitive dynamics in which there is a tendency towards monopolization."
"Facing increasingly violent anti-advertising movements and a diversion of individuals from a strong advertising pressure, marketing has to rethink traditional communication strategies. From this perspective, brand placement appears to be an effective way to promote a brand, a product or a service to individuals. We study the impact of brand placement on the behavior of the consumer in a musical consumer experience. In this context, we present the development of the real-time measurement tool, the Continous Responses Digital Interface. Through an experiment with 240 individuals, we test and validate the research model and the CRDI tool, on two different audiovisual supports. The statistical processing carried out using SmartPLS software highlights short-term memorial effects of brand placement in the audiovisual medium. In addition, our research model highlights the role of flow as a mediator of the relationship between immersion and satisfaction."
"E-Opinion Leaders (e-OL) identification on internet social networks is a major issue for marketing managers. This thesis deals with the role, status and identification of  these e-OL. Each one of these three aspects are subject to controversial debates in the literature. Three studies are conducted within this thesis. They provide complementary and crossed answers to these debates. Regarding the e-OL status, we offer a definition for the e-OL concept in the specific context of internet social networks within three main characteristics: expertise in the product category, the will to publish valuable contents for their contacts, and the will to develop their social capital. Then, for the e-OL identification, we develop a new and multidimensional measurement scale for this concept. This scale shows good external validity. We confront it with others e-LO measures inspired by traditional OL measures, but also with alternative identification methods as the Twitter profile indicators and the Klout score algorithm. Finally, we test four models and their variants in order to better understand the origin and mechanism of the main e-LO role: the e-influence. We especially show that e-OL has an impact on e-influence. We also show that confidence mediates the link between e-LO and e-influence. These results speak to the relevance of e-OL in a viral marketing perspective."
"The aim of this thesis is to provide Bank Audi with econometric tools for sake of a more robust risk management. Lebanese businesses today are faced with greater challenges than ever before, both economical and political, and there is a question about the future of the middle east region after the Syrian civil war. Thus, Lebanese commercial banks face greater complications in the management of interest rate and liquidity risk. The first part of this thesis discusses interest rate risk management and measurement in the Lebanese market. First, we seek to build the Lebanese term structure. This market is known by its illiquidity, yields for a given maturity make a large jump with a small impact on other yields even if close to this maturity. Therefore, we face challenges in calibrating existing yield curve models. For this matter, we get historical prices of bonds issued by the Lebanese government, and denominated in Local currency and in US dollar. A new estimation method has been added to Nelson Siegel and Svensson model, we call it “Correlation Constraint Approach”. Model parameters can be interpreted from economical perspective which will be helpful in forecasting yield curve movements based on economist’s opinion. On the second hand, traditional customer deposits are the main funding source of Lebanese commercial banks (80-85% of liabilities). Although they are contractually short term (mainly one month) paying fixed interest rates, these deposits are historically known to be a stable source of funding and therefore exhibit a sticky behavior to changes in market interest rates. We develop an error correction model showing a long-run equilibrium between Libor and Lebanese banking sector average rate offered on USD deposits. Results make it possible to determine the behavioral duration (repricing date) of customer deposits when market interest rates fluctuate. Therefore, the behavioral duration of liabilities will be higher than the contractual one which will lower the duration gap between assets and liabilities and thus the negative impact of positive interest rate shocks. After understanding interest risk profile of customers’ deposits, we start the second part by determining their behavioral liquidation maturity. We get Bank Audi’s historical deposits outstanding balances filtered into the following categories: currency, account typology and residency of depositor. We develop an error correction model for each filter. Results show relationship between deposits behaviors, the coincident indicator and spreads between offered rates in the Lebanese market. The model will lead to assess behavioral liquidation maturity to deposits and understand their liquidity risk profile. This will be helpful for the funding liquidity risk management at Bank Audi. Large financial institutions are supposed to hold large positions of given assets. The last topic is related to market liquidity risk management. We suppose an investor holds a large position of a given asset. Then at time 0, a severe shock causes a large depreciation of the asset value and makes the investor decides to liquidate the portfolio as soon as possible with limited losses. Stock returns are modeled by GARCH process which has tail behaviors after large variation at time 0. Trading on liquid and illiquid markets, we provide the trader with best exit trading strategy maximizing his utility function, finally we incorporate into the model an expert opinion which will help the investor in taking the decision"
"Our research aims to identify, for the PSP PACA our socio-economic partner, the possible ways to support the innovation activity of its members and the home-care services field players. Firstly, based on an expanded literature review, we built a theoretical model of analysis allowing us to highlight all the cognitive, political, constructive and productive fundamental activities in the implementation of entrepreneurial projects intended to transform or strengthen a field. Thus, we rely on a project-based view literature and on three sets of literature on the appropriation of human artefacts. Secondly, we mobilized this model of analysis in the in-depth reading of two cases of projects carried out by the PSP PACA, setting up collective actions. Mobilizing this analytical model allowed us to examine the different ways (organization, collective animation and individual support) by which the PSP team carried out theses collective actions, and their subsequent impact on the activities. It also allowed us to identify, in context, the elements that were appropriated or adopted by the participants while conducting their own projects. We then highlighted a certain number of methodological levers, on which the team of the cluster can rely to optimize - according to its aims and its orientations - the organization and the animation of such collective actions. We articulated these levers according to four different modalities in order to facilitate their mobilization by participants or project carriers. These results then led us to put forward three main axes of theoretical discussion"
"This PhD thesis deals with the standardization of environmental accounting. It consists of three papers (empirical studies) that explore different facets of stakeholder participation in the process of standardizing environmental accounting. The three studies are based on the case study of the standardization of the environmental accounting of the products underlying the projects ""environmental labelling of consumer products"" in France and the development of the European Product Environmental Footprint. We have focused on three levels of analysis.The first article (macro level) focuses on identifying and exploring the institutional work conducted by marginalized actors to participate in standardization processes. In the second article (meso level), we are interested in the intermediaries of standardization (consultants specializing in environmental accounting) and in particular how they use and mobilize the standardization bodies to maintain their expertise and to establish the professionalism of their activity. Finally, in the third article (micro level) we are interested in a standardization participant (a multinational) in which we try to understand how participation in a process of standardization of environmental accounting is influenced by the work carried out internally within an organization and, conversely, how, during its participation, the standardization process influenced the functioning of the organization and its CSR approach. The overall results contribute to a better understanding of how standardization stakeholders are involved in the process of standardizing environmental accounting."
"The globalization of markets imposes imperatives on the competitiveness of companies and has consequences for the environment and humans. In this context, researchers propose sustainable development (SD) as an alternative to preserve our environmental and social heritage. Companies as major players in our society must play their part. Among these, smalland medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are more numerous and important in our economies, their responsibilities are all the more important. To be competitive and survive for the competition that comes from everywhere, they have no other choice than to innovate and deploy their strategies by developing products that are more respectful of the environment.Moreover, without a critical mass of SMEs engaged in SD, this project would be unachievable. To do this, integrating both new products and SD in their management 6 approach would be a way for SMEs to be responsible while being competitive. Howeve, the question is can they do it taking into account the lack of resources and know-how in the field of SD. What motivates SMEs to engage in sustainable development? This is the central question that is the subject of our study.Previous studies showed that corporate commitment to SD is motivated by financial advantage or concerns about reputation. Large companies have begun to pay attention to the process of sustainable development, SMEs seem to be lagging behind and yet they have specific characteristics such as organizational flexibility, proximity to local actors that favor the implementation of this process. However, many SMEs still hesitate to engage in the practice of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) for lack of resources and fear of return on investment. There is a dearth of research on how SMEs perceive and implement the concept,particularly from a developing countries perspective. This study helps to fill these gaps by examining how sustainable development is perceived and practiced by SMEs in Vietnam. In a developing and transition economy like Vietnam, financial, human, technological and institutional resources are limited and sustainable development is interpreted in a national and cultural context, so a CSR study in the SME sector is particularly important. The empirical study conducted in 4 articles with 2000 manufacturing SMEs explores to what extent the concept of CSR is understood and adopted by Vietnamese SMEs. Stakeholder, entrepreneurship and resource base theory were used primarily as they help to understand the phenomenon of sustainable entrepreneurship, especially in a country-specific research framework. Stakeholder and entrepreneurial theoriesare used to explain CSR SME engagement in Article 01. Stakeholder theory is used in Article 03 and partly in Article 02 to examine the impacts of different actors on sustainable strategic choices. In this article 02 we also use the neo-institutional theory to explain the diffusion mechanism of CSR practice in international trade. The resource theory is useful in explaining the barriers to SME CSR practice (Article 04)."
"Financial inclusion has become an important topic in the last two decades in WAEMU's development policies. This area is characterized by a low level of financial inclusion despite several strategies and programs to strengthen it. This thesis aims to analyze on the one hand the situation of the financial inclusion of UEMOA and Niger in particular, and on the other hand, to study the role of microfinance in the fulfillment of the latter. To do this, we built a synthetic financial inclusion index (ISIF) to measure financial inclusion and thus classify the 8 WAEMU countries. Through an econometric panel model, we have shown that microfinance effectively contributes to strengthening financial inclusion in terms of mobile money and the impact (on ISIF) is greater than that of the banking sector. In addition, we analyzed the determinants of financial inclusion at two levels: first, at the country level, and from the data available at the BCEAO and then according to the characteristics of the individuals using the data. of the survey we conducted with a sample of 512 adults. These data also revealed a worrying level of financial education in both rural and urban areas of Niger"
"Observing a lack of academic consensus about R&D public supports efficaciency, we focus on public R&D funding policies by considering R&D cooperation and proximity between firms and a public research sector.  In a first way, we introduce how economic literature studies incentives to promote R&D efforts. In addition, we decide to illustrate our theorotical approach through french cluster policy called « politique des pôles de compétitivité ». In a second way, we develop an original theorotical modelisation able to evaluate the efficacity of three public instruments that promote R&D efforts and innovation : promote R&D cooperation, subsidizing private R&D sector and funding to public research sector. Our theorotical results lead us to make some recommandations to the policy makers. First, we conclude to an additionality effect of public policies on R&D efforts, that means we reject all crowding-out effect of public intervention. Moreover, we show that funding a public research sector (SPU policy) leads to better performance than the policy consisting to subsidize private R&D efforts (SPR policy) but only if the level of public spillovers is strong enough. Then, about the distribution of public fundings between public and private sector (SPM policy), we conclude that the proportion allocated to private sector always increases with the level of inter-firm spillovers and with the concentration of the industry if and only if the level of inter-firm spillovers is high enough.  In the opposite,  this proportion allocated to private sector decreases with the level of public knowledge externalities  to the private sector, due to a closer proximity between public and private bodies, regardless of whether firms cooperate or not in R&D."
"Environmental problems, especially those related to the global warming have attracted extensive attention from the decision makers of companies. Their concerns on the environmental problems lead them to a reform of the mode of management. For the decision makers from industry who have to face the CO2 problem, whether they can be supported by the local government with respect to managing CO2 emissions becomes non trivial. In this thesis, we interviewed 50 decision makers from industries, government, and academic community. The significance of the CO2 problem in site selection is comprehensively evaluated. Our observations suggest that the CO2 problem is a minor factor. It can be measured by the cost. For the local government, there is no need to invest in the infrastructures of CO2 treatment at present. Our results thus provide a better understanding of the CO2 problem for the decision makers of local industries."
"The purpose of this research is the construction of a socio-environmental accounting tool in a context of researchintervention, within a company of the Social Economy, by a person belonging to this organization. The transformative aim of this intervention is the inscription of this organization within strong sustainability. The aim is to answer the following questions: What tool design in order to meet these expectations? Does it exist, or does it have to be created? What elements of the organization's context influence its adoption? Can the transformation goal be achieved? If so, under what conditions? The concept of sustainability and its existing accounting translations are examined. The way in which the design of the tool influences its adoption and the transformative potential of a tool of this type are then studied. Not having identified a tool that meets the initial expectations, we developed a triple capital accounts system without monetization. Although this model has limitations that require further research, it proposes an operationalization of strong sustainability of capitals (social and environmental) as complex adaptive systems. In doing so, it identifies the operational difficulties to this type of approach. It underlines how strong sustainability accounting is essentially accounting for the unsustainability of organizations, and the impact of this feature on the adoption of such a tool. Processes to improve its acceptability are finally proposed."
"During the past 2 decades, health has become a more and more important role in our economy life: on the one hand, we observe a significant improvement of average lifespan across the globe, on the other hand, the health expenditures is also increasing enormously, which has become a shake to the public health system of many countries. In this dissertation, we begin with these 2 stylized facts but we also show that  there is more to it: though the average level of health has been improved significantly, health related inequalities are still being reported and actually tend to increase, plus, we also show that countries with important health expenditures performs generally poorly in terms of health system efficiency, in short, this improvement of human health we are talking about seems to benefit more those who can pay the bills. In order to figure out what causes this phenomenon and eventually propose practical solutions that help solve the problem, in this dissertation we take 2 approaches: first we start with the deterministic approach and also the more theoretical approach, in this approach we build our model based on the Grossman health capital model and we examine how people would behave when their health fluctuates, then we turn to the second approach, which is the stochastic approach and also the more practical approach, in this approach we use the Markov chain to simulate the real health risk and examine the behaviors of individuals of different social-economic status(SES) under this circumstance,  we also aggregate these behaviors to see what impact could be generated on the whole society and we test reversely how these behavior would affected by public policies."
"This thesis aims to evaluate and analyse the direct and indirect effects of the Rhône-Alpes Technological Research Institutes (IRTs), which are one of the innovation policy devices based on science-industry transfers, created in France as pait of the Future Investment Programme. By applying a difference-in-difference model combined with matching methods, the results show a direct positive effect on turnover and financial autonomy and indicate that this effect varies according to the duration of participation and the type of assistance received. In addition, the type of assistance would play a more important role than the duration of treatment in the effectiveness of TRis. The results also indicate that the TRI had positive indirect effects on turnover, financial autonomy and the share of executives of non-directly beneficiary SMEs but located in the treated area and that these effects do not appear immediately after the treatment but a few years later. In addition, this research work assesses and analyses the direct effects of TRis by focusing on the R&D performance of large companies. Using the random trend model and the synthetic control model, the results of the first model indicate that participation in TRis has had an additional direct effect on total net R&D expenditures and that these expenditures are largely self-­financed and used outside the company through collaborations and outsourcing. The results of the second model show that a single company has almost systematic effects on all R&D performance indicators."
"The purpose of this thesis is to identify policies that would allow to mitigate road freight GHG emissions at the lowest cost for the community. With this in mind, for six scenarios corresponding to different mitigation policies we estimate the mitigated emissions along with the economic cost, over the 2030-2050 period. The overall economic cost includes the cost for transport users, for public authorities, and an economic valuation of transport externalities. When available, we used sets of assumptions retained by the French Ministry of Transports for official traffic projections and for the unitary valuation of external costs. For every scenario, the economic cost by avoided ton of CO2 is highly sensitive to these assumptions, especially to the unitary value of external costs (valuation of co-benefits). In the central set of assumptions, several scenarios result in a negative economic cost of GHG mitigation, id est a benefit to the community in addition to GHG cuts.This is notably the case for the carbon tax, as long as it remains lower than the external costs of freight road transportation. However, when the tax rate is rising, the resulting increase in transport prices leads shippers to reduce their activity, which limits the desirable tax rate increase. Increasing the maximum authorized weight of heavy trucks from 40 to 60 tons would be a very beneficial measure towards transport users by allowing a substantial transport costs reduction. This scenario is also beneficial for the community, when accounting for the avoided external costs, the financial loss for public authorities and infrastructure costs (the required reinforcement of roads and bridges and increased maintenance costs). The installation of catenaries on motorways to supply hybrid heavy trucks is efficient to reduce CO2 emissions, and the economic cost per avoided ton of CO2 remains moderate. Quite the opposite, the economic cost is high in the scenario of electrification of urban freight (where diesel trucks are replaced by electric trucks for urban goods delivery), if electric trucks only have a maximum payload of 2 tons. On the contrary, it turns into an economic benefit if, thanks to technological progress, electric trucks have a payload of 6 tons in 2030, for a range of 100 km.The replacement of diesel trucks by natural gas vehicles reduces transport costs and is therefore beneficial towards carriers and loaders, but public authorities support a loss of taxation revenues. However, when accounting for the avoided external costs, the overall economic cost happens to be limited.Finally, shippers can reduce GHG emissions for a reasonable economic cost by reducing the frequency of shipments, this measure also being beneficial for the community.However, none of these measures is capable to achieve by itself the official goal of dividing by 4 the level of GHG emissions at a reasonable cost for the community, implying that additional measures have to be considered jointly"
"This thesis examines the relationship between the governance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and branding strategies. Based on a dual approach, disciplinary (agency theory) and cognitive (stewardship theory), and taking into consideration the specificity of SMEs in governance and strategy, we propose a theoretical framework for analyzing this link. An empirical application to the agri-food SMEs in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (South of  France) through two surveys reveals several determinants of branding strategies.
Our research uses a methodology combining both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The first survey is based on questionnaires extracted data from a panel of agri-food companies followed over a period of seven years as part of the EAA survey (339 companies in 2002 and 322 companies in 2009). A second qualitative survey was conducted through semi-structured interviews with managers in 9 agri-food SMEs.
The results show that the ownership structure, the shareholders' goals, the decision-making process and the characteristics of the manager influence the choices of products brand. In particular, we prove that family businesses massively choose to commercialize their products without brands, the shareholders' enterprises use their own brand and subcontract brands, and the cooperative companies offer products with an own brand and signs of quality such as DOP and PGI. Beyond the factors linked to the type of governance, other determinants have a significant effect on the choice of brands such as the size of the SME, the sector of activity or also the crises and external factors."
"This thesis starts from the observation that a credit portfolio is subject to several risks, mainly due to the credit quality of the borrower and his behavior toward his credit lines (drawdown or prepayment). It turns out that the observed risks are dynamic and depend on various factors, both micro and macroeconomic. Our goal in one hand is to understand the articulation of these risks in order to efficiently manage them in the current time, in the other hand, we want to have a forward looking vision of these risks with respect to the changes in the economic conditions in order to have a pro-active management. To address our objectives, we have articulated our research on three axes that have resulted in three chapters in the form of articles.(i) Analysis of changes in the credit ratings with respect to risk factors. The use of factor migration models allowed us to reproduce some stylized facts mentioned in academic literature and to identify some others. We have also estimated the business cycle between2006 and 2014, which manages to capture the crises of 2008 and 2012.(ii) Design of a cash-_ow model that considers the changes in borrowers' behavior under the influence of their micro and macroeconomic environments. We prove the influence of the credit ratings, business cycle, estimated recovery rates and short-term interest rates on the utilization rates of a credit line. This model also provides risk measures such as Cash Flow-at-Risk and Stressed Cash Flow-at-Risk on credit portfolio using Monte Carlo simulations.(iii) Discussion on the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) of an ambiguity neutral decision maker (DM) in order to reduce the risk in presence of ambiguity over probabilities. We show that the introduction of ambiguity through several ambiguity sources modifies the welfare level of all ambiguity-neutral and risk-averse DM when ambiguity and risk interact"
"The income distribution of a population, the distribution of failure times of a system and the evolution of the surplus in with-profit policies - studied in economics and management - are related to continuous functions belonging to the class of functionals of the distribution function. Our thesis covers the kernel estimation of some functionals of the distribution function with applications in economics and management. In the first chapter, we offer local polynomial estimators in the i.i.d. case of two functionals of the distribution function, written LF and TF , which are useful to produce the smooth estimators of the Lorenz curve and the scaled total time on test transform. The estimation method is described in Abdous, Berlinet and Hengartner (2003) and we prove the good asymptotic behavior of the local polynomial estimators. Until now, Gastwirth (1972) and Barlow and Campo (1975) have defined continuous piecewise estimators of the Lorenz curve and the scaled total time on test transform, which do not respect the continuity of the original curves. Illustrations on simulated and real data are given. The second chapter is intended to provide smooth estimators in the i.i.d. case of the derivatives of the two functionals of the distribution function presented in the last chapter. Apart from the estimation of the first derivative of the function TF with a smooth estimation of the distribution function, the estimation method is the local polynomial approximation of functionals of the distribution function detailed in Berlinet and Thomas-Agnan (2004). Various types of convergence and asymptotic normality are obtained, including the probability density function and its derivatives. Simulations appear and are discussed. The starting point of the third chapter is the Parzen-Rosenblatt estimator (Rosenblatt (1956), Parzen (1964)) of the probability density function. We first improve the bias of this estimator and its derivatives by using higher order kernels (Berlinet (1993)). Then we find the modified conditions for the asymptotic normality of these estimators. Finally, we build a method to remove boundary effects of the estimators of the probability density function and its derivatives, thanks to higher order derivatives. We are interested, in this final chapter, in the hazard rate function which, unlike the two functionals of the distribution function explored in the first chapter, is not a fraction of two linear functionals of the distribution function. In the i.i.d. case, kernel estimators of the hazard rate and its derivatives are produced from the kernel estimators of the probability density function and its derivatives. The asymptotic normality of the first estimators is logically obtained from the second ones. Then, we are placed in the multiplicative intensity model, a more general framework including censored and dependent data. We complete the described method in Ramlau-Hansen (1983) to obtain good asymptotic properties of the estimators of the hazard rate and its derivatives and we try to adopt the local polynomial approximation in this context. The surplus rate in with-profit policies will be nonparametrically estimated as its mathematical expression depends on transition rates (hazard rates from one state to another) in a Markov chain (Ramlau-Hansen (1991), Norberg (1999))"
"Community of practice (CoP) is defined as a potential space for cooperation between peers favoring the access to knowledge and allowing the development of innovation. A CoP, which can also be seen as an informal network of cooperation, could be interesting for startups that suffering with the lack of resources and that are deficient in their innovation process, especially when they are far from potential innovation partners. However, the issue of competition cannot be disregarded in their inter-organizational context. Furthermore, the literature on communities of practice has not yet addressed this paradoxical dynamic in which there is presence at the same time of cooperation and competition logics. Moreover, the literature of coopetition does not well explore this kind of dynamics in informal networks. Thus, the goal of this thesis is to study the effect of coopetition on the social dynamics of inter-organizational CoPs in an innovation context. This study is based on an exploratory and longitudinal case study that was conducted at San Pedro Valley (Brazil), which is a CoP of innovative startups in the information technology sector.  The analysis of this case study allows us to construct a categorization of different relationships of coopetition that exist in the inter-organizational CoP.  Even if the participation of entrepreneurs, which are members of this informal network, allows the strategic adjustment of their companies in issues related to the innovation projects, some relations will progressively modify the crucial characteristics of the CoP due to the forthcoming of tensions and conflicts.  One of the main results of this thesis is a new light at the functioning of CoP at the inter-organizational level showing how the coopetition strategies is developed in informal networks. Another result includes an individual-level to understand the drivers of coopetition, and then the study provides insights about the informal relationship in the scope of coopetition strategy.  It is also worth mentioning methodological contributions based on the use of a ""netnography"" approach to entrepreneurial social networks, as well as managerial contributions to entrepreneurs, allowing a better understanding of their innovation ecosystem."
"This thesis aims at contributing to make the energy renovation market long-lasting and self-sustaining. To achieve this, our objective is to quantify the risk of not achieving energy performance after renovation. First, we analyze households’ psychological factors that should be considered to improve energy consumption prediction models. Drawing on the Je rénove BBC program, we highlight four cognitive biases that negatively impact the difference between actual and predicted energy consumption. We then study the most appropriate contract structures improving the flow and quality of renovation projects, encouraging craftsmen to work better. On one hand, we determine optimal contracts for an Agent who has to perform two tasks and underestimates the impact of one of them on the building's performance. On the other hand, we test individual-based and group-based incentives on the ability of several real Agents (craftsmen) to coordinate, according to their initial training (DORéMI, …)."

"For 10 years, the concepts of "" service "" and "" service's relations "" are more and more important in industry, administration and services. All these organizations try to put the client ot the use or the client at the center of their organisationnal process, giving a new status to the organization centered on the client. These organizations are particularly intersted in the development of service's relations which are now central in their strategy of development. We have studied this evolution in two companies : the french assurance company ASSUR and the transport company of metro in Paris, the RATP. They both take care about the adaptation of their offer to the needs and expectations of their clients, about the quality of prestations and services, and about the personnalization of their relations with the clients. This new strategic orientation involves a modification of the situations and conditions of work which require from the employees to developp new competences, new attitudes, new professionnal culture and new professionnal practices centered on the service offered to the client. The aim of this comparative work is to identify and analyse the consequences of these strategies centered on the client on work's organization, on the nature of the work of the employees in direct contact with clients, and on social relationships. We have focused our analysis on the issues that the employees are daily meeting in their direct relations with clients. These two compagnies have tried to supplemente to their old industrial logic with a new servicial logic of production. They actually have failed because of many reasons essentially due to organisation of work, to power relationships, to managerial presupposes (seen as evidences), to the lack of reflexivity and to the ideological dimension of these projects.

"Trust exists when a person relies on the actions of an other person who is considered capable of meeting theirs expectations, and who acts voluntarily to this effect without abusing the situation. Thus, trust may facilitate opportunist behaviour. This theory statement allows us to respond to the following question : Can trust be viewed as a social control mechanism and a mechanism which makes opportunist behaviour easier ? In order to study this question, empirical data has been collected in three consultancy firms. The principal results of the study are the following : - Members are all the more obliged to engage in vertical trust relationships when the organisation context is of a threatening nature. - As a social mechanism, trust is effective as it limits use of authority and rules to maintain coordination between actors. As a psychological mechanism, trust is efficient as it encouraging consultants to work harder."
"This research focuses on the hard core members of brand communities in order to apprehend their role inside and outside the community. It studies seven cases chosen for their theoretical representation. Data are collected thanks to a (n)ethnographic method and analyzed following a discourse analysis inspired framework. This research shows that hard core members are the necessary actors for the emergence of a brand community. They organize the community, distribute the collective tasks and control the communitarian interactions. Hard core members are the appropriate spokespersons of the brand community. They try to enroll new members and to convert the users of other brands. They maintain relationships with the firm owning the brand as well as with other firms. Hard core members get in touch with other stakeholders not linked to the brand but also part of the market."
"Road transportation, which has become a dominant mode for goods and passengers transportation, raises major social and environmental issues. Consequently, public policies encourage alternatives transport modes, especially railway and inland water transportations, by weighty infrastructures investments (such as Seine-North Europe canal project). In spite of these policies, the road transportation trend has not yet been reversed; this suggests that other measures to trigger a modal shift should be found. This PhD thesis deals with the modal shift toward the inland water transportation of goods. Evolutionary economics approach considers that Transport and Logistics Organizations (TLOs) shape themselves around a common goal (delivering the goods) and specific knowledge. In consequence, the main hypothesis is that the modal shift from road to inland water transportation assumes a TLO’s knowledge evolution within an organizational learning framework. This organizational learning should be matched by radical changes in order to make inland water transportation TLOs long-lasting and efficient. Besides, institutional economics enlightens the selection mechanisms of this knowledge, and allows considering in fine how public authorities could support this efficient learning. The analysis is based on semi-structured interviews with members of various TLOs which have been chosen, on the one hand, in the agribusiness sector which encompasses the most important users of water transportation means and, on the other hand, in other sectors which have been tried (with success or not) to convert the road transportation TLO into the inland water transportation TLO."
"This dissertation addresses the effects of modes of regulation relying on intermediaries in order to promote soft organizational frameworks. For that purpose, I analyze a case of intermediation taking place in the French healthcare field : the participation of the National Agency for the Performance of Healthcare Facilities (NAPHF) in the outpatient shift programmed by the 2015-2017 Transformation Plan of the healthcare system. My approach, which draws on the work of Michel Foucault, consists in examining the regime of governmentality that has been implemented in that case. Having used that inductive approach during a three-year research intervention in partnership with the NAPHF, I unveil the specific features that have enabled the regulatory regime of the Transformation Plan to operate at the national, regional and intra-hospital levels. Furthermore, that approach leads beyond measuring the efficacy of intermediation to explaining its effectiveness and to questioning its usefulness for answering the needs of the different stakeholders of the healthcare system. As a whole, this doctoral thesis bears methodological, theoretical, and practical implications. On the methodological side, I propose a method for evaluating the effects of regulatory tools aimed at fostering organizational change. On the theoretical side, I supplement existing models for understanding intermediation by identifying three effects of that organizational activity, which is currently expanding. Those effect are namely: contingent capacity-building, conjoined truth-telling, and alethurgic learning. On the practical side, my work suggests that management scholars may use the conceptual apparatus inherited from Michel Foucault in a constructive manner. I illustrate the potential benefits of that constructive stance by providing six recommendations for improving the regulation of the French healthcare system as well as five possible orientations for researchers who are seeking to help the actors of that system in the future."
"While affirming the vital need for technical, economic and social breaks, their conditions of emergence and institutionalization in large companies still remained an object of fundamental research and many questions were still open : what design engineering to face intensive innovation ? What organization should be put in place to professionalize the disruptive processes and integrate them into the strategic agenda ? What model of institutionalization is compatible with this new regime of the firm ? Based on many works spread over more than a decade, in large public transport companies, this thesis shows that the institutionalization of breakthrough innovation is built and analyzed according to a model with three complementary dimensions : the industrialization of innovative design methods, the metabolization of professionalized actors and the governance of intensive innovation. In addition, this model highlights the endogenous process of piloting intensive innovation that is at the heart of this institutionalization. It begins with the routinisation of collaborative innovation devices (KCP) in the form of ""laboratories / networks"". Demonstrated in a repetitive way, the generative power of these devices gives credibility to new innovative domains, as well as the multiple actors involved. Then emerges a transversal organization (Innovation Intensive function) that capitalizes on new collective metabolism: breakthrough innovation then integrates, with its benchmarks and resources, into the daily activity of the company. On these bases, a real ""design"" governance, adapted to breakthrough innovation, is then made possible. Thus, the institutionalization of disruptive innovation mobilizes classic forms of institutionalization, but it also distances itself from it by its necessary coupling to the strong cognitive generativity that the rupture requires. Ultimately, this model refers in a certain way to the emergence of the modern enterprise itself, when it has institutionalized scientific research."

"Private equity seems to play a key role in firms’ growth. However, the relationship between investment and growth remains poorly understood. Moreover, in recent years, doubts have arisen regarding the correlation between financial valuation and firms’ long-term and virtuous development - especially for mature firms. With a focus on French medium-sized companies (“ETI”), this thesis shows that a specific kind of private equity - that we propose to call “regeneration capital”- could be better conceptualized in order to support firms’ sustainable economic growth and to empower public policy with respect to corporate funding. Regeneration capital, unlike usual private equity asset class, is less related to the firm’s life cycle stage than to the nature of targeted growth. Rather than increasing the performance of existing products, this type of growth emerges from another growth dynamic, that we call “generative growth”, which results from the regeneration of the firm’s products and resources. Based on an analysis of the financial needs of medium-sized companies, as well as on an in-depth case study of medium-sized firms extracted from Bpifrance's investment portfolio, the thesis demonstrates that the growth shortage of medium-sized firms is not due to an equity gap. Empirical evidence rather suggests a lack of valuation of generative growth by traditional investment models. Drawing on existing data, the thesis hence investigates how investors’ financial analysis can be enhanced by integrating an assessment of firms’ innovation capabilities and of the return promises of yet unknown product to be developed. We then discuss the principles but also the risks and prerequisites of regeneration capital. This model not only explains part of medium-sized firms’ difficulties to grow but opens new perspectives on the relationship between corporate finance and design theories."
"Islamic finance has grown steadily for three decades now. The research question consists inchecking whether the existence of specific standards of financial accounting for Islamicfinancial institutions can be a hindrance to the goal of international accounting harmonization undertaken over the last forty years with the creation of the IASC. A first normative phase of research suggests that accounting values resulting from Islamic moral are incompatible with the accounting values of International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS / IFRS). However, a second descriptive and comparative phase confirms the convergence of Islamic Financial Accounting Standards (IFAS) to IAS / IFRS illustrating a ""schizophrenic"" behavior of the Islamic accounting standard-setting body (AAOIFI). Indeed, this organization sets up standards in compliance with Islamic jurisprudence for accounting presentation rules but that are converged with IAS / IFRS for valuation rules, while highlighting the ""relational communication"" of accounting data. To study the factors of this convergence, we take in a third explanatory phase, a dual theoretical approach (neo-institutional sociology and theory of sacred-profane dichotomy) and perform some interviews with members of two operational committees of AAOIFI: the Shariah Board and the Accounting Board (AASB). Thus, the accounting convergence is explained by the mimicry of Islamic banks and Islamic accounting standard-setting body that adopt the same thoughts and behaviors than conventional banks and the International Financial Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  Similarly, ""professional struggles"" between the two operational committees of AAOIFI lead to the domination of the accounting committee members that are more influenced by an ""IFRS culture"" while directing some decisions of standard-setting process towards greater convergence of IFAS to the IASIFRS.Thus, conflicts between professional jurisdictions with ill-defined borders allow theestablishment of a scale of power and facilitate the conduct of mimetic, coercive andnormative isomorphism."
"This thesis is aimed at developing a static computable general equilibrium model of the french economy, with an emphasis on the agricultural and food processing sectors. So far research has concentrated on the effects of policy changes on agriculture and/or parts of the food processing industries only ; the general equilibrium approach allows to consider the french food complex in its global economic environment. Three characteristics of the developed model may be underlined : the high level of disaggregation of the various stages of the food complex, the representation of production technologies and consumer preferences, the explicit modelling of the agricultural policy instruments. The model is used to analyse a great variety of agricultural policy scenarios and provides useful results for agricultural policy makers. "

"In this thesis we analyse a problem of the real economic adjustment between two countries, one of which is an emerging market and the other is a developed economy. When they form a monetary union the only possible adjustment to asymmetric shocks transmitted internationally is through the real variables. We take into account existing asymmetries in the foreign direct investment (FDI) intensity and FDI relations. The issues of FDI and differences in the FDI intensity are real aspects of functioning of economies and relations between them. They reveal some problem from the macroeconomic perspective. However, the problem relates also to microeconomic foundations. The given trade and FDI relations between countries depend on decisions of firms that are heterogeneous. To study the effect of plant delocalization and FDI on output fluctuations between two countries we use a framework that accounts for all this issues, that means dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with heterogeneity in firm productivity. We add a new dimension to the existing literature on DSGE models with heterogeneous firms. First, we complete goods market with a new segment of production, namely products offered by multinationals which produce abroad and export back to their economy of origin. Second, we account for asymmetries in the FDI intensity and differences in production structures that occur between two economies forming a monetary union. Summing things up, the analysis allows us to state that  the real aspects of economy functioning, such as trade connections between countries and differences in production structures, determine economic performance and behaviour of economies in  terms of output fluctuations."
"This PH.D thesis focuses on the contribution of sophisticated investors, i.e. hedge funds, in the dynamics of financial markets. Considering that they are key players in the price discovery and market liquidity, regarding the standard model or the behavioral critics, it provides an assessment of dynamic interdependencies between alternative management strategies and financial markets.The first three chapters put into perspective, through original econometric approaches, hedge funds strategies with market dynamics through the study of returns , volatility and co-volatilities. Based on a wide range of results, the study reveals the many causalities between funds and markets offering to the behavioral finance elements of empirical evidence of the interactions described interms of excess volatility or financial contagion. Rich in these teachings, the last chapter finally proposes a return to theoretical models of market equilibria in order to provide a mixed picture of rational speculation in its relation to market efficency."
"This thesis highlights the macroeconomic aspect of the exchange rate pass-through to domestic prices in the euro area countries. We use a wide range of up-to-date econometric methods in order to provide robust measures of the rate of pass-through as well as to shed further light on its macro determinants. The main finding of our research is the prominent role of macroeconomic forces in driving the recent declin of the transmission of currency movements. A direct consequence of this result is that the lowering in the rate of pass-through is not necessarily a structural phenomenon and it may be solved via macroeconomic policies. For instance, the shift to a more stable monetary policy conditions with credible and anti-inflationary regime would reduce the sensibility of prices to exchange rate changes. This is especially true for countries with historically poor macroeconomic policies. Thus, a better macroeconomic management with a sounder set of policies within the EMU may be an effective tool for reducing the degree of pass-through"
"In highly competitive markets, shopping prescription may be strategic for organizations. In complex decision-making situations, shopping prescription is useful for some consumers. Literature review reveals gaps, contradictions and field shortcomings about this concept. What brand prescription is? What is its weight among the main decision-making characteristics? What is the impact of culture? A qualitative study conducted in France with 10 vet prescribers and 10 pet food buyers helps to better define this concept, and validate or reject previous contributions to this topic. Using the Consumer Styles Inventory (Sproles et Kendall 1986), a quantitative survey with 308 french and 221 chinese pet food buyers validates prescription consciousness as a fundamental decision-making characteristic. It has a moderate weight within the main decision-making style, but its role is discriminant on the cluster formation in France. It is positiveley and significantly associated with perfectionism, loyalty, hedonism and confusion while it is negatively and sinificantly to price. There is a significant difference in decision-making styles between French and Chinese, but this is not true for prescription consciousness. The main theoretical and methodological contributions are a better definition of this concept, its measurement scale and its presence in both but divergent cultures. From a managerial standpoint, this research highlights the added value brought by prescribers. Companies positioned on the high end market are encouraged to set up prescribers networks to ease sales. A series of operational recommendations arise from there."
"The aim of this thesis is to explicitly introduce the decision-maker into the empirical analysis of different political processes in the French context. Three cases are successively analyzed,each raising a specific problematic. The first chapter focuses on French municipalities. A new original dataset, covering mayors of municipalities of more than 10,000 inhabitants over the period 2000-2012, underpins the study. The objective is to investigate to what extentthe mayor’s personal influence on the investment policy affects his/her reelection probability. Results show that this information plays a significant role only in small municipalities. Chapter twostudies the French legislative production, exploiting another original dataset. A dual cycle of the production of laws emerges, connected to both the presidential and the legislative elections. A link between government members’ personal characteristics and legislative output is established. Finally, chapter three investigates the relationship between electoral competition and political selection. A third important dataset providing data about the individual parliamentary work of the deputies over the period 1958-2012 allows such an analysis. Resultsindicate that deputies elected in contested districts have a higher overall productivity. The intensity of the relationship reached its peak in the 1980’s, but is continuously decreasing since then."
"This dissertation consists of three essays on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity of banks and various dimensions of their stability. The first essay delves upon whether and how acquisitiveness of large European banks over an extensive period of 1990-2006 relate to their bailouts and credit ratings during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Three important findings emerge from the performed analysis. First, the intensity of bank M&A activity positively relates to the likelihood and extent of their bailout support during the financial crisis. Second, the ex-ante acquisitiveness of banks relates in a significantly positive manner with the deterioration in bank issuer ratings – suggesting towards higher default risk of acquisitive banks during the crisis period. Third, a positive link between the external support and the joint effect of M&A activity and “too big to fail” factor substantiates that banks may pursue M&A activity to exploit safety net benefits associated with “too big to fail” status in the market. The second chapter analyzes the relation between M&A activity of large European banks and their vulnerability to the financial crisis using Merton (1974) based distance to default (DD) and the Z-score ratio as a measure of bankruptcy risk and solvency. The results suggest that a greater focus of samples banks towards acquiring investment banking operations over a time span of 1990-2006 significantly relates to the increase in their risk default (measured by DD) and insolvency (measured by Z-score) during the recent financial crisis. Moreover, relatively limited evidence indicates towards the positive stability effects of the acquisitions performed in the retail banking segment of industry by the sample banks. The third and final essay of this dissertation provides M&A centric evidence on bank deregulation, consolidation, and stability in the U.S. banking industry. We primarily analyze the effects of two significant deregulatory acts of the 1990s that permitted U.S. banks to expand across states (the Riegle-Neal act of 1994) and functions performed (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act of 1999). We employ difference-in-difference approach over M&A activity of U.S. (treatment group) and European (control group) banks over a time span of 1990-2009 in an unbalanced panel setting. We find a significantly positive effect of deregulation in spurring M&A centric consolidation in the U.S. banking industry. However, such effects are not fully reflected in the types of diversification aimed at in the two deregulatory acts. Moreover, we also show that M&A intensity and deregulation jointly cast a negative effect on the stability of U.S. banking industry –thus substantiating “Concentration – Fragility” view over banking."
"Retail cooperatives and independent associated retail networks are groups of retailers, owners of retail and service stores that pool their means (in terms of purchasing, marketing, communication, funding, logistics, etc.) and develop common policies. The objective of this research is to demonstrate how retail cooperatives and independent associated networks, whose cooperators with their double status, as both customers and co-owners of the cooperative, can generate synergies as efficiently as in plural form networks (coexistence of company and franchise units in the same network) in order to face the challenge of network uniformity and thus both grow and survive as does every other kind of network. In this research, we will focus on network uniformity. Maintaining uniformity means respecting the core components of the network concept. A four-case study has been conducted and the findings of our qualitative research highlight the existence of different processes which emerge from a centralized top- down approach (Contracts, Incentives and Persuasion), a decentralized bottom-up, or horizontal approach (Trust, Organizational commitment and Informal control) and from a mixed approach (Solidarity, Mimesis and Enculturation). All of these processes were operationalized and tested empirically with a sample of 245 cooperators or independent associated retailers from 53 different networks, representing all the sectors of activity defined by the FCA (French Federation of Retail Cooperatives and Retail Independent Associations). The analysis was based on PLS structural equation modeling. This research suggests a model of management to face the challenge of concept uniformity at the heart of retail cooperatives and independent associated networks. This subject is of great interest to all retail cooperative networks. Maintaining uniformity can help to reinforce a network’s image as an indicator and guarantee for consumers and cooperative candidates. It will differentiate them from their competitors, contribute to improving better purchasing conditions and thus achieving important cost reductions, as well as avoiding opportunistic behaviors that can harm a network’s performance."
"Global climate is warming, and the effects of climate change are associated with a lot of uncertainty. Not only average temperatures are expected to rise, but also the occurrence of extreme events such as floods or droughts. Agriculture is particularly at risk, due to the importance of weather conditions in production. This thesis therefore aims at investigating the relationship between weather variations and agricultural production, to better assess the potential effects of climate change on agriculture, relying on both theoretical and empirical methods. The first two chapters focus on developing countries and provide two empirical studies based on Indian data at the individual farm level that link climate to agricultural production and profits and to consumption decisions. We find contrasted results, with an overall damaging effect of climate change scenarios on Indian agricultural production and profits, especially for farmers in southern India. Irrigation may however help mitigating the losses, as well as crop mixing, particularly for small farms. The last two chapters consider developed countries. The first step focuses on crop yields in Europe. Under the tested climate scenarios, wheat yields are projected to slightly increase by the end of the 21$^\textrm{st}$ century relative to the observed yields from the past 25 years. These small gains are however accompanied by a lot of regional heterogeneity. For European corn yields, the projections highlight small gains in by the middle of the 21$^\textrm{st}$ century, followed by relatively higher losses in the long run. The second step relies on a general equilibrium approach, and aims at investigating the short-run impacts of weather shocks on business cycles, through their damaging effects on agriculture. Increasing the variance of climate shocks in accordance with forthcoming climate change leads to a sizeable increase in the volatility of key macroeconomic variables, such as production and inflation."
"This thesis examines the specific role of volatility risks and co-volatility in the formation of long-term interest rates in the euro area. In particular, a two-country theoretical portfolio choice model is proposed to evaluate the volatility risk premia and their contribution to the contagion and flight to quality processes. This model also provides an opportunity to analyze the ECB's role of asset purchases (QE) on the equilibrium of bond markets. Our empirical tests suggest that the ECB's QE programs from March 2015 have accelerated the ""defragmentation"" of the euro zone bond markets."
"Some executives, facing an economical and managerial system that doesn’t suit them anymore, chose to leave their position in a structure to become coaches. Beyond the managerial norms of career change, we explain that it is a turning point. This change of career, within the Critical Management Studies movement, and with a Foucauldian power perspective,  is interpreted here as them reaching saturation point, due to the effects of subjectivation related to managerial governmentality. Those former executives, especially young and middle-aged managers, find themselves gaining a critical detachment. Furthermore, we notice a phenomenon of microemancipation through being coached … in the training of becoming a coach, by reappropriating the techniques of the care of the self. This research process involves Grounded Theory and life narratives. Firstly, we worked on phenomenological texts, then on an a posteriori coding by themes, and finally on a critical discourse analysis. Our resulting theoretical framework is anchored on a population of 25 former executives who have become coaches. It underlines a generic process with differences related to criteria such as gender, age when the career change happens, previous professional experience and position (manager or consultant)."
"The medico-social sector today produces a large number of management tools at the national ""state"" level  through the ANAP (National Support Agency for Performance) and ANESM (National Agency for the Assessment and Quality of Medico-social Services and Institutions) at the national ""sector"" level  through large associations and federations,  at the regional level by the supervisory authorities which  are the Regional Health Agencies, at the  level of head offices of associations, or on the ground within the Medico-Social Institutions and Services (ESMS).We study the future of this management tool at the operational level: within medico-social institutions and services (ESMS). More specifically, we study the management practices of directors of ESMS' in the field of disability belonging to administrative associations. The methodology used is twofold. A first qualitative approach allows us to identify the management tools that may be seen without ESMS', to draw up an inventory of the uses of these tools and to identify key explanatory and predictive factors of the variability of statutes for the adoption and use of tools. To do this, we focus on 32 semi-structured interviews of directors of medico-social institutions and services. A second quantitative approach which allows us to confirm the importance of the attitude of the individual towards the tool, and the perceived social norms characterizing the attitude vis-à-vis the management tool of stakeholders. The pervasiveness of attitudes emphasizes the importance of meaning (or schema) carried by the tool. Within this confirmatory stage we focus on 351 responses to a questionnaire sent to ESMS directors."
"The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the conduct of macroprudential policies in an heterogenous monetary union, such as the Eurozone, by borrowing on the very recent theoretical and empirical developments of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models and Bayesian econometrics. We account for two main patterns of the Eurosystem: the business cycles divergence between core and peripheral countries and the globalization of banking and its spillovers when implementing macroprudential policies. As a main result, the implementation of macroprudential policy measures improves welfare at the global level. The highest welfare gains are observed when countries use multiple instruments and when macroprudential policy is implemented in a granular fashion. However, the conduct of macroprudential policy is not a free lunch for participating countries: in most situations, peripheral countries are winners while core countries record either smaller welfare gains or even welfare losses. In many policy experiments, we find that there exists an equilibrium that combines welfare increases at both the global and national levels for all participants but its enforceability requires a federal action, thus justifying the existence of a coordination mechanism such as the ESRB in the Eurozone. Finally, the possibility of banks to engage in cross border lending introduces an important spillover channel that tends to increase the welfare gains associated to macroprudential measures. Ignoring this phenomenon may lead to fallacious results in terms of the welfare ranking of alternative implementation schemes."
"The objective of this thesis is to present four essays in behavioral and experimental economics on decision-making under risk and ambiguity. The first essay presents a synthesis and a point of view on the representativeness of experimental results regarding individual preferences: social preferences and risk and time preferences, in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The second essay explores experimentally the effect of risk and ambiguity on job search behavior in an infinite horizon. The results show that in risk and ambiguity, reservation wages are lower than the theoretical values and decrease during the search process. Similarly, subjects behave as ambiguity neutral agents. The third and fourth essay examine the effect of the social context and the correlation of payments on attitudes towards risk and ambiguity respectively in gain, loss and mixed domain. The results show that the introduction of the social context has a significant effect on attitudes towards risk in all three domains. Nevertheless, the correlation of risks has an effect on risk attitudes only in the mixed domain. As for ambiguity, ambiguity attitudes vary across domains. The correlation of payments decreases ambiguity aversion."
"Cameroon is an economy committed to an expansionist development strategy, yet faced with major economic growth challenges and chronic corruption. In this context. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to carry out a theoretical and empirical analysis of the effects of corruption on Cameroon's economic growth. The first analysis framework is aimed at determining the nature of causal relationship between corruption and economic growth in Cameroon. The estimations reveal that in long run, an increase in the level of corruption leads to a reduction in the rate of economic growth. This negative relationship is following a direct effect as well as indirect effects through private investment, education and public spending. The second axis of analysis seeks to assess the indirect effect of corruption on economic growth through distortions in the distribution of public expenditure. Our results show that corruption brings about distortions aimed at increasing allocations to public investment spending thereby producing an insignificant effect on economic growth on the one hand, and reducing the share of public recurrent expenditure with a negative effect on economic growth, on the other hand."
"This dissertation is to explore the risk factors and factor models on Chinese A-share stock market based on the context of Fama-French (FF) factor model. First of all, chapter 1 re-examines the applicability of Fama-French Three-Factor (FF3F) Model and the latest Fama-French Five-Factor (FF5F) Model considering several special features of Chinese stock market. FF3F Model can explain a majority of time-series variation of the Chinese A-share stock returns. The market beta and SMB are important determinants in explaining the cross-sectional variation in the average stock returns over the sample period; however, we find no value premium. Comparing the performance of both FF3F Model and FF5F Model on Chinese A-share stock market, in the presence of profitability and investment factors, FF5F Model seems not capture more variations of expected stock returns than the three-factor model except the six value-weighted portfolios formed on size and operating profitability.Chapter 2 examines whether FF factors SMB and HML proxy for the innovations of selected state variables (aggregate dividend yield, one-month T-bill rate, term spread and default spread) that describe future investment opportunities on Chinese A-share stock market during the research period. Both time-series and cross-sectional regressions are performed on five comparative models using Fama-MacBeth two-stage approach. FF factors don’t lose their explanatory power with or without the presence of the innovations of selected four state variables in both the time-series and cross-sectional examinations. We find that the information contained in innovation of aggregate dividend yields seems totally captured by the combination of market beta and size factor. FF factors might have played a limited role in capturing alternative investment opportunities proxied by innovations of the selected four state variables.Chapter 3 investigates whether FF factors proxy for distress risk factor and whether different methods of constructing factors result in the different outcomes. The empirical results suggest that there is no significant evidence that FF factors are proxying for distress risk on Chinese A-share stock market. Comparing the time-series regression results by using two different methods, the distress risk factor constructed based on DLI seems to perform slightly better than that constructed based on O-score in capturing time-series average returns. However, the distress risk factor is not an important determinant of cross-sectional average returns, and FF factors cannot proxy as distress risk factor in the cross-section on Chinese A-share stock market."
"This study investigates the main characteristics, development, social dimensions, benefits and the challenges of franchising in the education sector of Pakistan. Furthermore, it highlights that education franchising in Pakistan is mainly operating as a form of social franchising. The study also discusses how the social dimension of education franchising in Pakistan is counterbalanced with the commercial side of this business. A multi-perspective qualitative approach was adopted. This involved conducting and recording 44 in-depth interviews with franchisors, franchisees, school teachers, network employees, parents, students and government officials. Secondary data was collected from franchisor websites. Data was transcribed and analyzed by NVivo. The findings suggest a link between the emergence of social franchising and the performance of public sector educational institutions. Moreover, findings elaborate that education franchising networks in Pakistan have made a significant social contribution by increasing literacy rates and reducing gender inequalities. Therefore, it can be considered as a form of social franchising. Some characteristics of educational franchise networks in Pakistan are the same as those of franchising in more traditional sectors such as hotels and restaurants. Interestingly, the provision of brand name, transfer of know-how, assistance and training, as well as network uniformity, were found to be just as important as they are in traditional franchising sectors. The findings also suggest that users and public have a positive perception of franchising in the education sector and it is regarded as a better alternative as compared to other available options."
"The aim of this thesis is to measure the impact of international trade on growth and carbon dioxide emissions using a sample covering 83-104 countries over the period 1971-2010. The empirical analysis of the income and growth equation in the first chapter shows that the trade-growth relationship differs across regions. Especially in Africa, a continent characterized by a small network trade. The second chapter develops the results and examines the network analysis by taking into account the topological characteristic of a country in world network trade. The results show that the impact of trade on growth depends on the country's commercial network and that this impact increases with the extension of the network. In a second part, we analyze the directly and indirectly channels through which trade openness affect the environment. The analysis in the third chapter shows that the effect of trade on emissions of pollutants differs between developed and developing countries. The last chapter focuses on the effects of trade on pollutant emissions through trade specialization. According to the estimation results, for high-income countries, the effect of trade is greater if they specialize in capital-intensive sectors and decreases with an increase in per capita income. For middle- and low-income countries, trade has a positive effect on pollutant emissions, this effect is impeded if they specialize in labor-intensive industries and increase with an increase in per capita income."
"The aim of this thesis is to study if the debt of local governments is a threat to their fiscal health, by focusing on French and Canadian cases (mainly Québec and Ontario). The first chapter provides a descriptive analysis of the studied territories, and reveals that the local debt is significantly lower in Ontario, in comparison with France and Québec. The second chapter focuses on the fiscal health of the 30 largest French and Canadian cities. It shows that municipalities with a large debt are not always in a precarious financial situation. The third chapter investigates the hypothesis of a negative capitalization of municipal public debt in the average residential property values in 130 municipalities of Québec and Ontario. Our estimations give mixed results, and do not allow us to confirm our initial hypothesis beyond any doubt. Nevertheless, the household’s burden in Québec which have to finance larger municipal debts is offset by lower property prices and lower private indebtedness compared to Ontario’s households. Finally, the fourth chapter examines a French issue: the potential link between the integration level within intermunicipal community (EPCI and member municipalities) and the consolidated debt. Results show a negative effect of integration on the consolidated debt and on the debt of member municipalities, suggesting that a larger integration could be a complementary method to the legal restrictions of local indebtedness."
"The contribution of this thesis lies in the evaluation of the vulnerability of a number of voting rules to the violationof two properties of the theory of social choice. We rely on the axiomatic approach of social choice theory to examinethe behavior of a social choice procedure according to a value judgment (or axiom) emitted by the economist.Reversal symmetry is the first property studied. Following the works of Saari [150], we evaluate two families ofvoting by using this property as the decision criterion : the simple scoring rules on the one hand, and the scoringrules with runoff on the other hand. We do probability calculations to evaluate how frequent this phenomenon is,in the three-candidate case under universal domain as well as under a restricted domain, and we also tackle thefour-candidate case and the infinite number of voters case.The second topic is devoted to the study of the Dodgsonrule according to the homogeneity axiom. We introduce a simple and systematic method for the computation ofthe Dodgson score. We distinguish various classes of profiles at which that rule may be vulnerable to this property.Further, frequencies of violation of this property by the Dodgson rule are provided."
"This thesis explains and clarifies the ways in which responsible performance can increase financial performance for investors. Based on data gathered between 1992 and 2012 and a state-of-the-art KLD scoring system, we demonstrate that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) does not consistently increase the performance of a share portfolio. CSR, when proactively implemented, proves to be a cost granted by investors concerned about their ethical models. Depending on the sector observed, restrictions on irresponsible acts can however improve financial performance. Our research highlights the importance of selecting portfolio assets beforehand. We found that CSR strategies improve financial performance provided that some criteria which restrict managerial opportunism. Our multi-criteria analysis revealed that the expenditure of responsibility is a result of excess cash flow. The weighted average cost of the debt will determine the effectiveness of these strategies on the company's profitability. Finally, we highlight discrepancies in Corporate Social Responsibility reports, according to the ethical level and financial performance of each company. These lexical fields inform the investor of managers’ intentions and hence, allow a better selection of the assets."
"While the majority of studies obtain positive impacts of public infrastructure on economic activity, the problem between public spending and good resource allocation remains.This empirical thesis presents an unpublished work for Mauritania and is limited to three types of infrastructure.First, we study the relationship between the evolution of the total road stock and the per capita GDP through a Coob-Douglas production function.Our main result is that the road stock in Mauritania has impacted the GDP per capita in a positive and significant way.Second, we analyze the contribution of health capital to economic growth. In estimating several models, three main results emerge: 1) The level of public health spending has no significant effect on the growth of life expectancy, but appears to have positive impacts on the reduction of gross mortality per 1000 people. 2) Public expenditure on health has a positive effect on overall GDP, but this effect becomes insignificant when it comes to GDP per capita.3) Initial life expectancy and its growth have positive and significant effects on GDP per capita.Finally, we explore the impact of ICT on economic growth.By studying a production function and a VAR model, we show that ICT capital and the evolution of fixed telephone subscribers have significantly stimulated economic activity."
"Since the rise in food prices in 2007-2008, agriculture is again at the front of the international scene. Political and human consequences of the turmoil in international markets have been significant in many countries and some had their government overthrown. In this context, we focus on rice, a cereal that guarantees the minimum caloric intake for more than 50% of the population, and on the rice farmer, the first link in the production chain. First we review the history of rice culture, the recent market developments and the rice crisis of 2007-2008. Secondly we are interested specifically in the transmission of international prices to producer prices, then we try to understand, from a macroeconomic and microeconomic point of view, the productive behavior of rice farmers in the variation of the price they get."
"This dissertation is interested in the long-run relationship between longevity and economic development. In the ﬁrst chapter, I analyse the impact of health expenditures on economic growth and welfare. For this, I study the inﬂuence of the tax rate in an economy à la Chakraborty (2004). I ﬁrst determine the growth-maximizing tax rate, which is shown to be 0 in low-income countries. Second, I show that the steady-state income level is an inverted U-shaped function or a decreasing function of the tax rate. Third, I study the tax rate that maximizes the steady-state welfare level. In the second chapter, I propose a theoretical model to study the growth impacts of health expenditures chosen by the agents. Indeed, I develop a Diamond model with endogenous growth in which young individuals can spend resources to increase their longevity in retirement period. I give a full characterization of the dynamic general equilibrium and determine the growth impacts of health expenditures. They can speed up or slow down economic growth. They can be a barrier or a necessity for growth to take place. A calibration to OECD countries suggests that the latter case is the most likely one. Finally, the third chapter studies the theoretical impact of the aging process on the sectorial labor allocation. To this aim, I develop a multi-sector two-period overlapping generations model in which I examine the consequences of both a longevity shift and a fertility shift on the labor allocation of the economy and on the income per worker level. I show that contrary to one-sector models, the income per worker level is not necessarily monotonic with respect to demographic variables. Realistic demographic shocks are also shown to create signiﬁcant labor reallocation across sectors."
"Organization and Management studies have somewhat neglected Time Perspective (TP), which is, according to Lewin, the sum of the individual’s viewpoints of his psychological past and future existing at a given time. This dissertation examines how small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) owner-managers and their firms generate growth, with a focus on TP. Questionnaires and qualitative interviews with 22 SME owners (10‒49 employees) revealed individual TPs and links among diverse components of the conceptual framework (e.g., alertness, entrepreneurial orientation) and other important factors (e.g., cognitive biases). The 22 cognitive maps also showed several firm growth trajectories and raised questions about the “balanced” TP as a discriminating criterion. Last, a model and directions for future research are proposed."
"Many types of strategic decisions result in recurring, systematic errors. Extant theories of organizations are insufficient to account for this phenomenon. Behavioral Strategy suggests that an explanation may be found in the psychology of decision makers, and particularly in their cognitive biases. This, however, calls for a link between individual-level cognition and affects, and organization-level choices. We propose “Strategic Choice Routines” as a middle level of analysis to bridge this gap, and identify three broad types of Strategic Choice Routines.This leads us to formulate hypotheses on how Strategic Choice Routines can be modified to minimize strategic errors. We illustrate these hypotheses through case studies; test some of them quantitatively; and analyze preferences that drive their adoption by executives. Finally, we discuss theoretical and managerial implications."
"This thesis analyzes if and to what extent debt markets value the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of firms and sovereigns. The first chapter shows that negative ESG news has a negative impact on the cost of debt of firms. The news relates to environmental and social events within the industrial/utilities sector. In this sector, a sound corporate social performance acts as an insurance against the adverse impact of negative environmental events on bond prices. The second chapter reveals that ESG scores integrated into portfolios do not change the financial performance ex post. A portfolio manager can increase the average ESG rating of her portfolio by 1.5 standard deviations without incurring cost. This leaves substantial room and opportunity for ESG ratings to be combined with asset allocation or absolute return strategies. The third chapter shows how ESG performance is linked to a lower cost of debt of emerging sovereigns. Research indicates that an emerging country’s average cost of capital decreases with its positive environmental and social performance. The fourth chapter discusses how governance performance may influence the spread of debt denominated in local and foreign currency. In developed countries, the spread between a foreign currency yield and a hedged local currency yield increases with our political risk indicator, i.e. the foreign yield increases faster than the domestic one. For emerging countries, the reverse trend is true. Interestingly, the foreign currency and local currency yield spreads move significantly stronger in absolute terms with increasing foreign investment participation in both emerging countries and developed countries’ debt markets."
"In France, since early 2000s spreads a literature inviting professionals in contact with people suffering from Alzheimer disease to ""personalize"" the way they take care of them. This term refers to a humanization that seems to fade away in this particular context. What is asked to medical and paramedical staff, is a true and authentic commitment toward these patients. What is aimed, is a control of emotions and the way they are expressed.This Ph.D explores the way in which ""personalization"" is practically accomplished in the context of Alzheimer’s Special Care Units. Based on interviews and observations, it shows the banality of ""commitment"", and also the complexity of it’s execution. From the ethics of care perspective, an invisible work makes life possible for every protagonist living in that kind of environment. This cleverness of the situation drives away the danger of reification, and prevents burnout.Far from the chimerical ""professional distance"", this field work shows an articulation between commitment and detachment (Elias, 1956). Emotions appears to be a necessity in order to carry out the tasks, but also a danger that requires to be put away. Thus, Alzheimer’s units are characterized by the relative importance of autonomous regulation, in comparison with control regulation (Reynaud, 2004) : formalization process struggle due to the elusive and local nature of the ethics of care."
"Uncertainty is immanent in every innovation. Uncertainty about environmental and health risks that surround nanotechnology raises the questions of innovation success. Due in part to a lack of consistent data, there is limited empirical literature on determinants of the diffusion of nanotechnology. As part of a research program on nanotechnology, this research aims to investigate determinants of uptake of innovation in a situation of uncertainty about environmental and health risks. With this goal, as a first step, this work seeks to provide better understanding of the diffusion of a product that has been on the market for a long time. We have chosen a chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), because of the lack of historical data on nanomaterials. As a second step, we compare the results of the BPA study to nanosilver. We apply different econometric methods to gain insights into the relationship between consumption, economic growth, new scientific knowledge about risk and other variables using the data on BPA. The results illustrate a set of factors that influences the consumption of BPA at international level. The comparative study between BPA and nanosilver helps to refine the interpretation of main results and to obtain additional insights into the determinants of uptake of nanosilver. An explanatory analysis sheds light on the actions that different stakeholders undertake in response to new scientific knowledge about risk and deepens our understanding of “nanoresponsible development”.Keywords: Innovation, diffusion of innovation, product life cycle, nanotechnology, bisphenol A, risk, uncertainty, environment, health, precautionary principle, Safer by Design, responsible development"
"This thesis examines the role of firms´ heterogeneity in the Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) strategies. We already know firms’ heterogeneity to sharply distinguish between domestic firms, exporters and multinationals (MNEs). Yet, to what extent it impacts their foreign direct investments (FDIs) strategies among MNEs is rarely evoked, while several entry mode choices and FDI motives coexist. Mixing both theoretical and empirical innovating approaches using French firm-level data, the four chapters of this PhD dissertation reveal that the firm heterogeneity influences all of the three dimensions of strategies we review: foreign ownership mode, FDI motive and structure of the overall network of affiliates. Specifically, firm-level productivity and international experience foster deeper integration with a changing relative importance according to the host country. They are also associated with production motives and vertical integration into the global value chains. The more productive firms also display original affiliates’ network structure. These findings allow a better understanding of multinationals’ choices underneath the ``complex’’ global picture of FDI flows"
"A well-worked theory of macro-based investment decision is introduced. The theoretical influence of economic cycles on time-varying risk premiums is explained and exhibited. The importance of the turning points of the growth cycle, better known as the output gap, is outlined. To quickly and accurately detect economic turning points, probabilistic indicators are first created from a simple and transparent machine-learning algorithm known as Learning Vector Quantization. Those indicators are robust, interpretable and preserve economic consistency. A more complex approach is then evaluated: ensemble machine learning algorithms, referred to as random forest and as boosting, are applied. The two key features of those algorithms are their abilities to entertain a large number of predictors and to perform estimation and variable selection simultaneously. With both approaches investment strategies based on the models achieve impressive risk-adjusted returns: timing the market is thus possible. At last, exploring a new way of capital allocation, a hierarchical clustering based asset allocation method is introduced. The empirical results indicate that hierarchical clustering based portfolios are robust, truly diversified and achieve statistically better risk-adjusted performances than commonly used portfolio optimization techniques."
"This dissertation studies the role of financial investors on commodity markets, which is referred as financialization of commodity. The content of the dissertation splits to theoretical and empirical work. The implemented researches are motivated by the participation of investors, who own stock portfolios, in commodity futures markets for diversification reasons. Furthermore, that diversification is likely achieved by investing in a basket of commodities. The first chapter investigates, theoretically, the interaction between commodity and stock markets. The second chapter studies, empirically, the impact of financial investors on the commodities futures risk premium. It focuses on studying three commodities: crude oil (WTI), heating oil and natural gas. The third chapter examines, theoretically, the integration between two commodity markets. We clarify the hesitating of the previous literature in finding evidences of the impact of financialization. We confirm the influential power of investment in commodity market. However, that depends on the financial investors positions taken in the futures market. Generally, financialization increases the spot prices, the futures prices and inventory levels. We find, also, that investors are a transmission channel between commodity markets. Their effects spread out restricted to the cross commodity markets correlation. Finally, stock market returns became effective determinant of the futures risk premium after 2008 financial crisis. Also, the effect of the stock returns indifferent between short and long maturities."
"Emissions Trading Systems (ETSs) are an important instsrument in regulating pollution and have a key role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. This dissertation has a twin focus: spatial linkages between ETSs at a point in time and intertemporal trading within an ETS.Linkages between ETSs are crucial for cost-effectiveness of the future climate policy architecture. Complete linkages, however, are difficult to agree and to date, few and far between. Here, our contribution is twofold. First, using a simple and unified model and drawing on experiences with real-world ETSs, we compare alternative trade restrictions on bilateral linkages in facilitating the transition to an unrestricted link. Second, we provide a general model to describe and analytically characterize the effects and gains from multilateral linkages under uncertainty. The model is then calibrated to historical emissions of real-world jurisdictions to illustrate the determinants of linkage preferences.ETSs are subject to regulatory uncertainty, which can disrupt dynamic cost-effectiveness and undermine their long-term price signal. The prevalence of regulatory uncertainty can be assimilated to a situation of ambiguity. Here, our contribution is to analyze regulated entities’ intertemporal decisions under ambiguity aversion, characterize the induced distortions in market functioning, and discuss how these can help explain observations from existing ETSs."
"Considering issues regarding developing countries as the resource scarcity or social inequalities, infrastructural problems, and in vogue institutions, among others, it is recognizes that there is a wide open field to be explored and it is also a big locus of research with high social transformation potential. Thus in order to understand such problematics and the possibilities of transformation, new approaches are needed, as well as new organizational forms and new mechanisms to be engendered to address such changes, through the development of new practices, different from the traditional ones already practiced in developed countries. Thus considering the developing country scenario, there are huge differences and needs to focus initiatives and practices, according to the specific characteristics of such environment. It is not possible to consider with the same analytical lens, theories and tools used to understand the institutional context in developed countries. Although it is important to regard that both contexts present problems, but the nature and type of problems are very diverse. In this way it is possible to understand that it is in the urban scenario in developing countries that new practices are being developed to transform it somehow, being alternative forms to public r private initiatives (major social responsibility actions). The main aim of this research is thus to understand new transformation practices of the urban space in developing countries as a complex and nonlinear institutionalization process. In order to achieve this aim, two theoretical streams were explored that are neoinstitutional theory and more specifically institutionalization approaches. And the second theoretical approach is the activity theory, inside the spectrum of practice approaches, it is used in this research as a theoretical and analytical tool to embrace the growing complexity of the institutionalization processes as this of the urban space transformation through the development of micro practices. In order to surpass traditional institutionalization frameworks that considers the process as linear and deterministic, it is also possible to consider that there is no existing general framework in literature that guides researchers to a deep understanding of all the intrinsic complexity in institutionalization processes and its different elements. In this context, the aim of this research is to develop a more structured theoretic and analytic framework able to encompass all the elements, collectivity, non-linearity and complexity of the institutionalization process with the presentation of the activity system. Moreover, the concept of micro urban practices is developed in this research in order to achieve and specify the empiric field. This concept specifies activities developed with little resources and low cost, and deployed by civil society agents in a collaborative way in search for transformation of a specific urban space or even for the transformation of people’s engagement with the city and the space they live in. Finally, a few contributions could be developed in this research. The first one considers the deployment of the activity theory as a theoretical and analytical tool to encompass the inherent complexity of the institutionalization process that were not yet explored in the literature (until the moment). Another contribution concerns the innovative character of the studied organizations. This research is composed of two case studies of civil society and bottom up organizations that are focused in solving structural problems in Brazil through the development of micro practices."
"Little research look at failures of international projects, especially over a period of several years, from the original decision to country departure, after a two years’ presence. Based on analysis of the existing literature on company internationalization and intercultural management, we examine the Russian deployment of a middle-size automotive subcontractor, for whom the project was strategic. Our aim is to identify, understand and evaluate the impact of the different factors, which led to the failure, using interviews of the Western and Russian participants, documents issued during the preparation phase, as well as interviews of managers of automotive companies well established in Russia.  We show that despite strong personal investment, the team was not able to respond to the numerous constraints of the Russian market because of a lack of efficient cooperation with their Russian colleagues and partners. We conclude with a certain number of major considerations and advice to face similar projects more efficiently."
"Despite the wide literature on the consequences of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) use, the literature still lacks understanding about the societal consequences, positive or negative, intended or unintended. Consequences of technology usages on society are paradoxical. The paradoxical outcomes can be threat to the sustainability of society. Because interactions spread beyond the online space and its outcomes are paradoxical, societal challenges are complex problem. To harvest society, we need a better understanding of social complex problems. To do so, we adopted a multi-study dissertation model. The three studies of this doctoral work adopt a qualitative approach and a critical realist philosophy.We look at a first case: The Arab Spring and aim at understanding how an online community that started on Facebook materialized in urban space, changing the political landscape. Addressing these contemporaneous events does not come without analytical challenges. Therefore, we use and extend a semiotic analytical tool to face the representational complexity: Finally, online communities can also have social costs by providing an echo chamber to socially undesirable behaviors."
"This research studies the concept of fetishism as a magical relationship to products in the context of contemporary consumption. Fetishism is conceptualized as a multi-dimensional construct underlining the attribution of an aura and magical powers to a product. This research explores the way consumers develop fetishist relationships to products through exposure to puffed ads. To do this, this research introduces a conceptualization and a scale of fetishism in the context of contemporary consumption by conducting a qualitative exploratory study as well as two scale development studies. We also carry out a survey to show how product fetishism stems from transformation expectations about the product. Finally, we conduct an experiment to demonstrate the way a magical puffed claim in an ad influences the emergence of transformation expectations for the consumer. The results show that magical puffed claims positively influence transformation expectations only if the advertised brand is unknown by the respondent. The results also suggest that a known brand rather provoke transformation expectations through factual claims."
"This study explores how actors develop a new business model in an established firm. As a firms’ performance improvement source, new business model development require actor’s important efforts for their environment understanding and reinterpretation of value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms. Consequently, we are interested in how the articulation between cognition and action drives the business model innovation process over time. We adopt a sensemaking perspective to shed light actors’ meaning construction processes underlying business model innovation. We studied a new business model development process in a management consulting firm through an ethnographic stance. Findings show that through various social interactions, actors’ construction and destruction meaning processes shape business model innovation. Specific to established firms context, the company’s prevailing activities play an ambivalent role in a new business model development : sometimes favoriting it, sometimes hampering it."
"The dissertation reviews the effects, on capital markets, of implementing, within the EU, an excise tax (the FTT) on all financial transactions. We review the effects on the volatility, the liquidity, trading volumes and the price of assets.  In Chapter I, we analyze the option market-makers hedging strategies. We conclude to an insignificant effect of the FTT in highly liquid options markets, as opposed to a significant effect in low liquid option markets, the maximum being reached when market makers hold positions until their expiration date. Chapter II evidences a negative impact of the FTT on the corporate cost of capital due to the illiquidity of long dated option markets, and the arbitrage between equity and credit derivatives. The FTT would increase considerably the cost of capital of European companies whose main competitors are outside the EU.In Chapter III, we model both stocks and bonds theoretical prices and conduct simulations of their reaction to the introduction of the FTT. We find that both shares and bond prices will be negatively affected by the FTT, increasing the cost of capital, in the short and long run. Companies with high leverage and a low tax rate will see the price of their shares fall further than the price of shares of comparable, high-tax, leveraged companies. This suggests that EU should level all corporation tax rates, within the EU, prior to the introduction of the FTT. Finally, the FTT has an antagonistic effect to the Basel III regulation which seeks to increase the capital of banks, because at the same time it lowers the prices of securities issued by Banks. In conclusion, our original approach focusing on options, is fruitful. It makes possible to quantify the impact of FTT on volatility and allows a theoretical justification of the negative impact on asset prices found in empirical reviews of past experience of the introduction of a FTT."
"The main objective of this thesis is to analyse how cognitive and emotional biases affect investor decisions when buying or selling office buildings. To meet this aim, this research embarks on a qualitative research. Semi-structured interviews permit to detect and analyse the most important biases that appear in the transactions. Among the different biases discovered, the ""base-rate fallacy"" was selected. This bias may appear before the acquisition when investors evaluate the expected performance of a building. A quantitative analysis follows to develop a scale that tries to measure the effect of the bias. The results showed that uncertainty leads some investors to assume that the yield they will obtain at the end of their investment will be equal to that of the initial yield. In other words, some investors believe that market conditions will remain the same as today."
"To face the climate change, energy transition is required. Energy transition is a societal transition, which is really challenging because of its singularities. The multi-level governance is necessary in order to act now for the energy transition. Indeed States take action by negotiating international agreements for the climate on the one hand, and on the other hand by legislating their national regulatory framework. Local authorities intervene too owing to their competencies which give them a high influence power on decentralized production system and on energy consumption. The local scale plays a major role because they benefit from closed and trustful relationships which foster collective action and act as a real leverage. It is at the territories level that energy transition projects emerge and that fight against global warming become true. That's why it is necessary to understand what types of local projects for the energy transition arise, and what is their economic, social and environmental performance. This can allow public authorities to identify what are the performant projects and to encourage to replicate them on the one hand, and on the other hand to remove barriers in order to make arise innovant projects. In the long run, we must understand what kinds of projects will unfold and generalize as part of the energy transition depending on the value they will generate. To answer this, the business models perspective is highly appropriate: it constitutes an analytical framework which allows to describe the project features (its value proposition, its value configuration) and to determine its viability and sustainability according to the (economic, financial, social, environmental) values creation it builds. The thesis puts forward a typology of energy transition business models at the local scale, an analytical framework for projects adapted to the energy transition societal stake. Finally the thesis suggests some public policy recommandation in terms of assessment of the economic, social and environmental performance of the local projects for the energy transition."
"This PhD dissertation is built around four main chapters. Their topic shall sound familiar to policy makers, and to all empirical economists working on microenterprises, as they quesion the common mottos to deal with the informal sector:  “formalize them”, “protect them”, and “train them”. Little of these recommendations rely on actual evidence, in particular regarding their effects for the firms themselves. Chapter one starts by questioning the relevance of formalization: what exactly do these production units have to gain from registration? The second chapter investigates the vulnerability of microenterprises to health problems: how much do they suffer from the consequences of health shocks within the household? The third chapter deals with the complementary question of the protection mechanisms, and questions the mitigating potential of health insurance. The fourth chapter finally deals with their managerial capital: do the business skills that are considered standard among larger firms have any meaning for informal micro enterprises?"
We address the discrete time resource-constrained project scheduling problem in which each activity has a specified work content and its resource usage may vary from period to period. We consider temporary work and overtime as additional renewable resources for crashing the project. We assume that the project quality may be affected by crashing as well as its completion time through productivity loss due to overmanning. We develop a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to minimise the makespan subject to a budget constraint and to acceptable quality levels for all activities so as to avoid rework. The proposed approach is applied to an actual manufacturing project of a very high speed train motor coach.
"This thesis aims to explore the optimal choice of retirement system for the Palestinian case motivated primarily by the problems of high poverty rate and the noticeably low coverage rate of social security.Accordingly, the first chapter focused on the environmental analysis of the Palestinian case. The second chapter focused on the literature review of social security. The third chapter explores the access rate to social security systems in each aspect of social security by socioeconomic characteristics. While, fourth chapter present an econometric analysis about the decision to participate at the pension system.  Finally, chapter five presents and discusses guidelines for an optimal alternative pension reform followed by a projection test for proposed parameters of DB scheme using PROST model (World Bank) in several scenarios. The results determined the most important characteristics that increase the probability to participate to a pension system. Further, the projection shows the proper contribution rates in each unemployment scenario and its impact on the balance of the system and adequacy of income given the specific situation of  females in Palestine."
"Organisations’ members are increasingly permanently moving. They talk on the phone while walking, they attend meeting remotely and they share coworking space for a limited period of time. People are increasingly navigating their workspace rather than settling in it. The train station is a perfect example of this spatial and temporal trend. Our empirical question emerged from our fieldwork at the SNCF, which is currently reshaping space within its stations, and deeply re-thinking the role of its field agents. This reorganisation takes place in a context of digitalisation of the organisation’s historic activities. In that regard, we are seeing a paradigm shift in the role of commercial agents, who now become increasingly mobile. Moving agents contrast with a common historical perception of train stations as an aggregation of areas which functions and uses are closed, fixed and stable. This empirical observation converges with a theoretical gap: despite an awareness for “in-between” spaces in organization studies, the literature has paid little attention to how these spaces are enacted through work practices. Indeed, this literature is still more focused on the experience of users and travellers in these spaces, rather than the laboring bodies which are producing space in their everyday work. In this doctoral work, we approach the transitional aspect of space as an experience and a process closely related to work practices. We conducted an ethnography around several French train stations and undertook participant observation of central management for three years at SNCF. This empirical work allows a better understanding of professions and space planning processes. We analyse space and time through commercial agents’ three key practices: sales, information and boarding. We focus on embodied practices, by adopting a phenomenological approach. This study sheds light on the ways practices create a transitional spacetime. In order to the space to be crossed, movements are needed. Those movements are like meeting points which direct, orient, advise or reassure travellers. We contribute to organization theories literature about organizational space and embodied practices by conceptualizing the role of boundaries-gestures in those experiences which encompass spatial, temporal, material and embodied dimensions. We also offer strategic and management contributions by enhancing our understanding of flow and logic required in traveller’s journey."
"Coworking is an emerging phenomenon of the 21st century. The first coworking space in Paris opened in 2008. This research work has been conducted between 2015 and 2018 through an autoethnographic research design. I used to work as a community manager while cultivating both critical and phenomenological perspectives. This work aims at understanding the phenomenon ""from the inside"". Based on two fieldworks and a broader exploration of the Parisian ecosystem of coworking, the thesis identifies twelve practices of legitimation of coworking that have gradually contributed to the emergence of the field of coworking. At the same time, these legitimizing practices have challenged the position of the individual in the community and in society. In addition to institutional theory and phenomenology, I analyze this phenomenon from the anarchist humanist tradition."
"The logistics service provider (3PL) is reorganizing the activities of its warehouse to be efficient (C.-L. Liu and Lyons 2011). In fact, 3PL needs a detailed knowledge of the cost of the activities of its warehouses. The theoretical framework of this thesis lies at the intersection between warehouse, design and costs. Concerning the design of the warehouses, the selection, and especially the identification of all resources, are not much studied (S. S. Heragu et al. 2005; Gu, Goetschalckx, and McGinnis 2010). Concurrently, activity-based costing (ABC) is a cost calculation method which is little applied for obtaining warehouse costs (Pirttilä and Hautaniemi 1995). Several obstacles hinder its application, including the lack of formalization in the definition of activities (Waeytens and Bruggeman 1994).Using qualitative research within the enterprise FM Logistic, a classification of warehouse resources and a reference model of warehouse activities are proposed. The warehouse resource classification allows the identification of all the warehouse resources. The classification is then mobilised within the reference model of warehouse activities. The reference model facilitates the application of the ABC by standardizing the vocabulary to define the activities of the warehouse. The reference model is then employed for different applications, as part of the design of warehouse activities of a logistic service provider."
"In economy, the  competition  analysis among  firms have a  significance  importance because of the complexity of some elements. This thesis  examines the strategic interactions on  differentiated markets in general equilibrium while proposing the public policies  to reduce the distortions due to the imperfect behaviors. This thesis takes into account the differentiation of products in order to obtain the  new conclusions and/or to extend those existing. We  thus pursues two objectives. Fisrt, the construction of a model of imperfect competition on differentiated markets in  a general equilibrium framework. Second, the evaluation of the consequences of the model in terms of economic policies. At beginning,  we use literature review to tackle successively price mechanisms in strategic market games, product differentiation concepts and  game theory models dealing with strategic interactions  in order to model imperfect behaviors. This led in chapter 2 to the symmetric Cournot-Walras equilibrium concept on differentiated markets where we assign to each economic agent a  finite vector of differentiation  coefficients which expresses the agent's love for diversity. Following the differentiation  model, chapter 3 offers tax policy mechanisms to control losses due to perfect behavior of firms. From the analysis, it appears that some  examples illustrate that  the differentiation model admits a trivial equilibrium which is nice and the price and allocations of symmetrical Cournot-Walras equilibrium on differentiated product, under certain conditions, converge towards the Walrasian ones."
"After the music and the audiovisual industries, it is the turn of the publishing world to start its digital revolution. The proper functioning of the cultural industries is based on a specific and old intellectual property law: the copyright. Economics usually identifies it as the guarantor of a subtle balance between the incentive for the creation of authors and good dissemination of their works. The emergence of digital technology modifies the economic environment in which copyright applies and therefore alters its traditional effects. This doctoral thesis in economics aims at seizing such new consequences on the book market in order to assess the relevance of copyright in its current form and its possible revision. The analysis of the two aspects of copyright shows that it does not produce the same effects in the market of digital books than in the traditional one: despite the decrease of economic constraints, the current legal framework remains rigid and challenges both the stability of author’s remuneration and the sound management of the dissemination opportunities on the digital book market. That is why we discuss some general principles applicable to an effective copyright and suggest some guidelines for the renewal of the copyright regulation allowing to seize opportunities offered by the digital technology both in terms of encouraging the creation and distribution of books."
"By its prototypical nature, each musical good, and by extension each cultural good, is new. The aim of this thesis is two study the consumption and the funding of musical novelty, using two experimental approaches : the use of in-lab experiments to study demand (part I) and the use of experimental measures to understand field behaviors (part II). The first part explores the determinants and characteristics of demand for novelty. In the first chapter, we study the demand concentration when consumers can choose between established artists and new entrants. The second chapter presents estimations of an almost ideal demand system for four musical genres. The second part of this thesis focuses on contributors’ behaviors of a reward-based crowdfunding platform. In a third chapter, we propose a model of decision to contribute to a musical project, based on the observation that contributors are exposed to two types of risk : a risk of coordination failure and a risk of non delivery. With this in mind, illusion of control allows to understand the timing of decision. A closer look at the role of risk preferences shows that risk aversion is negatively correlated with contributions when coordination is ensured. On the contrary, the correlation becomes positive at the beginning of a campaign. In the last chapter, we investigate the mixed nature of crowdfunding. Results suggest that the decision to contribute falls within a donation logic while the decision on how much to contribute falls within a consumption logic."
"In the 70s, European countries have started seeing a significant politicization of environmental issues. This trend was expressed by political parties through a platform of environmental public policies during political campaigns, as well as the setting of environmental budgets by the presidents during their terms of office. By means of five essays falling into the scope of the Public Choice School of Thought, this thesis aims at determining whether politicians’ behavior have been motivated by self-interest or rather by global well-being satisfaction.The first chapter examines how environmental issues have integrated the spectrum of French political parties of all ideologies whereas the second chapter analyses the determinants of an environmental offer and this within the European political parties since 1970. Chapter 3 and 4 focus on environmental public spending done dy European countries since 1995, and analyze the application of the environmental political pledges and the impact of the electoral rules inplace on environmental public spending at both, the central budget scale and the total budget scale of states. Chapter 5 compares political entrepreneurship to associative entrepreneurship and market entrepreneurship to determine the most efficient way of solving environmental issues."
"The four research articles composing this PhD dissertation study the sharing of fiscal resources used to provide common public goods or transfers to contribute to macroeconomic stabilization. In the first chapter, we consider an optimal centralization problem with jurisdictions that have heterogeneous preferences for public goods and tax a mobile base to finance them. We adopt a theoretical model with a federal structure and a continuum of public goods to draw several normative conclusions from the study of the optimal degree of centralization. The contribution of this second chapter is to consider a tax competition model where public goods potentially exhibit cross-border spillovers. We show that full cooperation can be attained if spillovers in public good provision are high enough to remove the incentives to remain a low-tax non-cooperative player. In the third chapter, we build a DSGE model of the euro area (with a core and a periphery) with nominal, labor and financial rigidities. A baseline model where policies are only national, as it is the case now, is set as the reference for calibration which reproduces key empirical observations for the euro area. Then, we implement a common unemployment insurance and study its stabilization properties. The fourth chapter focuses on how a fiscal capacity targeting directly households can improve stabilization at the zero lower bound."
"The breakthrough of mobile shopping applications is a recent phenomenon. The increasing use of smartphones in retail stores (i.e. more than 70% of consumers) has led retailers to develop these tools to help consumers make smarter purchases. However, similar to Self-service technologies (e.g. automatic cash registers), mobile applications raise many issues, particularly regarding the factors that create customer value. The objective of our research is therefore to measure the value of a mobile purchasing support application for the customer in the context of a retail store. It also involves determining the consequences on the relationship with the retail store. This work is based on the literature on the concept of value and on mobile purchasing assistance applications. Qualitative exploratory research in the form of focus groups highlights the benefits and costs associated with the use of mobile applications in the retail store. Various conditional elements that can moderate the link effects of these applications are also identified: type of retail store (food versus multimedia), type of application (""Pull"" versus ""Push"") and level of personalization (personalized versus non-personalized). This leads us to the construction of a scale for measuring the value in use of an application and to the development of a conceptual model that incorporates the hybrid approach of value. This model aims to describe the creation of global value resulting from the use of a mobile purchasing assistance application and to identify the impact of this global value on loyalty. This model is tested using an experimental methodology for which fictive applications have been specially designed. Five successive quantitative studies are conducted on a total sample of more than 1000 students. Multigroup analysis are used to measure the moderating effects of conditional elements: The results show that the global value induced by the use of these mobile applications influences loyalty to the point of sale. Each of the conditional elements has moderating effects on the model links. The moderating effects of the ""Push"" application type combined with the high level of personalization achieve the best results with the creation of a significant global value impacting loyalty to the point of sale."
"A growing number of contemporary scientific organizations collaborate with crowds for diverse tasks of the scientific process. These collaborations are often designed as citizen science projects. The collaboration is an opportunity for scientific structures in a context of massive data deluge which lead organizations to face limits in terms of resources and capabilities. However, in such new forms of cooperation a major crisis is caused when tasks delegated to the crowd require a certain inventiveness - solving problems, formulating scientific hypotheses - and when these projects have to be repeated in the organization. From two experimental studies based on an original modeling, this thesis studies the management mechanisms needed to ensure the performance of projects delegated to the crowd. We show that the performance is linked to the management of two types of capitalization: a cross-capitalization (each participant can reuse the work of the other participants); a sequential capitalization (capitalization by the participants then by the organizers). In addition, this research highlights the figure of a new managerial figure to support the capitalization, the ""manager of inventive crowds"", essential for the success of the projects."
"Thorstein Veblen, author of The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), is memorialized in economics by the “Veblen effect,” a term introduced by Harvey Leibenstein to represent a positive consumer demand response to an increase in price. However, Leibenstein’s 1950 QJE article introducing the world to the “Veblen effect” does not cite Veblen as one of its 17 references.I begin this dissertation by revisiting Veblen’s theory of consumer behavior and evaluating its subsequent treatment in the economics literature. I find that Leibenstein (1950) misunderstands Veblen’s concept of “conspicuous consumption” and contradicts Veblen’s empirical predictions.How might Veblen’s theory be interpreted more faithfully with relevance to present-day markets? I suggest that the notion of “Veblen goods” and “Veblen consumers” is misleading, because Veblen’s theories applied to nearly all goods and consumers. My alternative approach is to look for attributes and corresponding prices whose market behavior is in line with Veblen’s predictions. I divide the attributes of goods into three classes, and I suggest that each class has its own hedonic price component: “useful,” “decorative,” and “invisible” attributes.Invisible attributes cannot be detected by the consumer’s own unaided sensory apparatus. Examples of invisible attributes are a good’s market price, scarcity, reputation, ratings, place of origin, microbial content, organic certification, and age. I refer to decorative and invisible attributes, together, as “Veblen attributes”; and I refer to the premiums consumers are willing to pay for Veblen attributes as “Veblen premiums.”In this thesis, I attempt to observe some Veblen attributes and Veblen premiums in present-day consumer markets. I report experimental results from the U.S. retail markets for beer (part II), wine (part III), and food (part IV). I employ a variety of experimental techniques, including consumer surveys, blind tasting experiments, lab experiments, and undercover experiments. I include several first-person essays to round out the narrative."
"Rare earth crisis in 2010 showed the importance of some materials and whipped up interest in the research on material criticality. A review work was first conducted in order to get a better understanding of the existing work in this research area and to see where more work is needed. Based on this review, three research gaps were identified (lack of a comprehensive diagnosis of criticality; lack of evaluation methodology at the product level; lack of links between the mechanism of criticality, the evaluation methodology and the solutions offered. This thesis focuses on the two first research gaps and offers several ideas for the last one. Regarding diagnosis of criticality, the mechanism is illustrated under four dimensions: imbalance between supply and demand, importance of the material to product, supply accessibility and dynamic factors. A definition of criticality is also put forward. Considering the established mechanism as research core, a methodology to evaluate the criticality of materials at the product level has been developed and is completed with a concrete and quantitative model. The methodology offers guidance on how to assess criticality and sets a framework for evaluation. The model illustrates a way to use this methodology through a tool that assigns a ‘criticality score’ to materials and shows how the score is contributed. The calculations were automated in Excel. Two applications, one for permanent magnet and the other for light emitting diode, were conducted to demonstrate and improve the methodology and the model"
"There are different approaches to implement sustainability and Design for Sustainability (DfS) is the one that give more accurate result by considering both global and regional scales. Integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is an example of tool integration to support sustainability. In LCA framework, Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) is the quantified and classified list of input and output flow of the LCA model that is a model of the product system, linking the technological system to the ecosphere (Environment system). As each region has a unique environmental system, design characteristics and specifications of technological system should be modified and adopted based on these differences. Implementation of this approach will require geographical information of interacted environmental systems, which is a kind of new strategy in DfS. Therefore, we tested the interest of the integration of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) with PLM to support geographical considerations during product development activities. The main research question of this research work is then how to propose this PLM-GIS integration for DfS. Thus, we conducted that literature review on existing data models about product, environment, geography and their combination is a key to prove the link among them"
"The constant demand for capacity increase, together with the foreseen saturation of the single-mode optical fiber, paved the way to technological breakthroughs that have completely changed the landscape of fiber-optic telecommunications. The most important advance was, undeniably, the practical implementation of a coherent detection with the help of high-speed electronics. This has, first, enabled the use of advanced modulation formats that allowed for a more efficient use of the fiber bandwidth, compared to the classical On-Off Keying, while adapted algorithms could not be used in order to mitigate the optical signal degradation. This thesis began a little after the advent of coherent detection and its main objective was to revisit the propagation effects in optical transmission systems using ""Quadrature phase shift keying"" (QPSK) modulation in the context of terrestrial systems, i.e. for transmission distances of up to about 2000 km. The manuscript is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to a study on the data sequences that need to be used in numerical simulations, when advanced modulation is involved. Fiber propagation, and in particular the interplay between chromatic dispersion and nonlinearities, usually introduce a nonlinear inter-symbol interference (ISI) to the transmitted signal. Since this ISI depends on the actual transmitted data pattern, it is obvious that the choice of the sequence used in our numerical simulations will have a direct influence on the estimated channel quality. Since, an infinite length, random sequence is impractical; we very commonly use pseudorandom"" (PR) sequences, i.e. finite-length, deterministic sequences with balanced pattern statistics that seem to be random. In the first part we describe the method of generating M-level (with M&gt;2) pseudorandom sequences and we detail their properties. In addition, we propose numerical tools to characterize the non-pseudorandom sequences that we use in numerical simulations, or we are sometimes forced to use in laboratory experiments. Finally, we present results of numerical simulations that quantify the necessity to use PR sequences as a function of our system parameters. After having established the “fairest possible” finite sequences, in the second part of the manuscript, we focus on the study of the nonlinear propagation, in the context of a transmission system using QPSK modulation and assuming a variable dispersion management and fiber type. Specifically, we numerically study the signal statistics due to the interplay of chromatic dispersion and nonlinear effects, neglecting all polarization or multi-wavelength effects and the amplifier noise. In this context, we were first interested in determining whether some empirical laws developed for OOK systems, can be also used in the case of QPSK modulation, such as the criterion of cumulative nonlinear phase (ΦNL) or laws that allow for a quick optimization of the dispersion management. Next we reveal the importance of a global phase rotation added to the initial signal constellation, as a parameter that can provide interesting information for the post-optimization of our system. We also discuss the fact that the constellation shape critically depends on the applied dispersion management, while there are generally 3 types of constellations, concerning the complex signal statistics: (1) the phase variance is higher than the amplitude variance (2) the amplitude variance is higher than the phase variance and (3) the received signal constellation resembles to a constellation of a signal under the influence of just an Additive White Gaussian Noise. Finally, we provide a phenomenological explanation of the constellations shapes revealing the fact that different data sub-sequences suffer from a different kind of signal degradation, while we also use this information to define a parameter that quantifies the potential benefit from a MAP (Maximum A Posteriori probability) correction algorithm"
"We investigate, in this thesis, the use of Hierarchical Modulation (HM), a physical layer technique that enables to exploit multiuser diversity, for resource allocation in OFDMA-based systems with and without use of relaying, so as to improve the system capacity. HM allows the sharing of the resources, namely subcarriers and power, between users of different radio conditions by sending an additional stream to a user with good radio conditions on a subcarrier that was initially allocated to carry an original stream to a user with lower radio conditions. And this, without affecting the original user's rate nor the total amount of power assigned to the shared subcarrier. In the literature, most of the works that consider the use of HM focus solely on the physical layer performance, notably in terms of the bit error rate. And this for a static user scenario,i.e., with a fixed number of users in the system, each with an infinite service duration. This configuration however does not reflect the real system behavior where the number of users is dynamic, i.e., the users come to the system at random time epochs and leave it after a finite duration, corresponding to the completion of their services. The study of the system at the flow-level, as opposed to the packet level, for a dynamic user configuration, enables us to investigate the realistic relationship between capacity and demand and to quantify several system-level performance metrics, such as mean transfer times and blocking rates, which are meaningful both to the user and the network operator/provider."
"Positioning systems have undeniably progressed. Currently, in an outdoor environment, the accuracy reaches a few centimetres under certain conditions: open space, clear sky, specific measurement techniques, etc. Nevertheless, the problem of positioning in an indoor environment remains persistent: multipath, attenuation, etc. Different systems for indoor positioning have been developed, using technologies such as UWB, WiFi or Infrared. These systems provide interesting results that could allow to reach one meter accuracy. But, this accuracy is related to many criteria: infrastructure, technology, calibration, technical computing, etc. To reduce these constraints, we propose a new approach for positioning. Our approach utilizes all the network equipments present in an environment. The approach is based on two fundamental steps: the study of visibility and the development of geographical links. The study of visibility estimates the visible equipments in the environment. We have studied several models of visibility and we carried out a comparison of the results. A three-dimensional graph is build using the study of geographical links between equipments. This graph allows us to visualize the distribution of equipments and to estimate the geographic positions of each device. To implement our approach, we developed a simulator in Matlab. The simulator first studies the visible equipments for the unknown device. Then, it estimates the distances between the device and the visible equipments. Finally, it constructs a graph and calculates the geographical positions. Simulation results are presented to validate our approach. Our approach is a positioning system capable of operating without additional infrastructure in an indoor environment"
"Being mobile, the wireless sensors must adapt to the changing environment. Therefore, in the first part of this thesis we propose a mechanism to adapt the WSN architecture dynamically based on the detected context; this includes the dynamic detection of the topology change, the detection of the new context and consequently the dynamic adaptation of the communication layer. All of these actions are executed under constraints on energy consumption. The work done in this part poses the question of detecting the new context. This is a rather difficult question because it is unclear. The purpose of the second part is to detect on the fly the type of the competitor technology generating a traffic that interferes with the WSN. The proposed mechanism, FIM, identifies the cause of interference from errors model observed in the corrupt data packets. The context detection allows the nodes of the sensor network to obtain information about the environment. Some nodes must have more reliable information on the environment than others. How to retrieve the information?  From which neighboring nodes? And what information to keep as safe and useful? Are the questions that are addressed in the third part. We propose a mechanism to dynamically decide if docition mechanisms should be used or not"
"Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) aim at making communication between mobile nodes feasible without any infrastructure support. Sparse MANETs fall into the class of Delay Tolerant Networks which are intermittently connected networks and where there is no contemporaneous end-to-end path at any given time. We first, propose a new reliable transport scheme for DTNs based on the use of ACKnowledgments and random linear coding. We model the evolution of the network under our scheme using a fluid-limit approach. We optimize our scheme to obtain mean file transfer times on certain optimal parameters obtained through differential evolution approach. Secondly, we propose and study a novel and enhanced ACK to improve reliable transport for DTNs covering both unicast and multicast flows. We make use of random linear coding at relays so that packets can reach the destination faster. We obtain reliability based on the use of so-called Global Selective ACKnowledgment. We obtain significant improvement through G-SACKs and coding at relays. Finally, we tackle the problem of estimating file-spread in DTNs with direct delivery and epidemic routing. We estimate and track the degree of spread of a message in the network. We provide analytical basis to our estimation framework alongwith insights validated with simulations. We observe that the deterministic fluid model can indeed be a good predictor with a large   of nodes. Moreover, we use Kalman filter and Minimum- Mean-Squared-Error (MMSE) to track the spreading process and find that Kalman filter provides more accurate results as compared to MMSE"
"The digital footprints collected from the prevailing sensing systems provide novel ways to perceive an individual's behaviors. Furthermore, large collections of digital footprints from communities bring novel understandings of human behaviors from the community perspective (community behaviors), such as investigating their characteristics and learning the hidden human intelligence. The perception of human behaviors from the sensing digital footprints enables novel applications for the sensing systems. Bases on the digital footprints collected with accelerometer-embedded mobile phones and GPS equipped taxis, in this dissertation we present our work in recognizing individual behaviors, capturing community behaviors and demonstrating the novel services enabled. With the GPS footprints of a taxi, we summarize the individual anomalous passenger delivery behaviors and improve the recognition efficiency of the existing method iBOAT by introducing an inverted index mechanism. Besides, based on the observations in real life, we propose a method to detect the work-shifting events of an individual taxi. With real-life large-scale GPS traces of thousands of taxis, we investigate the anomalous passenger delivery behaviors and work shifting behaviors from the community perspective and exploit taxi serving strategies. We find that most anomaly behaviors are intentional detours and high detour inclination won't make taxis the top players. And the spatial-temporal distribution of work shifting events in the taxi community reveals their influences. While exploiting taxi serving strategies, we propose a novel method to find the initial intentions in passenger finding. Furthermore, we present a smart taxi system as an example to demonstrate the novel applications that are enabled by the perceived individual and community behaviors"
"Nowadays, each user or organization is already connected to a large number of sensor nodes which generate a substantial amount of data, making their management not an obvious issue. In addition, these data can be confidential. For these reasons, developing a secure system managing the data from heterogeneous sensor nodes is a real need. In the first part, we developed a composite-based  middleware for wireless sensor networks to communicate with the physical sensors for storing, processing, indexing, analyzing and generating alerts on those sensors data. Each composite is connected to a physical node or used to aggregate data from different composites. Each physical node communicating with the middleware is setup as a composite. The middleware has been used in the context of the European project Mobesens in order to manage data from a sensor network for monitoring water quality. In the second part of the thesis, we proposed a new hybrid authentication and key establishment scheme between senor nodes (SN), gateways (MN) and the middleware (SS). It is based on two protocols. The first protocol intent is the mutual authentication between SS and MN, on providing an asymmetric pair of keys for MN, and on establishing a pairwise key between them. The second protocol aims at authenticating them, and establishing a group key and pairwise keys between SN and the two others. The middleware has been generalized in the third part in order to provide a private space for multi-organization or -user to manage his sensors data using cloud computing. Next, we expanded the composite with gadgets to share securely sensor data in order to provide a secure social sensor network"
"This Ph.D. thesis specifically deals with the issue of metamorphosis of 3D objects represented as 3D triangular meshes. The objective is to elaborate a complete 3D mesh morphing methodology which ensures high quality transition sequences, smooth and gradual, consistent with respect to both geometry and topology, and visually pleasant. Our first contributions concern the two different approaches of parameterization: a new barycentric mapping algorithm based on the preservation of the mesh length ratios, and a spherical parameterization technique, exploiting a Gaussian curvature criterion. The experimental evaluation, carried out on 3D models of various shapes, demonstrated a considerably improvement in terms of mesh distortion for both methods. In order to align the features of the two input models, we have considered a warping technique based on the CTPS C2a radial basis function suitable to deform the models embeddings in the parametric domain maintaining a valid mapping through the entire movement process. We show how this technique has to be adapted in order to warp meshes specified in the parametric domains. A final contribution consists of a novel algorithm for constructing a pseudo-metamesh that avoids the complex process of edge intersections encountered in the state-of-the-art. The obtained mesh structure is characterized by a small number of vertices and it is able to approximate both the source and target shapes. The entire mesh morphing framework has been integrated in an interactive application that allows the user to control and visualize all the stages of the morphing process"
"Recent advances in telecommunications, collaborated with the development of image and video processing and acquisition devices has lead to a spectacular growth of the amount of the visual content data stored, transmitted and exchanged over Internet. Within this context, elaborating efficient tools to access, browse and retrieve video content has become a crucial challenge. In Chapter 2 we introduce and validate a novel shot boundary detection algorithm able to identify abrupt and gradual transitions. The technique is based on an enhanced graph partition model, combined with a multi-resolution analysis and a non-linear filtering operation. The global computational complexity is reduced by implementing a two-pass approach strategy. In Chapter 3 the video abstraction problem is considered. In our case, we have developed a keyframe representation system that extracts a variable number of images from each detected shot, depending on the visual content variation. The Chapter 4 deals with the issue of high level semantic segmentation into scenes. Here, a novel scene/DVD chapter detection method is introduced and validated. Spatio-temporal coherent shots are clustered into the same scene based on a set of temporal constraints, adaptive thresholds and neutralized shots. Chapter 5 considers the issue of object detection and segmentation. Here we introduce a novel spatio-temporal visual saliency system based on: region contrast, interest points correspondence, geometric transforms, motion classes’ estimation and regions temporal consistency. The proposed technique is extended on 3D videos by representing the stereoscopic perception as a 2D video and its associated depth"
"Advanced modulation formats, encoding data on the phase, polarization or multi-level intensity of the light are currently a hot topic in the telecommunication domain. By using them, high spectral efficiency and therefore higher bit rate signals could be generated. Those characteristics are really attractive for the telecommunication systems manufacturers in order to answer to the constant need of increased bandwidth in fiber optic communications. The study of advanced modulation formats generation in Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) based on a new concept of preset phases switching by Electro-Absorption Modulators is the main task of the current work. Compared to the actual technology used for generate advanced modulations, our choice could allow a strong reduction of the dimensions and of the energy consumption of the transmitter as well as bit rate up to 56 GB. After validating specific transmitters’ architectures by simulations, we fabricated the studied photonic integrated circuits in clean room. Through static characterizations, we verify that all integrated functions of the transmitters are working and we show the efficiency of our technological choices. Using the available equipments at the lab, we prove the validity of our concept of EAM based phase switching by using a BPSK transmitter. A 12.4 GB BPSK modulation is obtained as well as a wide open eye diagram. This result demonstrates the smallest BPSK integrated photonic source at this time. Another photonic circuit able to generate more complex modulation formats is also measured"
"This thesis addresses new security challenges in the Internet of Things (IoT). The current transition from legacy Internet to Internet of Things leads to multiple changes in its communication paradigms. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) initiated this transition by introducing unattended wireless topologies, mostly made of resource constrained nodes, in which radio spectrum therefore ceased to be the only resource worthy of optimization. Today's Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things architectures further accentuated this trend, not only by involving wider architectures but also by adding heterogeneity, resource capabilities inconstancy and autonomy to once uniform and deterministic systems. The heterogeneous nature of IoT communications and imbalance in resources capabilities between IoT entities make it challenging to provide the required end-to-end secured connections. Unlike Internet servers, most of IoT components are characterized by low capabilities in terms of both energy and computing resources, and thus, are unable to support complex security schemes. The setup of a secure end-to-end communication channel requires the establishment of a common secret key between both peers, which would be negotiated relying on standard security key exchange protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake or Internet Key Exchange (IKE). Nevertheless, a direct use of existing key establishment protocols to initiate connections between two IoT entities may be impractical because of the technological gap between them and the resulting inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives. The issue of adapting existing security protocols to fulfil these new challenges has recently been raised in the international research community but the first proposed solutions failed to satisfy the needs of resource-constrained nodes. In this thesis, we propose novel collaborative approaches for key establishment designed to reduce the requirements of existing security protocols, in order to be supported by resource-constrained devices. We particularly retained TLS handshake, Internet key Exchange and HIP BEX protocols as the best keying candidates fitting the end-to-end security requirements of the IoT. Then we redesigned them so that the constrained peer may delegate its heavy cryptographic load to less constrained nodes in neighbourhood exploiting the spatial heterogeneity of IoT nodes. Formal security verifications and performance analyses were also conducted to ensure the security effectiveness and energy efficiency of our collaborative protocols. However, allowing collaboration between nodes may open the way to a new class of threats, known as internal attacks that conventional cryptographic mechanisms fail to deal with. This introduces the concept of trustworthiness within a collaborative group. The trustworthiness level of a node has to be assessed by a dedicated security mechanism known as a trust management system. This system aims to track nodes behaviours to detect untrustworthy elements and select reliable ones for collaborative services assistance. In turn, a trust management system is instantiated on a collaborative basis, wherein multiple nodes share their evidences about one another's trustworthiness. Based on an extensive analysis of prior trust management systems, we have identified a set of best practices that provided us guidance to design an effective trust management system for our collaborative keying protocols. This effectiveness was assessed by considering how the trust management system could fulfil specific requirements of our proposed approaches for key establishment in the context of the IoT. Performance analysis results show the proper functioning and effectiveness of the proposed system as compared with its counterparts that exist in the literature"
"This thesis is a volume of 134 pages and includes 5 research articles. The thesis is a contribution to the empirical literature that has developed since the early 2000s on the changes introduced by the Internet trade in cultural property. It examines in particular a set of questions on the complementarity or substitution distribution channels, physical and virtual, the effect of the ""Long Tail Theory"" and price dispersion on the Internet. The interest of this thesis is to provide empirical evidence to the debate, thanks to the creation of databases obtained by automated data capture observable on the Internet. Statistical and econometric results from these studies detail the specifics of best-selling books, CDs and DVDs as distribution channels (Amazon, Amazon Marketplace, physical stores) but also according to their format (paper books / ebooks). Regarding price dispersion, the results show a low variability of prices by sellers of Amazon Marketplace and low impact of traditional measures of reputation (ratings of sellers) compared to the size of the catalog vendors challenging the using of notation as a proxy for reputation."
"This doctoral thesis in Management Sciences concerns the project WITE 2.0 dedicated to the analysis and the design of technical and organizational ICT device : an integrated platform for teleworking. This platform allows you to work ""remotely"" on a connected mode or not, from any device (PC, phone, tablet), on a ""thin client"" and in a work environment like « cloud computing ». Some questions have emerged related to the design of the platform : these questions concern the role of the information and communication technologies (ICT) in the progress of remote working. Our design of research is divided into two research’s actions : firstly, we wanted to know the diversity of remote working configurations and secondly, we wanted to understand how the appropriation’s codes and norms of the new technologies (used for the platform) take place. We followed an « situed action » perspective and a qualitative methodology based on semi-structured interviews and observations. In our results, we describe the remote working’s realities, the limitations of the technologies and the tactics built by the workers while they « enact » the technology remotly. We discovered some use’s norms, often in a tacit dimension, and use’s values of these new technologies. Finally we gave some managerial recommandations concerning the technical, use and service aspects."
"This thesis approaches several distinctive features of regulation and competition policy in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. It tackles some issues in ex-ante regulation on investment in new fixed telecommunications network infrastructures, and the application of margin squeeze tests by European regulatory authorities in the telecommunications industry. It also analyzes issues related to ex-post competition policy, such as the impact of bundling products with switching costs, or the competition authorities' investigations in the electronic book market. Further analysis on the impact of ex-ante regulation on ex-post competition policy is provided, in particular via studies on the definition of a margin squeeze conduct in network industries, and how competition authorities deal with it. Finally, this thesis evaluates several advantages and weaknesses of both ex-ante regulatory authorities' and ex-post competition authorities' interventions."
"This thesis approaches several issues related to the impact of sector-specific regulation on competition and investments in the electronic communication sector. More specifically, it raises the question of the relevance of regulation when applied to an old technology, when enhanced and affordable alternative technologies are available. It also analyzes how regulation affects competition between technologies and indirectly operators’ investments. Further analyses are provided for the fixed broadband market, with an assessment of the effect of competition via local loop unbundling on operators’ incentives to invest into fiber networks. Finally, this thesis evaluates the impact of very high-speed broadband networks on local economic growth, in terms of establishment creation and sole proprietorship creation. It attempts to quantify the economic benefits stemming from the roll-out of next generation access networks"
"Mobile app is becoming an important mobile internet access channel. Three groups of end users affiliated with two Two-sided platforms in the mobile app market have attracted considerable attention. App store platform (App-store) is an app distribution platform connected with developers and users. App ad platform (Ad-store) supplies advertising services for advertisers through developers’ apps. Developers, users and advertisers are end users. Mobile app market is a complicated two-sided market. There are widespread and interactive network externalities. The study focuses on the pricing strategies for the app store platform. App-store shares paid app sales and in-app purchase revenues with developers. Ad-store shares in-app advertising revenues with developers. The App-store platform implements asymmetric pricing to developer side and user side. Developer side is the subsidy side as well as the revenue side for App-store platform. Mobile device purchasing cost constitutes a particular App-store platform pricing determinant. Membership fees are negligible in the mobile app market. Usage fee is workable. It is a duopoly in the mobile app market. Apple and Google are the two giants with distinct business models. Both Apple’s mobile device sales model and Google’s in-app advertising model are extremely successful. App-store, Ad-store and mobile devices are the three key profit makers in this market. Vertical integration inside this ecosystem will generate considerable revenues. Chinese users have higher price elasticity of demand and they are particularly sensitive to the app prices when compared with the French."
"There is still scant knowledge in the economic and international business literature regarding two issues: - Valuation methods of modes of market entry and of investment by an international telecom operator, - The case of Africa as a host continent for these investments. The thesis deals with foreign investments in Africa in the telecom sector, focusing on two entry modes: license awards and acquisitions of local operators. Its objective is to demonstrate on what extent « local » factors (related to the host country and its local telecom market) have an impact on the valuation of these investments in sub-Saharan Africa. This work covers the issues of the strategic interest of these investments, the methods to valuate these investment opportunities, as well as the different factors to take into account in this valuation. A database has been developed, gathering all deals made by multinational operators in sub-Saharan Africa over 2000-2010. Several quantitative analyses have been conducted as from this corpus, in order to identify the determinants of deal amounts. This work demonstrates the lack of regularity and rationality in deals’ prices of the telecom sector in Africa."
"The first chapter of the thesis studies the advertising competition on the French broadcast TV market. We use a unique dataset on the French broadcast television market including audience, prices, and quantities of advertising of twenty-one TV channels from March 2008 to December 2013. We specify a structural model of oligopoly competition and identify the shape and magnitude of the feedback loop between TV viewers and advertisers. We also implement a simple procedure to identify the conduct of firms on the market. We find that the nature of competition in the French TV advertising market is of the Cournot type. Further, we provide empirical evidence that the price-cost margin is not a good indicator of the market power of firms operating on two-sided markets. In the second chapter, I use a theoretical model to analyze the competitive behavior of advertising financed media platforms. The platforms are specified to be horizontally differentiated and the market form is an oligopoly. The first major insight of the model is that the different platforms behave as strategic complements under Cournot competition. In particular, if a platform increases its quantity of advertising, it is optimal for its competitors to raise their respective advertising quantities as well. The model suggests that the merger of advertising sales houses of several platforms increases the advertising offers of all the competing platforms of the market (both the merged and unmerged), holding the quality of platforms unaffected. I further test the theoretical prediction with TV market data and model used in the first chapter, the empirical counterfactual simulation suggests same results as the theoretical model. Finally, in the last chapter, I investigate the welfare effect of the widespread policy of regulating advertising time on TV. The project exploits a novel dataset of per hour data on 12 broadcast TV channels in France during one year (2014). I first estimate the demand of TV viewers and of advertisers, which allows me to account for the two-sidedness of the market in the supply decision of TV stations. I show in this work how to identify the shadow prices of regulation when the regulatory constraints are observed. Finally, I conduct two counterfactual experiments to calibrate the welfare effects of the regulation. My results suggest that the regulation protects welfare of TV viewers, while its impact on the industry's profit can be either positive or negative, depending on the concentration level of the market. Given the two-sided market structure of the broadcast TV industry, regulating advertising time is unnecessary on a competitive market. However, when the market become concentrated, the regulation can improve up to 5.75% of consumer surplus, but decrease until 4.8% of the industry's profit. (...)"
"This dissertation draws from a sample of 13 000 clients of an online broker and 1.3M movements of buys and sells from January 2006 to June 2008. The results show that:1/ By regressing the buys and sells to the returns of the domestic index (CAC 40), the french individual investors have a contrarian behavior. This result is in line with the existing literature on ""noise traders"" and the market liquidity.2/ Through logistic regression of the purchase decision, we show that sophistication (that we proxy with the use of the SRD), is a strong factor explaining the purchase decision.These results can bring insights to the financial industry and help to the development of the financial litteracy."
"Quality in higher education has an undeniable interest at the international level. Confronted with the fact that there is a lack of consensus on the definition of this concept and a diversity of standards used, we propose a study aiming at understanding the implications of ISO 9001 certification on the quality of higher education. To that end, we have worked out a conceptual framework based on the literature devoted to this subject. This framework is a modelization of the dimensions of quality in higher education and constitutes, in accordance with the qualitative method of case studies, the outlook according to which data from three higher education institutions are collected and processed.Our case studies have been carried out in Morocco, where the ISO 9001 standard is, contrary to several other countries, the main referential used in higher education. Our results show that this certification can have several positive impacts on the quality of higher education, including pedagogical aspects, as long as the perimeter of the certification is well defined and the requirements of the standard are adapted to the specificities of higher education."
"Stable coronary artery disease is a chronic disease for which many treatment strategies are available, treatment with drugs alone and invasive treatment by stenting or coronary artery bypass graft. With the results of several meta-analyzes showing a mortality rate comparable between treatments, we decided to conduct a research comparing costs. In the first part of my work, we compared, after a period of one year and of 3 years of patient follow-up, clinical and economic data for five treatment of stable angina: medication alone, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty without stent, angioplasty with bare metal stent and angioplasty with drug-eluting stent. Mortality and MI rates were our clinical end point. Direct costs related to the treatment performed and related to the management of complications, have been standardized using the purchasing power parity and expressed in U.S. $ 2008. It was our criterion for economic analysis. A total of 19 clinical studies have been selected in our network meta-analysis. Our results show there is no significant difference in clinical end point. In contrast, we observed a difference in the average cost of each treatment after one year and three year follow-up. The least expensive treatment was the only treatment with drugs, after a year and 3 years of follow-up, each with an average cost per patient of U.S. $ 3,069 and U.S. $ 13,854. The highest average cost has been obtained with the treatment coronary artery bypass graft: U.S. $ 27,003 after one year and U.S. $ 28,670 after 3 years of follow-up. However, our conclusions are limited due to the high variability of the economic methods used in the selected studies and because of the evolution of revascularization techniques. In the second part of my research work, we calculated the cost of management of stable angina pectoris patients treated with one of the following four treatment strategies: medication alone, coronary artery bypass graft, angioplasty with bare metal stent and angioplasty with stent active. We defined a part 6 clinical situations corresponding to the possible clinical conditions of the patient one year after the treatment. We have defined the quantities of care consumed for each of these clinical situations. The perspective selected was the statutory health insurance in 2011. The calculated costs were related to hospitalization, ambulatory care and medical transport used to reach the hospital. The drug strategy was the least expensive with an average annual cost of € 1,518, the cost taking into account the probability of occurrence of 6 clinical conditions. Treatment with coronary artery bypass graft was the most expensive of the four treatments studied, with an average annual cost of € 15,237. The prospect of my work is to model the management of stable angina pectoris patient considering a second treatment if the first treatment led to a situation of treatment failure. The trees we built then allow us to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of two strategies with a total duration of patient follow-up of 2 years. Finally, if our work highlights the economic benefits of drug treatment, we emphasize that these results are obtained after following patients over a short period (1 year and 3 years), while stable angina is a chronic disease where therapeutic strategies may succeed in case of failure to one of the treatments. In addition, we keep in mind that the choice of treatment, whether conservative or by drugs, by invasive myocardial revascularization should be done individually, i.e. taking into account the individual characteristics of each patient."
"Many are those to consider that since the development of the curative medicine, the prevention occupied a secondary place in the French health care system. Major concern would have been up to that point to ensure an access to healthcare rather than to support a culture of prevention. Since a few years, various medical dramas (blood transfusion, asbestos, heat wave, growth hormone, flu epidemics,cancers,...) have raised awareness of the concept of “safety” and brings out a new awakening around the prevention problems.The use of prevention allows the individuals and the public authorities to exert a control on the health risks to which they are exposed and to conduct consequent actions in order to improve health and prevent the emergence, the development, the development or the aggravation of the diseases or accidents while promoting individual and collective behaviors that can help to reduce the risk health. One of the answers in front of the health risks is to incite the individuals to more prevention because they are not only consumers of care, but also producers of their health. What is the role of individuals and what is the share of responsibility reserved for each one in the prevention of health risks ? In addition, the prevention of health risks is part of an environment ambiguity and uncertainty because the risks to which are exposed individuals are many different ways and not always well known. It is thus not easy to connect with certainty a risk factor and a health effect for adopting an adequate prevention behavior. In this context of uncertainty, many support the decision models or representations of preferences have been proposed in recent years (and Klibanoff (al. (2005), and Bleichrodt Eeckhoudt (2006), Machina 2009), Etner et al. (2011)).This thesis analyzes the individual behaviors of prevention in front of health risks while focusing on the public policies of prevention proposed. It consists on the one hand in theoretical studies of the behaviors of prevention and management of the health risks by using recent models of preferences. This work analyzes the behavior of the individuals who need to take preventive measures to protect their own health in a context of uncertainty. On the other hand, it is devoted to an empirical study to determine perceptions and information which have the individuals in terms of risk of health. Moreover, throughout this work, we sought to examine the relevance of the theoretical model developed with regard to the policies practiced. The first chapter presents the principles of modeling economic decisions in the presence of a more or less well known health risk. After detailing the different approaches in models of decisions under risk and uncertainty, we have highlighted the importance of the introduction of two-dimensional variables (or multidimensional) in the model of choice to allow to report the multidimensional environment of health risks. The second chapter is an original proposed study on the analysis of preventive health when the individuals have an aversion to ambiguity. In this chapter, we studied individual behavior of prevention in front of an uncertainty on the health status and have showed that aversion to ambiguity encourages the individuals to make more primary and secondary prevention under the assumption of a marginal utility of the increasing wealth with the health status.

The aim is to highlight a definition of the dynamics of SMEs accross member of TUSKON (Turkish confederation of businessmen and industrialists), in relation to their motivations for economic success in the context of a spiritual depth research by their commitments in Hizmet movement's socio-educational projects.TUSKON offers a specific vision of islam /modernity report compared to that of MÜSIAD, anassociation of islamic businessmen. Our study is based on interviews and a sociological survey conducted among members of the BUGIAD association (member of TUSKON) in BURSA, allowing us to trace the evolution of socio-historical of TUSKON and sees how the dynamics of SMEs is influenced by the piety and the commitment of his boss in a socio-religious movement."
"Since the early 2000’s, oral anticancer drugs (OADs) are increasingly available especially for the treatment of breast cancer. This route of chemotherapy administration allows patients to take oral tablets at home improving their quality-of-life. We estimate that 10 to 34% of breast tumors over-express the HER2 protein  (HER2+) that increases the risk of developing metastasis. Two anti-HER2 targeted therapies are currently available: trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody administered intravenously and lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor administered orally. According to the recommendations of the National Agency for Accreditation and Evaluation in Health (ANAES, 2003), OADs should be administered when their efficacy is equivalent to the one of intravenous forms taken at hospital. In the current practice of oncologists, OADs seem to be underused in some cases. The medical brakes to the use of OADs (i.e. adherence, management of side effects) are well known. Nonetheless, OADs induce additional hospital healthcare resources which are not taken into account in the hospital payment system that is based on the nature and the quantity of medical activities performed (i.e. per-case payment system (PPS)). We assume that the current model of PPS represents an economic barrier to the use of OADs and which induces a disparity of access between oral and intravenous cancer treatments. The objective of this thesis was to determine the role of the PPS on the patient access to OADs based on a medico-economic evaluation of the economical and organizational impacts of OADs on the health care system. A literature review has highlighted the role of the funding of care on the access to OADs in the French and US healthcare systems. From an analysis of the national hospital database (PMSI database), we have quantified the economic implications of chemotherapy administration that is the second hospital activity in volume after hemodialysis. Earnings associated with chemotherapy sessions have been estimated at 108 million Euros in 2010 for all private and public institutions in France. This analysis also allowed us to simulate the transfer of resources allocation from hospital to community setting induced by the substitution of chemotherapy sessions by the use of OADs. A model comparing the cost of intravenous anticancer drug  (trastuzumab) to OADs (lapatinib and capecitabine) in the treatment of HER2+ metastatic breast cancer confirmed the lower costs for OADs (€ 17,165 versus € 36,077 per year per patient). The higher acquisition cost of OADs was offset by the cost savings in terms of medical transportation and hospital resources. Despite this negative budget impact for hospitals, a preference study (Discrete Choice Experiment) conducted among 203 physicians showed that the efficacy of cancer treatment remained the main determinant of the therapeutic decision (β=2.214, p&lt;0.0001). The study has also revealed that, in the advanced stages of cancer, the route of administration and its associated cost was also associated with the treatment choice (β=0.612, p= 0.035; =β0.506, p&lt;0.0001). Overall, the results show that the hospital payment system influences the choice of treatment modalities. Nonetheless, medical criterions related to the patient remain essential in the choice of using OADs  (clinical profile of the patient, adherence, patient preferences, familial and socio-economic environment, and conditions of access to health care)"
"The crisis of 2009 raised the question whether the financial conditions matter for the business cycles and the propagation of shocks originating in the financial sphere. I tried to drive a fine analysis of this issue using micro-founded general equilibrium models. The modelling choice was backed by empirical motivations. In three essays, i study the impact of monetary and financial shocks on growth and labour market dynamics. First, an expansionary monetary policy eases credit conditions, raises risk tolerance and the quality of borrowers and generates a liquidity effect. The potency of the monetary policy and the size of the credit channel depend considerably on the degree of financial frictions in the credit market. Second, a restrictive monetary policy shock, an positive credit shock and a positive uncertainty shocks have similar effects on the economy: they plunge the economy in a recession, with output, job creations, and hours worked decreasing, while unemployment and job destructions increase. In all cases the interest rate spread increase, therefore indicating that financial conditions deteriorate, which is interpreted as a sign that financial frictions play a critical role in the propagation of these shocks. Third, the interaction between financial and labour market frictions does exist. The interplay between the two indeed plays a role in propagating the shocks. A shock to net worth, a credit shock and an uncertainty shock play a non-trivial role for the dynamics on the labour market."
The subject of my PhD is The sustainability of capital accumulation and its regimes : a strong sustainability macroeconomic approach. It is composed of two parts. The first one is composed of two chapters that review the literature on two aspects : The first chapter tackles the debate on stationary capitalism. It reviews the way capitalism is taken into account by ecological economists and analyzes it in light of historical examples of ecological crises and of insights from eco-marxist theories. Chapter 2 tackles the debate about the so-called monetary growth imperative analysed from a post-Keynesian point of view. The second part is a more empirical one and is composed of three chapters. Chapter 3 attempts at framing the exergy-useful work approach into a régulationnist theoretical framework informed with insights from the Carbon democracy approach. It investigates the social relationship to energy in the Fordist and Neoliberal accumulation regimes. The fourth chapter attempts at furthering the third chapter by investigating the CO2 - GDP relationship through econometric means taking into account structural breaks between accumulation regimes and possible asymmetries. Chapter 5 investigates the commitment of countries to reduce their greenhousegas emissions within the context of globalized finance-led capitalism.
"The topic of corporate cash holdings has received relatively little attention from the academicresearchers. Yet, French firms hold significant cash reserves. This research aims to investigate,theoretically and empirically, the motivations and implications of the decision to hold cash.The first part of the thesis aims to provide a state of the art of the theories explaining corporate cashholding behavior. The second part seeks to empirically test these theories on a sample of 202 Frenchcompanies listed on the SBF 250. We first test the existence of an optimal level of liquid assets. Wesubsequently explore the advantages and disadvantages of holding cash before we examine the specific(financial and organizational) and macro-economic determinants of corporate cash levels. Finally, weestimate the impact of liquid assets on firms’ investment, performance and value and then we analyzethe moderating roles of financial constraints, corporate governance and macroeconomic conditions."
"The first chapter questions the conventional intuition that a high concentration of income at the top of the distribution should promote the emergence of rational asset bubbles. I use an OLG model with financial fictions and heterogeneous agents that differ in terms of savings rate, portfolio choices and skills. I show that a high concentration at the top promotes the emergence of asset bubbles if and only if those asset bubbles are illiquid or financial markets are arbitrage-free. Instead, if asset bubbles are liquid and liquid assets pay a premium under illiquid assets, a low concentration promotes the emergence of asset bubbles. The second chapter studies the circumstances under which asset bubbles are expansionary in an OLG-New Keynesian that includes capital. I show that secular stagnation is a necessary but not sufficient condition. Indeed, asset bubbles stimulate investment, consumption and output if and only if there's a strong shortage of aggregate demand. Finally, the third paper shows that ""standard"" New Keynesian models make puzzling predictions when aggregate demand is chronically deficient they predict a secular boom, and seeks to understand how those models must be adjusted to analyze secular stagnation. I emphasize the crucial role of the long run elasticities of asset demand and supply with respect to the output gap in general equilibrium; and I also connect the secular boom to other puzzling predictions of the New Keynesian model."
"In the process of globalization, the States released the exchanges and created the markets as wellcommercial as financial. Companies from now on exposed to a competition on the excellent levelof planet in technological innovations of production and marketing, information andcommunication. The State (Etat), the Market-Exchange and the Enterprise crystallize each one inthis new world, an institution. The existence of each one implies the existence of both others. Thistriple implication forms an original structure called « thirdness » (tierceité), said the « 3 E ». Theredefinition of the Enterprise as institution thus supposes the redefinition of the value that itcreates. This last cease to be the retrospective fixed value of a voluminal quantity. It becomes aprospective value moving of a quantified quality of integrated strategic management. Newcountable rules regulate this one : widened international countable standards. These rules requirefor the enterprises those dimensions to produce a value of regeneration and breeding or « profit »aligned on a constant purchasing power. With this intention, integrated strategic managementimplies new behaviors of management. Those give up traditional arithmetic calculation founded onthe addition and the subtraction to replace them by a heuristic method of calculation ofrelations : « Conditional Normative Accounting Method ». These new behaviors of managementmobilized by this heuristic method to ensure the new value moving and prospective become the« account » of the accounting IFRS of the Enterprise whose finality is of: « to measure the realityof the predictive richness to remember » (in reference to the Exchange aiming at the Value), « tomeasure to act » (in reference to the Enterprise aiming at the Activity) and « to measure to divide »(in reference to the State (Etat) aiming at the Live well-offness together)."
"Financial scandals around the world have pushed researchers in recent years to thinkabout corporate governance issue. And good governance practices of companies have beenestablished in order to protect entrepreneurs and sustain these for the welfare of all.Therefore, the company's control with governance would be a priority for those who put theircapital. However, these best practices have not always proven successful because of thecontext or the application environment is not the same. Our results of logistic regression showdifferent controls to Cameroonian companies negatively correlated to the contextualelements (corruption, interpersonal relations, cronyism, blind obedience, tribalism, etc.) incontrast to Western companies."
"This thesis aims to determine the influence of contingency factors on the utility of balanced scorecards in the performance management of ISEs. To achieve this objective, the literature review has allowed, on the one hand, to understand the main theoretical concepts used in this work and, on the other hand, to present a research framework which is the cornerstone of our theoretical model. From a hypothetical-deductive methodology and a positivist position, an explanatory model of the utility of balanced scorecards in the performance management of ISEs is developed. The latter incorporates one dependent variable which explains the ""utility of balanced scorecards in the performance management"", ten explanatory variables and one mediating variable ""diversity of use of BSC indicators"".Then, this model is tested on 156 ISEs established in France. The data collected is examined using the principal components analysis and the multiple linear regression method. The results of this quantitative study expose contingency factors explaining the utility of BSC in the performance management. Thus, this thesis enriches the previous theoretical works on the challenges of measuring performance, and practically, provides CFOs and management controllers with an explanatory framework of the new practices of ISEs’ performance management."
"This thesis studies the Tunisian banking sector and why it is characterized by large volumes of nonperformantloans. Based on a sample of 11 commercial listed banks during 2009-2011, we examinethe impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on credit risk. Our results reveal thedeficiency of these governance mechanisms.From the appearance of new attempts to explain bank failures by the contribution of behavioralfinance, we try to identify the role of overconfidence in the reckless credit policy. Our results showthat overconfidence recent worsening Non Performants Loans of Tunisian banks.In order to deepen our research, it seems interesting to check the impact of overconfidence on bankers’risk-taking behavior. We extend our work with an experimental study to detect the impact ofoverconfidence on the banker’s risk-taking behavior. Our results of multinomial logistic regressionsshow that banker’s overconfidence evolves with experience and influences negatively his credit risktakingbehavior."
"Short-term financing is forgotten by theory of corporate finance. However, French medium-sized firms use a lot this source of funding. The objective of this thesis is to analyze the determinants of short-term financing for these firms. The first part aims to establish a literature review of theories to explain the use of short-term financing. The second part empirically checks these theories on two samples, specifically 201 family businesses and 1,453 managerial firms. On the one hand, it is a question of characterizing the unlisted medium-sized enterprises and on the other hand, highlighting the determinants of the use of short-term financing. The primary results indicate that short-term financing is a management tool for the medium-sized enterprise. It can also have two functions, one compensatory and / or one passive cash. Furthermore, it brings out that managerial and family businesses exploit short-term financing differently."
"Contagion phenomenon, efficiency hypothesis and spillover effects are amongst the most important economic theories as they provide an overall vision of the  financial stability, yet the least understood in the aftermath of the recent crises. This thesis proposes to provide policy makers, investors and broadly market participants with an updated outlook of the dynamic behavior of the global sovereign Credit Default Swaps (CDS) markets: informational efficiency, interaction with other international financial markets and systemic-risk exposure. The steadily changing dynamics of these markets combined with the constantly evolving regulatory policies have led to a shared worldwide enthusiasm regarding the behavioral study of CDS markets, in which we contribute through five interconnected essays. We first discuss, in the first essay, the statistical characteristics of the sovereign CDS data, through the estimation of 9 GARCH-class models. This chapter compares the predictability performances of several linear and non-linear volatility models taking into consideration different financial stylized facts. Application on CDS spreads of 38 countries reveals that the forecasting power of these models depends on their ability to capture sovereign CDS features while  estimating the variance process. Yet, the fractionally-integrated models outperform the basic GARCH-class models due to the allowed flexibility regarding the persistence degree of the variance shocks. These results are used to jointly model returns and volatility of CDS spreads in the forthcoming essays.The second essay also investigates the financial characteristics of the international sovereign CDS markets, by giving new evidences on their efficiency degrees. Using a new framework based on a 3-step estimation of a VECM-FIGARCH model, we show that information contained in CDS spreads and bond yields are not always instantaneously and properly reflected in the current sovereign risk level. Results reveal the existence of arbitrage opportunities  with a partial rejection of the randomness hypothesis in some of the 37 studied countries. While the previous essay used the conditional expectation of CDS spreads to study the market behavior, the next essays rather focus on the properties of the variance and covariance. The predictability of sovereign CDS volatility, based on the information contained in some country-specific and global macroeconomic factors, is investigated in the third chapter [etc...]"
"This proposed thesis uses the Haar wavelets to create new technical indicators, to evaluate their performance in order to test the validity of the weak form of efficient market hypothesis. The chosen approach aims to implement the capabilities of technical indicators to capture the long memory present in the US and European stock indices through the estimation of the trend by the smoothing process. Moreover, the trend is an important component in the economic and financial series. Indeed, it has been the subject of innumerable investigations in technical analysis, in signal processing and in the theory business cycle theory. However, its presence is not taken into account in the classic theory of finance because the main models used focus on changes in stock prices. For this purpose, the trend constitutes a source of non-stationarity leading to major difficulties for econometric or financial modeling. Exploit trend is freed, in this case, from the hypotheses of tendancy or unit root. In addition, the issue of the results we obtained from the regime change model. We confirm that it is possible to exploit the presence of long memory in the series, and also to beat the market in the presence of transaction costs on the American and European markets."
"This thesis aims to help better understand role conflicts experienced by female statutory auditors. These role conflicts and the way they are managed are analysed in a specific professional and relational context: that of interactions with the client. This thesis is presented in the form of a qualitative field study combining three methods of collecting data: non participative observations, semi-directed interviews and life history. Our sample includes female auditors working in Big 4 firms and medium or small sized firms, as well as male and female clients. It reveals six roles taken on by female auditors, including that of sexual object, absent from accounting research. Interactions with clients can reactivate role conflict experienced within the firms, generate new ones, inhibit or even suppress some of them.  It identifies two inter-role conflicts arising from a co-construction of meaning between the female auditor and the client. It also reveals two kinds of role conflict management which are not mutually exclusive. The first is composed of six adaptative interactional tactics which reinforce an established order of gender and where women are both victims and agents of their condition. A typology of these adaptative interactional tactics is proposed. The second, which could be qualified as radical, comes from a deep questioning of the professional role defined by audit firms. It consists of a reinterpretation of the professional role of female auditors. It envisages the reconciliation of both masculine and feminine modes of interaction with the client. Differences in termes of conflict roles and role conflict management are identified between female auditors working in Big 4 firms and female auditors working in medium or small sized firms."
"The issue of inclusive development in developing countries is at the heart of this thesis. The latter revolves around four chapters on fiscal policy issues and inclusive growth-related matters. Chapter 1 explores how government tax policy affects the inclusiveness of growth in developing countries. Evidence is shown that tax policy affects significantly inclusive growth if and only if the countries have a strong institution quality like low corruption and a good bureaucratic policy. In addition, our result shows that there is an optimal tax beyond which, any increase in the personal income tax rate should have negative impact on inclusive growth. The Chapter 2 examines the effects of government expenditure components on both equity and growth in sub-Saharan countries, especially whether it is possible to design public spending to promote a more equitable society without sacrificing economic growth. We find that investment in infrastructure contributed to more inclusive growth in Sub-sub Saharan African economies than others government spending. These results suggest that temporary and well-targeted programs should be implemented to help those being left out by the growth process. The Chapter 3 investigates whether income inequality matters in the periods of fiscal adjustments in Côte d’Ivoire over the period 1980-2014. The results show an improvement in growth performance after fiscal consolidations episodes, but also income gap decreases in the periods ahead fiscal adjustments. Lastly, Chapter 4 assesses the credibility of fiscal forecasts and their social effects in CEMAC and WAEMU countries. We obtain evidence that the inefficiency of fiscal forecast occurs in most time because the forecast deviation is proportional to the forecast itself, but also because the past errors are repeated in the present. Furthermore, a part of revenue forecast errors can be explained by random shocks to the economy. Therefore, these errors in revenue forecast considered as fiscal policy shocks has a detrimental effect on inclusive growth."
"Family businesses are organizations in which family participation characterizes management, control and ownership, representing a significant proportion of global organizations and a large percentage of GDP for multiple countries. For example, in Latin America, it is estimated that 90 to 98% of all companies are family, constituting 80% of all jobs. In the case of Ecuador, more than 80% of the companies are family members, under the definition that members of the founder's family or the same founder, continue in the administration, control or management of the firm, there being 55,130 registered in the Superintendence of Companies, with an equity of some USD 25,976 million, a contribution to the country's GDP of 51% and the generation of 1.6 million jobs (Price Waterhouse Coopers, 2018).Data from the Global Family Business Survey- Ecuador 2018 report that they represent 90%, where 77% already have the following generations working for the business and participate in the sectors: trade, professional activities, real estate, construction, transportation, manufacturing and services and agriculture.Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are recognized as a key driver of economic development, which has been the source of political debates around the world (Liedholm et al., 1994, Robson et al., 2009, Abor and Quartey, 2010), resulting in both developed and developing countries focusing on these companies for the benefits they can bring in terms of job creation and income generation (Hallberg, 1999, Acs and Szerb, 2007, Kang and Heshmati, 2008).These companies are so different in terms of origin, structure, organization and direction, in addition to the fact that the few existing studies in Ecuador frequently do not broaden the vision of the company beyond the second generation and do not address the motivations of the entrepreneurial act, in This research is based on the deepening of a broad theoretical framework, involving cognitive, organizational and behavioral social theories, to propose the problem in the form of a research question: What are the motivations of the entrepreneur of the Ecuadorian family SME that can configure a typology of the entrepreneurial act and its impact on business management?The general objective of the research is to know the typology of the Ecuadorian entrepreneur, in terms of the motivations and the illustrative variables that most characterize them, and their impact on the management of family SMEs.For the specific objectives, the following are defined: determine the conceptual theoretical elements that allow defining Ecuadorian family businesses, as well as the most important attributes or variables that can be included in a typology for entrepreneurs of family SMEs in Ecuador; establish the main characteristics of personal, family and professional context, as well as, the motivations for the entrepreneurial act, of the managers of the family SMEs of Ecuador; Determine the main factors that are part of the business management and achievement of objectives of the managers of family SMEs in Ecuador and finally relate the typology of the Ecuadorian entrepreneur with the management models of family SMEs.For the methodology a quantitative, hypothetical - deductive methodological approach is adopted, with a correlational scope, which - after reviewing the state of the art - allows to establish initial questions from which hypotheses are derived whose logical consequences are subjected to empirical corroboration, through a exhaustive process of data collection and statistical analysis.Based on the database of the Superintendency of Companies of Ecuador, which reports 27,532 active family SMEs, a simple random sample of 1,000 companies was selected to which they were sent by email a first survey-typology of the entrepreneur and another second survey - management model. The data was processed using descriptive statistics, principal components analysis and correlation analysis."
"In Latin America, specifically in ecuador dominates family businesses being estimated at 90% under the definition that members of the family of the founder or the same founder continue in administration, control or management, finding 55,130 registered in the Superintendence of Companies, with an equity of some USD 25,976 million, a contribution to the country's GDP of 51% and the generation of 1.6 million jobs.Data from the Global Family Business Survey- Ecuador 2018, highlights that 43% of these companies are single-product companies and 77% have the following generations working in the firm.According to Camino-Mogro & Bermúdez-Barrezueta (2018), these companies represent 85%, being the microenterprises the largest number, followed by SMEs and large companies. One of the most important challenges of the Ecuadorian family business is related to generational transmission, given that less than 2% maintains a succession plan and only some have a Family Council (Price Waterhouse Coopers, 2018), together with the few Existing studies often do not broaden the vision of the company beyond the second generation and do not address the influence of gender in the process of succession.Starting from the deepening in a broad theoretical framework, in which we imply cognitive, organizational and behavioral social theories, we propose our problem in the form of a research question: What is the influence of gender in the decision making of the predecessor-founder to choose the successor in the family business?To understand the effect of gender in the designation of the successor, the following research objectives were specified. Among them is to describe the individual factors of the predecessor-founder conditioning the process of succession in the family business; Categorize the motivations or components that influence the generation of commitment of the possible successors in the family business and finally explain the effects of gender in succession planning, valuing family composition, primogeniture and the role of women [...]."
"This work examines the nature and effects of integrating marketing logic into arts and culture organizations. The research aims to update and extend the knowledge acquired about the “conflict” between artists and managers exposed by Chiapello (1998) while orienting it towards the conflict between artists and marketers. As part of a comprehensive approach, this work is based on the case method. A qualitative exploratory study consisting of 17 interviews precedes the realization of 5 case studies, conducted at the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF), the Bibliothèque publique d’information (Bpi), the Musée national d’art moderne Centre Pompidou (MNAM), the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal (MBAM) and the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec (BAnQ). The implementation of the case studies is based on significant immersion periods in the institutions mentioned; during these periods semi-structured interviews and observations were collected and analyzed. In addition, this research led to a comparative France-Canada analysis. In addition to the report on the actuality of the conflict established, the thesis proposes ways to write an effective integration of marketing in cultural organizations."
"This thesis explores two questions about fuel poverty in France: What indicator(s) should be adopted to quantify fuel poverty and capture its multiple dimensions? To what extent does ecological taxation amplify the phenomenon or, on the contrary, provides an opportunity to fight it?A first chapter introduces the social and economic issues of fuel poverty in France, as well as the challenges this phenomenon raises for public actors in the context of an ecological transition (chapter 1). Then the thesis is divided into two main parts.The first part deals with the measurement of fuel poverty. I start by highlighting the current debates on the measurement of fuel poverty and the limitations of existing approaches (chapter 2). Next, I explore the transport dimension of fuel poverty and I propose a composite index of the various factors that constrain household mobility and their possibilities to adapt to higher fuel prices. This index identifies three levels of exposure to rising fuel prices: precariousness, vulnerability and dependence (chapter 3). I then continue studying the design of a multidimensional index of energy poverty and I seek to uncover its political implications. Two indices are developed: one for housing and one for transport. I show how these new indices, through addressing the cumulative factors that disadvantage households in terms of energy, can help limit the inclusion and exclusion errorsfrom which conventional approaches suffer. Quantification in the French context brings new insights on the targeting of policy responses and emphasizes the need to address the non-monetary dimensions of fuel poverty (chapter 4).  The second part studies the distributive impacts of carbon taxation. Based on a review of literature, I discuss the methodological issues and the modelling choices to represent the distribution of impacts (chapter 5). I then develop a microsimulation model to assess the impact of the French carbon tax on households. This model simulates, for a representative sample of the French population, the taxes levied on their energy consumption in housing and transport. I use this model to quantify the impact of the carbon tax on inequality and fuel poverty. Finally, I explore different scenarios of redistribution of carbon tax revenues to households, with the objective to correct the found inequities - in particular, to compensate for the regressivity of the carbon tax and to reduce fuel poverty. I evaluate the cost of these measures in respect to the amount of carbon tax revenues (chapter 6)."
"The evaluation of money endogeneity reveals the complex arrangements that form a banking structure and its ability to create money through credit. In this regard, the key features of the Post-Keynesian structuralist approach of money supply are : (i) money is mostly created in the credit market ; and (ii) monetary authorities impose some limits to credit creation, however, they do not entirely determine its process. Hereof, both money demand and liquidity preference of agents (banks, firms and consumers) are the underlying forces that sustain these two attributes. The thesis investigates what has determined credit money supply in Brazil and how monetary policy has bounded this process after the adoption of the inflation targeting regime in 1999. We, first, outline the intrinsic characteristics of money supply in a monetary economy of production by addressing the Post-Keynesian structuralist theory on the subject. Thereafter, we focus on the current dominant academic thinking that guides the formulation of monetary policies for numerous Central Banks by almost three decades, i.e. the New Consensus in Macroeconomics (NCM), and assess its divergences to the Post-Keynesian approach. Following, we highlight the extensive debate that the 2007-2009 financial crisis brought among theorists, pointing to the alternative Post-Keynesian view of both monetary policy and credit and business cycles. After the theoretical argumentation, Brazilian monetary policy objectives and instruments are investigated in order to gather the most important elements that shall constraint bank’s credit money creation. Finally, we enlighten the path of credit supply in Brazil from 1999 to 2016, where both the changes in the financial system and in the balance sheet of banks are analyzed. We ultimately estimate a dynamic panel data model and a VECM model using data from the balance sheets of the fifty largest banks in the country for the period under investigation. We thus find evidences that the money supply has an ascending relation with the interest rate, and, therefore, it is neither horizontal nor vertical, but rather, respond to the liquidity preference of banks. Hence, the thesis contributes to the construction of a more accurate discussion of the endogeneity of money supply in Brazil, widening the understanding of the imposed restrictions of monetary policy to the banking system."
"Consultancy services have been developing continuously for several decades and the client-consultant relationship appears according to the work in management sciences as an essential explanatory factor of their performance. This literature review shows that the topic of consulting remains underdeveloped, especially in France, and that it will require significant development in the coming years, including through the change in environments and professional practices. Furthermore, most of the studies focus on the consultant and rather little on the advisory relationship. Thus our work aims to contribute to a better understanding of what it is and its dynamics.In this research, we propose to use the contributions of the current of pragmatic sociology and translation sociology (ANT: Actor Network Theory) in order to define the process of the consultancy relationship. Through a qualitative approach, we identified a model of the consulting relationship, called LES (Listening, Support, Ethic) describing its three main attributes (called ""essential attributes"") in the process of translating the consulting relationship.The managerial contribution is significant because it concerns the actors of consulting (strategy consulting, management, operational and also chartered accountants and auditors) and almost all companies of all sizes that call upon or can solicit a service provider to support them in their activities."
"We take the wage posting approach with search friction to study three issues in labor market. The first issue concerns the premature quitting of workers. Our framework is suitable for contexts such as disability shock, retirement, maternity leaves etc. Such premature quitting creates turnover risks for firms, hence the firms propose wage profiles to minimize or avoid it. In this issue, the asymmetric information plays an important role. We adopt an approach of mechanism design and consider different timings at which the private information is realized. In a follow-up paper, we propose an age-directed policy by which this inefficiency can be alleviated and study its implication on welfare and aggregate output. In the second issue, we revisit welfare analysis of impact of discrimination on skill choice under a multi-dimensional hiring norm along both productivity-related and -unrelated characteristics. We show how strategic skill investment between favored and discriminated group arise. We compare also two wage determination mechanisms (posted and bargained wage). In the third issue, we consider to which extent can the roles of unemployment benefit and minimum wage correct inefficient allocations arising from firms’ market power. Our context concerns small markets where the workers/firms ratio is not large. The market imperfection comes from the fact that in such a small market firms pay less than competitive level of wages. We proceed from an industrial organizational perspective and suggest focusing on both misallocation of labor and surplus when analyzing the effectiveness of the policy instrument."
"Tourism has become the leading economic sector in Bali Province of Indonesia. However, the economic impacts of tourism have not been convinced to be full y beneficial for Balinese community. One of the reasons is tourism leakage that occurs when the industry imports both products and services to support tourism industry in Bali. So far, the amount of tourism leakage in Bali has not been calculated yet. Therefore, there is a need to ascertain the current amount of leakage in Bali tourism. The objectives of the study are: (i) to calculate the amount of tourism leakage from accommodation sector in Bali at micro (industrial) level; (ii) to calculate the amount of tourism leakage from accommodation sector in Bali at macro (regional) level; (iii) to evaluate the impacts of government subsidies and import reduction by accommodation sector on tourism leakage, job opportunity and income distribution; (iv) to evaluate the perception and preference of foreign tourists on imported and local products as well as the willingness of foreign tourists to spend their money to benefit of Balinese people; (v) to evaluate the points of view of hotel managers related to imported and local products as well as their willingness in reducing the use of imported product and (vi) to develop strategies in minimizing tourism leakage in accommodation in Bali. Research was designed through quantitative and qualitative approaches. Data was collected by using survey method at four main tourist destinations in Bali, namely: Kuta, Nusa Dua, Sanur and Ubud. There were 79 hotels selected based upon probability proportional to size sampling method which consists of three clusters namely 1,2,3 Star-rated, 4&5 Star-rated either chain and non-chain and Non Star-rated hotels. The number of respondents was 600 foreign tourists were selected as respondents. Calculation of tourism leakage on micro analysis was undertaken by using a method developed by Unluonen, et. al. (2011), meanwhile, on macro analysis was carried out by using a method proposed by Thorbecke ( 1988) which was based on the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) of Bali 2010. Perception and preference of foreign tourists on imported and local products were analyzed by using JMP program, meanwhile, Interpretative Structural Modelling (ISM) was undertaken to develop strategies. The results show that based on the micro analysis, the highest tourism leakage of accommodation sector in Bali is at 4&5 Star-rated chain hotels (51.0 %), followed by 4&5 Star-rated non-chain hotels (22.7 %), 1,2&3 Star-rated hotels (12.0 %), Non-star rated hotels (8.8 %), and with the average leakage of 18.8 %. Based on macro analysis, tourism leakage of accommodation sector in Bali are as follow: (i) Leakage of Non Star-rated hotels is 2.0 %; (ii) Leakage of 1,2&3 Star-rated hotels is 15.7 %; (iii) Leakage of 4&5 Star-rated non-chain hotels is 7.1 %, (iv) Leakage of 4&5 Star-rated chain hotels is 55.3%; and (v) Average leakage of all types of accommodation is 19.5%. Foreign tourists significantly look for local products and are willing to spend their money for Balinese people. Hotel managers are willing to use local product as long as local products are available to substitute the imported products. Strategies for minimization tourism leakage are optimizing the potential of local products, develop agriculture and livestock; reduce the use of imported products for tourists, improve quality of local products and human resources, empower community, urge government to develop and implement supporting policies in minimizing tourism leakage, establish policy on restriction of foreign investment on accommodation in Bali, improve the role of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Trade and Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. 7 Ps of marketing mix on service: product, price, place, promotion, people, process and physical evidence need to be implemented in order to support sustainable tourism in Bali"
"Impacts of the global rise of housing price from 1980s on the economy has attracted a surging research interest. As housing represent a major share of household expenditure as well as total wealth, it’s important to understand the role of housing on wealth inequality. Yet, due to data availability, little has been done to understand this issue. As wealth of households is accumulated from two main sources: capital savings and transfers, it’s important to understand how these sources are linked to housing market when there’s a shift in housing prices. Thus, the first two chapters of this thesis aim to a better understanding on the importance of housing channel on the economy. More specifically, the first chapter draws attention on the co-movement between housing prices and production output. By introducing different shocks to the economy, we can analyse their impacts on housing prices and capital accumulation as well as the mechanism in which these shocks are transmitted. On the other hand, the second chapter focuses on how intergenerational transfer makes inequality persistent via the housing market. By considering an economy with two different investment assets: housing and capital, we show that that there exists an equilibrium in which housing is more profitable than capital. As the rich family, i.e. the one who inherited relatively higher wealth, can access the housing market while the poor one can’t due to the borrowing constraint, inequality maintains in the long run. Furthermore, bequest and intrahousehold transfer are the two essential transmission channels that link to wealth in different way. While intrahousehold transfer is believed to contribute to the development of individual’s human capital and hence labour incomes, inheritance plays a decisive role in one’s accumulation of capital and wealth. Data from the national transfer account in France showed us that over the last decades, there has been a notable change in a composition of private transfers: from a more dominant share of intrahousehold transfers to a more dominant inheritance one. As this shift triggers two adverse effects, it’s therefore interesting to understand why and how it happens as well as how it is related to wealth inequality. These questions are addressed in the third chapter of my thesis."
"Since the reference model was developed by Allingham and Sandmo (1972), the problems linked ta tax evasion and particularly ta the relationship between the reasons for tax compliance, and the amount of declared income have often been studied. The taxpayer's decision depends primarily on the amount of his real income, on the tax rate, on the probability of control and on the amount of the fines in the case of identified fraud. However, other parameters more psychological than economical arc also taken into account ta identify the social climate in which the taxpayer evolves, the use of their tax contributions by the government, the social norms, or simply the awareness of the duty taxes in order ta support public projects and fiscal public­spiritedness. These facts have not yet been taken into consideration in developing countries like Madagascar. Tax evasion is linked to the incapacity of tax authorities to ensure full control of the system due to a lack of means as well as phenomena such as com1ption, the increasing presence of the informal sector and the influence of the political decision makers. Empirical studies have shown that Value-Added Tax remains the most defraudcd tax by taxpayers and that the annual lasses due to tax evasion are exorbitant, totaling around € 203 million from 2007 to 2009 in the centers participating in the survey."
"The French ecosystem of audiovisual production has been structured by the liberalization of state television (1984-1986). Radio frequencies were granted to broadcasters in exchange for a commitment to invest a percentage of their turnover into French production. The result is a heavily regulated system whose rules have changed very little in thirty years. This industrial organization is showing its limits: the market share of French films in theaters is stagnant, while the audience is aging. The profitability of TV-channels crumbles and series they finance don't sell. The entry of foreign platforms such as Netflix fragments the audience even more. The purpose of this thesis is to study the creation of the industrial ecosystem of the French Television, its evolution and the impact of the entry of international players on the incumbents' strategies and on regulation."
"Risk management and corporate social responsibility took roles play how to manage global supply chain energy efficiency strategy and international logistics. All is based on facts-simulations, causes & impacts in transportation, production, and warehouse management”. In term of transportation in global supply chain shows for tracking performance systems hould be applied on appropriate standardized. Particularly for hazardous products. So that, the pollution level can be anticipated and calculated in exact level. The most important one is also the external level, so called leadership factor. This factor will reflect the corporate social responsibility performance.The type of production system which connected to global supply chain system is the most difficult one. Why do we have difficulties on this one? Because, some enterprises or countries for some extent could not make a better choice in term of scarcity for certain type of energy resources. For the warehouse section, the author found the result that electricity sector with real time data base has been giving realistic the way of energy efficiency of global supply chain.The energy efficiency in global supply chain is a perspective that efficiency energy in global level could be perform by any type of product, mainly on energy matter. By focusing on how to transport them, the way of production system, and how to build up warehouse system to keep source of energy become more efficient to serve end users."
"In 2004, the french plea bargaining called the Comparution sur Reconnaissance Préalable de Culpabilité (CRPC) is introduced. With vocation to be faster and less expensive than a lawsuit, it has as the ambition to reduce the number of cases on correctional courts. Since its enforcement, there have been reserves to apply this process. The main fear is to see French justice slipping towards drifts similar to those known in the United States. Many interrogations raised concerning its effectiveness and its equity have been renewed recently by the proposal of the Leger committee to extend its application to crimes. We seek to discuss the debate on the potentially undesirable effects of plea bargaining, in general, and of the CRPC, in particular. The economic analysis of plea bargaining proposed in this thesis has two objectives. The first objective is to examine how the sanction inflicted in plea bargaining can be effective to reduce the legal errors and/or to deterrence people to commit an offence. An original approach of the literature is carried out. In fact, we insist on two aspects of the effectiveness of plea bargaining : revelation of information and the deterrence. We thus highlight useful conclusions on the effectiveness of the CRPC in its current state of application and on its effects to await if its applicability is widened. In particular, the economic literature recommends to maintain a sentence sorrow to the judgement, to grant to the prosecutor a available budget and to introduce sentencing guidelines. These conclusion are opposed to the characteristics of plea bargaining : lightest sentence, decreasing the costs of justice and individualization of the sentence. The second objective of this thesis is to examine the equity of plea bargaining. Indeed, although the reproach of iniquity was frequently formulated in France and in the United States against this procedure, the economic literature did not study this question. In order to bring answers to the legal debates, two distinct analyses are carried out. First, we examine the impact of the fees system of the attorney on the sentence. We show that a two-speed justice is developed. Secondly, with a personal database, we discuss the CRPC equity using an econometric study. We highlight that the court plays an essential part in the type of sentence inflicted with the defendant."
"Improving the performance of medico-social sector requires management tools capable of quickly and synthetically provide a clear and quantified view of activities towards the users. Unfortunally, today does not exist a satisfactory tools to control activities in each structure, as neither at the level of the managing organization. The object of the research work is to develop tools to aid management and monitoring of activities in the medico-social sector in order to improve the current vision of the medico-social sector too compartmentalized. Closely related to Ressourcial (former information system department of OVE Foundation), this work is part of a CIFRE thesis and is one of the first theses of engineering sciences that address to organizational problems in the medical-social sector. The first scientific challenge of this research is to propose a formal and structured approach to monitoring activities in these institutions. The proposed approach should be able to realize a typology of activities in a very broad spectrum; activities performed by institutions with operating modes, and business cultures, highly heterogeneous. On this aspect, the scientist lock of this work is that the aggregation on the same model, intrinsically heterogeneous operating modes. The second scientific challenge of this thesis is the development of innovative approaches for analyzing these monitoring data and to aid management of these structures from the same data."
"Policy instruments on passenger vehicle emissions aim at reducing negative environmental externalities from vehicles use. To regulate CO2 emissions, fuel economy standards have been put in place in Europe and in the US, among others. These standards are made more stringent over time. This thesis analyzes how automotive firms anticipate and prepare their future technology portfolio to comply with expected future standards. To do so, we develop a model of optimal technology choice that captures technology diffusion constraints.With this framework, this thesis investigates three policy questions. First, we ask how the form of anticipation can affect near- and long-term technology choices. We find that focusing solely on near-term objectives can lead to failure to comply with a long-term target. In fact, meeting the near-term target is not a necessary nor a sufficient condition to satisfy long-term compliance. Moreover, when there is partial anticipation, as in a myopic view of the future, technology choices will be stuck with low abatement technologies creating a path dependency that limits long-term abatement potential.Second, we ask how much indexing fuel economy standard to mass (as in Europe or China)  changes the optimal technology. We show that, for the same emission target, there is no significant difference in the social cost of mobility for an average vehicle with and without mass index. Thus a heavier vehicle fleet has the same cost than a lighter one. However, the technology choices are different, and mass indexed fuel economy standards lead to sidestepping  lightweight technologies despite being cost effective from a CO2 emissions abatement point of view.Third, we ask how technology choices change when policies with multiple objectives overlap. We focus on two externalities associated with mobility: CO2 emissions and local air pollution. We show three type of effects of overlapping policies. First, a technology specific policy such as the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate in combination with a fuel economy standard induces carmakers to develop more expensive green technologies and prevents cheap, dirty technologies from disappearing compared to the case of a fuel economy standard alone. Second, the combination of policies can lead to very high costs when technologies adapted to each policy are very different. Third, we find an ambiguous effect of overlapping policies relative to single-objective policy in terms of emissions performance."
"The Internet technology and the web economy create new types of markets and new relationships between market players. The majority of these new markets can be associated to platforms where two or more sides of the same market meet. Such “multi-sided” industries raise specific issues. Determining the optimal pricing strategy for both the platform and the users selling goods through the platform is one of the main challenges of this new economy. The first two chapters of my thesis analysis Price Parity Agreement (PPA) from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. I first study the effect of Price Parity Agreements from a theoretical perspective. I demonstrate that PPAs on the online booking market are detrimental to consumers if platforms have most of the bargaining power. They attenuate competition between platforms, lead to higher commission fees and higher hotel rooms’ prices. However, MFN clauses may also be welfare improving when hotels own the bargaining power and competition between them is high. The second chapter is dedicated to an empirical analysis of the effects of PPAs. Using a before-after design and controlling for external shocks, I demonstrate that the end of Price Parity Agreements imposed by public authorities to OTAs causes a decrease of about 3.1% to 4.5% in the average level of prices set by hotels. This decrease may be explained by an increase of price discrimination. I show that the level of price discrimination across OTAs increases by 2.3% to 1.4% after the drop of Price Parity Agreements and that the degree of inter-temporal price discrimination also increases by 3.6% to 2.1%. The last chapter of my thesis is focused on the analysis of the financial fines imposed by the French Autorité de la Concurrence to cartels in France between 2006 and 2018. We show that the level of these fines is sub-optimal and doesn’t meet the deterrence objective in the majority of the cases."
"In recent years, security in Information Systems (IS) has become an important issue that needs to be taken into account in all stages of IS development, including the early phase of Requirement Engineering (RE). Considering security during early stages of IS development allows IS developers to envisage threats, their consequences and countermeasures before a system is in place. Security requirements are known to be “the most difficult of requirements types”, and potentially the ones causing the greatest risk if they are not correct. Moreover, requirements engineers are not primarily interested in, or knowledgeable about, security. Their tacit knowledge about security and their primitive knowledge about the domain for which they elicit security requirements make the resulting security requirements poor and too generic. This thesis explores the approach of eliciting requirements based on the reuse of explicit knowledge. First, the thesis proposes an extensive systematic mapping study of the literature on the reuse of knowledge in security requirements engineering identifying the different knowledge forms. This is followed by a review and classification of security ontologies as the main reuse form. In the second part, AMAN-DA is presented. AMAN-DA is the method developed in this thesis. It allows the elicitation of domain-specific security requirements of an information system by reusing knowledge encapsulated in domain and security ontologies. Besides that, the thesis presents the different elements of AMANDA: (I) a core security ontology, (II) a multi-level domain ontology, (III) security goals and requirements’ syntactic models, (IV) a set of rules and mechanisms necessary to explore and reuse the encapsulated knowledge of the ontologies and produce security requirements specifications. The last part reports the evaluation of the method. AMAN-DA was implemented in a prototype tool. Its feasibility was evaluated and applied in case studies of three different domains (maritime, web applications, and sales). The ease of use and the usability of the method and its tool were also evaluated in a controlled experiment. The experiment revealed that the method is beneficial for the elicitation of domain specific security requirements, and that the tool is friendly and easy to use."
"Vehicle-to-Anything (V2X) is an umbrella term to explain the use of electric vehicle batteries to derive additional value during times of non-use. V2X services generate revenue from the battery asset through dynamic mono-directional (V1X) or bi-directional (V2X) charging to provide benefits to the electric grid, to reduce energy consumption of buildings and homes, or to provide back-up power to loads. A meta-analysis of economic potential gives results contradictory to the literature and indicates that Bill Management, Resource Adequacy, and Network Deferral are more valuable than Energy Arbitrage and Spinning Reserves. While I concur that development is of and by the market, I emphasize that V2X will develop within the constraints of the regulatory environment; therefore regulators have an enabling role to play.An important question is to what extent additional use of the vehicle battery will affect battery capacity over its lifetime, therefore understanding the intricacies of battery degradation is crucial to estimate costs. Li-ion batteries are complicated electrochemical systems which exhibit two concurrent degradation phenomena, Calendar Aging and Cycling Aging. In vehicular applications, Calendar Aging tends to be the dominating life degradation effect, which reduces to time being the most important component of degradation; therefore degradation cost is fundamentally time-dependent.A central claim of this dissertation is that gls{v2x} Marginal Cost is not zero nor negligible as the economic literature has accepted but is highly dependent on battery degradation. Herein, a gls{v2x} Marginal Cost Theory is proposed which is based on two main principles: 1.) there is an efficiency cost associated with charge operation, and 2.) the true gls{v2x} degradation cost takes opportunity cost into account, that is, only considers degradation beyond what would have been experienced by operating the vehicle normally.Having a clear concept of gls{v2x} Marginal Cost which can properly account for and balance all true costs: the cost of electricity, the system-efficiency costs, and battery degradation, will allow for development of optimal charge strategies and will properly inform energy market bids. This results in a more nuanced understanding of marginal costs as the resultant battery lifetime impact from gls{v2x} can be either be considered a cost, a benefit, or zero. I conclude that gls{v2x} may offer greater economic value than previously understood and that this additional value will be realized through the simultaneous improvement in charge efficiency and reduction of gls{ev} battery degradation."
"In the context of closed inbound innovation, as a form of open innovation practice, the quality of coordination among employees takes an important place. Innovative ideas can appear at any moment of the numerous formal and informal conversations. Concept generation is a key moment of upstream innovation processes. Thanks to internal web-platforms, in many organizations employees are integrated within the innovation processes and often, community discussions are organized on-line. We carry an empirical exploration by analyzing on-line, innovation-oriented, web community discussions that we have had the opportunity to co-animate throughout collaboration with a consulting firm. The innovation-oriented online discussions were launched in the context of an online community of employees to allow its members to go beyond daily discussions and further explore one trend or opportunity for the group.  In this dissertation, we explore the dynamic of online collaborative concept generation at ideation stage. Therefore, we present three sets of results: firstly, we describe the general conversational dynamics of online innovation-oriented discussions, secondly contextualized community management practices, then the collaborative dynamics of concept generation. Finally, we try to establish a general framework enabling the analysis of an online innovation-oriented conversation. This research leads us to further discuss the links between open innovation platforms and the innovation organization."
"Deregulation of electricity market has displayed many changes in the economy and has influenced researchers to initiate studies in this field. The issue of the deregulated arises as the volatility of the wholesale price increases because of the new mechanism in price determination. Italy provides an interesting case study for exploring the electricity market because of its specifications. Our project consists of three independent quantitative research to view the Italian electricity market in three different angles. The first study is aimed to address the forecasting issue caused by the volatility of electricity market. The result suggests alternative forecasting method for modelling electricity price on Italy and comparisons between univariate and panel framework. The second research examines the impact of renewable energy on the congestion occurrence and cost. We analyse quantitative properties of the econometric estimation in order to gain insight into the economic mechanism and to draw policy suggestion. Finally, the final research attempts to address the interdependence of prices in six macro-zones of the Italian electricity market."
"This work analyses activist groups as organizations of social movements. Firstly, I study how activists express their message by mobilizing symbols (discourses, demeanor, objects…) in order to build a set of performances called the “tactical repertoire”. To do so, they draw inspiration from their predecessors and their theoretical frames. Secondly, I describe how activists mobilize media. Their media strategy relies both on the tactical repertoire and the integration of activists into the group. Finally, I enquire how the activist group mobilize its members (how it recruits and retains them); the acquisition of emancipatory skills is a particularly strong motivation for activists. In the conclusion, I show that the tactical repertoire is the backbone of an activist group as it participates in all the tasks described (mobilization of symbols, of media and of activists). This specific characteristic defines the activist group as an organization. I rely on a one-year-long ethnography among the French feminist activist group La Barbe, which denounces the absence of women at the head of organizations. I also reflect on the methodological implications of observing a feminist activist group as a male ethnographer."
"This thesis contributes to the ongoing debate about whether water scarcity will lead to growing water conflicts and potential threats to food security. Using quantitative and econometric tools, it addresses the empirical allocation of water resources in the context of shared water and international trade of agriculture.Chapter 1, co-authored with Prof. Eric Strobl, studies transboundary water management between upstream and downstream African countries (1949-2007). We find very little evidence for water conflicts over the years, even though cooperation is likelier when there is little economic and water asymmetries between countries. We also show that wealthy downstream nations mostly take the lead in cooperation, allowing geographical asymmetries to be oﬀset by economics. Results indicate that cooperation is independent from the past, meaning that transboundary basins with a history of tensions over water may likely cooperate in the near future.Chapter 2, co-authored with Prof. Shlomi Dinar, investigates whether countries produce and trade food according to their comparative advantage in water. Using panel data of bilateral trade at a global level (1994-2007), we find that the driest countries use trade as a means to alleviate water scarcity. Relative water productivity and food trade display an inverted u-shape, suggesting a threshold eﬀect in demand and a disregard for water resources relative to the lack of other inputs (such as capital, technology or qualified labor) in water-scarce countries. Countries do not take water endowments enough into consideration when deciding about production and food is traded in the wrong direction, from less to relatively more water productive nations.Because agricultural-dependence is water-dependence, we end by asking whether water scarcity can be a threat to development. Chapter 3 shows that exports concentrate with growth but diversify with water availability. The interaction eﬀect is positive, suggesting that countries, as they develop, concentrate on fewer products for which they have comparative advantage in water. As water intensive goods display lower subsistence in time in water-scarce countries, we argue that ineﬃcient management of water prevents countries from developing and exiting the state of water/agriculture dependency and slow growth. We recommend that water-scarce countries focus on improving the water footprint of a small number of goods in order to trigger positive spillovers."
"This Ph.D. thesis is composed of three chapters. Since Kreps and Scheinkman's seminal article (1983) a large number of papers have analyzed capacity constraints' potential to relax price competition. However, the majority of the ensuing literature has assumed that products are either perfect or very close substitutes. Therefore very little is known about the interaction between capacity constraints and local monopoly power. The aim of the present paper is to shed light on this question using a standard Hotelling setup. The high level of product dierentiation results in a variety of equilibrium firm behavior and it generates at least one pure-strategy equilibrium for any capacity level. The second chapter, ""Bertrand-Edgeworth Competition with Substantial Product Differentiation"", studies the price-setting behavior of a monopoly facing two capacity constraints: one on the number of consumers it can serve, the other on the total amount of products it can sell. Facing two consumer groups that difer in their demands and the distribution of their willingness-to-pay, the monopoly's optimal non-linear pricing strategy consists of offering one or two price-quantity bundles. The characterization of the firm's optimal pricing as a function of its two capacities reveals a rich structure that also gives rise to some surprising results. In particular, I show that prices are non-monotonic in capacity levels. Moreover, there always exists a range of parameters in which weakening one of the capacity constraints decreases consumer surplus. In the long run, when the firms can choose how much capacity to build, prices and consumer surplus are monotonic in capacity costs. The third chapter, ""Competition with Dual Capacity Constraints"", studies duopoly pricing under dual capacity constraints, limiting both the total quantity and the number of consumers served. It extends both the analysis of monopoly pricing with dual capacity constraints and the symmetric models of Bertrand-Edgeworth competition with a singular capacity. By isolating parameter regions where a symmetric pure-strategy equilibrium exists, I nd that several types of equilibria are possible, depending on the model's specications. For some of them, duopoly prices are identical to monopoly prices. Equilibrium prices are non-monotonic in capacity levels if consumers' valuations are suciently heterogeneous. Moreover, I show that despite their ability to price discriminate, competition may lead firms to charge identical prices across markets."
"This work centers on the tenet that organizational rationality is bounded: decision makers search, satisfice, and think in the way that is typical (in its integrity) only of humans. The dissertation explores this interplay between search and decision maker’s cognition and demonstrates how biases in characteristic aspects of our thinking can be instruments of behavioral strategy.As a starting point, I take search, sequential generation and evaluation of alternatives, as the first primitive of bounded rationality and complement it with integral elements of human cognition, such as automatic, intuitive thinking, specifically affect heuristic, and imperfect mental representations of reality. With the help of computational models, I track the effects of the corresponding biases (systematic affective preferences and systematic errors in mental representations) over time as organizations adapt to complex environments. This allows me to identify life cycles of the elements of human cognition and show that organizations should manage (rather than eliminate) some biases over time. Finally, I derive predictions and empirically test a subset of my propositions.In conclusion, this work aims to advance the emerging theory of behavioral strategy by jointly considering different primitives of bounded rationality and integrating them with the existing knowledge in organization sciences. A broad question that motivates this work is how organizations can manage the many bounds to human rationality."
"This dissertation addresses unexplored issues on the antecedents, management, and outcomes of corporate venture capital (CVC). More specifically, I examine how negative performance feedback and corporate governance influence the direction of organizational change ˗ in terms of exploration and exploitation ˗ and how balancing such change over time influences firm performance in the CVC context. I first review the extant literature on CVC and lay out the unique contributions of my research. Then, in the first essay, I theorize on how poor firm performance influences the resource allocation decisions on exploration and exploitation and how such decisions are affected by the concentration of dedicated and transient shareholders and by the board of directors' monitoring and advising intensities. In the second essay, I empirically examine how the resource allocation decisions on exploration and exploitation are influenced by dedicated and transient shareholders in the context of CVC investing. In the third essay, I examine how balancing exploration and exploitation over time and the characteristics of oscillation impact firm performance. The empirical analysis in the latter two essays is based on CVC investments made by 286 U.S. companies during 1993-2013. This dissertation contributes to the Behavioral Theory of the Firm and Corporate Governance research by introducing how shareholders and boards influence managerial decision-making in search and change, Ambidexterity research by studying how continuous change and organizational inertia impact temporal spillover between exploration and exploitation, and CVC research by examining the antecedents and consequences of explorative and exploitative initiatives in CVC investing."
"In the first chapter, I ask if short-sellers are superiorly informed about sovereign auctions. I find a large average increase in demand for short-selling prior to auctions. Yet, the demand for short-selling a bond does not predict a subsequent increase in the bond's yield. Overall, there is no evidence that short-sellers predict or interpret auction outcomes better than the market.In the second chapter, I develop and test a model explaining the gradual price decrease observed in the days leading to large anticipated asset sales such as Treasury auctions. In the model, risk-averse investors anticipate an asset sale which magnitude, and hence price, are uncertain. I show that investors face a trade-off between hedging the price risk with a long position, and speculating on the difference between the pre-sale and the expected sale prices. Due to hedging, the equilibrium price is above the expected sale price. As the sale date approaches, uncertainty about the sale price decreases, short speculative positions increase and the price decreases. In line with the predictions, I find that the yield of Italian Treasuries increases by 1.2 bps after the release of auction price information, compared to non-information days.In the third chapter, I study the link between prices and repo rates during the subprime crisis. I find that the no-arbitrage relationship between prices and repo rates in Duffie (1996) fares worse during the crisis. However, low-repo-rate bonds have an 18.0% higher probability of being more expensive than identical high-repo-rate bonds during the crisis, compared to only 9.0% before the crisis. Overall, while there are high limits of arbitrage, prices and repo rates feature larger co-movements during the crisis."
"This work of doctoral research aims to examine the interactions between multinationals, Algerian companies and their common firms and identify the impact on the structure and culture developed within it. It also aims to examine the characteristics of the structure and culture of international dyadic alliances and understand their specificities in the Algerian context.Finally, another objective it is reviewing the decision model in the alliance and the identification of the roles of the joint venture, the local parent and the multinational.To do this we assume acknowledged, in literature, stipulating that multinational position of strength, seek to impose their structure model to the common firm and develop their own culture within it. They also seek to dominate the relationship and centralize all decisions.From a study of two alliances, one found in the hotel sector with a French multinational and the other found in the pharmaceutical sector with a US multinational, we demonstrate that these theoretical findings, are only partially confirmed within the studied alliances.This research is inserted into field work with a study of both qualitative and quantitative, on the Algerian territory, where no similar studies have been conducted, to our knowledge.We demonstrate that the multinational imposes its organizational model, but fails to fully develop its common culture within the alliance.We also demonstrate that multinationals dominate certain managerial decisions and share more with the local partner. And when the multinational is trying to dominate the whole, competitive retaliation may be considered by the ally and touch his interests.We also cleared, the characteristics of the structure and culture of international alliances studied in Algerian context.On the other hand, the study of international dyadic alliances Algerian context; seems to reveal the existence of differences in behavior of the alliance, depending on the status of ""public"" or ""private"" of the local parent."
"The business model (or BM) has been popularised by managers since the end of the 1990’s. This notion is much debated within the academic sphere: even if a consensus has been reached with regards to its definition, a debate around its significance, components and its relationhip with strategy remains. We have focused on analysing the articulation between the notions of business models and strategy in the context of major technological change. Through this particular context, we were able to observe many modifications of strategy and business models. Starting from the literature, we suggest a conceptual framework that we have deployed to study eight case-studies of French actors who are positioned in the emergent market of ebook.This empirical study has enabled us to confirm the systemic nature of the BM: on average, a strategic components impacts three components of BM directly and another six indirectly. We also conclude that there is a co-construction process of the business model and the strategy: the strategy impacts the BM almost systematically, and the BM affects strategic components in almost 60% of the cases. The resources and the value network are the components of the BM that affect the strategy most. Thus, our results can contribute towards reflections such as effectuation. We have also observed (that both the company's history and environment have an impact on the BM more than on the strategy (in volumetry). This has led us to broaden the notion of path dependence, but also to nuance the statement that the BM would be different from the strategy due to a slighter sensitivity to the environment. Our results also suggest that the adjustment to technological change differs depending on the characteristics of the actors. We were also interested in a more managerial issue: the distribution of value in the sector. We concluded that the chain upstream value is greater than its downstream counterpart, and that managers will have the greatest difficulties in making the central activity of e-diffusion profitable."
The development of medical tourism involves several developing countries today. Morocco has made the strategic act of the medical tourism. Many care institutions are involved in this development and we seek to identify how the skills of actors involved and the terms of their acquisition. This dimension is complementary to the organizational changes that have been set to offer services to a customer base increasingly diverse.
"In the context of the transition of societies towards sustainable development, the role of universities is increasingly highlighted. In this respect, assessment, as a support tool for organizations whishing to improve their performance, can be of great assistance. Opportunities for the application of assessment remains however limited. The university and sustainability are normative objects and their definition is subject to considerable opposition. In addition, their reality is progressive and characterized by high levels of uncertainty and paradoxical complexity.This work aims to determine the conditions under which assessment practices can support, or otherwise hinder, the performances of universities toward sustainability. It comes in two parts.The first part focuses on the theoretical construction of an evaluation norm for the ""sustainable performances of universities"". It is based on a comprehensive review of the specific features of the university and sustainability, as well as on an analysis of several best practices identified internationally. The second part compares and strengthens those findings by focussing on the design of an operational assessment methodology. This research was conducted through a multi- stakeholder participatory process that led to the building of a multidimensional framework comprising more than 50 indicators. This tool aims to be a contribution to the development of assessment methods for academic actors willing to identify ways of improving their performances with respect to sustainability."
"In France, the university buildings have significant challenges to meet the environmental transition requirements for green growth. At the same time, they are key elements for the spread of the sustainable development objectives at the building, the university campus, and the city scale. Universities are institutions capable of promoting changes in society, but also are institutions that need to be changed. In other words, before being a model for society, universities should implement sustainable behavior through the promotion of sustainable practices on campus. It is possible to say that energy consumption, CO2 emissions and lack of integration with the city are the major problems faced by French universities.Nowadays, the sustainable strategies implementation to improve buildings performance faces many challenges, including the lack of experience and information to support decision-making. A participatory tool for support decision-making was developed and tested to measure the performance of the ‘Aile Sud’ building renovation strategies in the Bergerie Nationale. The performance of the ‘Aile Sud’ building renovation strategies was assessed, and some recommendations for performance improvement were suggested in a continuous improvement approach."
"This thesis is an empirical study of price dispersion, namely the fact that a homogenous good can typically be purchased at various prices, in violation of the famous law of one price. The approach belongs to a literature initiated by Stigler (1961), which notes that “price dispersion is (...) the measure of ignorance in the market”. A noteworthy consequence is that simple price observations can be very informative about competition in a market.The first chapter analyses the impact of the creation of a discount chain on the French retail gasoline market. This creation implies that many gas stations are confronted with a sharp price decrease by a competitor. The aggregate reaction, measured at the national level, is weak but it conceals increases and decreases in equivalent proportions The heterogeneity of measured reactions highlights an important market segmentation. Using the same data, the second chapter explores the relevance of models which identify price dispersion with an equilibrium in mixed strategies. Empirically, the rank of competing gas stations is indeed observed to vary over time, and its volatility is positively correlated with the distance that separates the outlets. Dispersion thus increases with a search cost incurred by customers. The chain affiliation of gas stations largely determines their pricing strategies. Retailers which have low price policies are more likely than others to keep prices aligned with nearby competitors, while dispersion measured between more expensive gas stations is positively correlated with diesel cost and the number of sellers in the market. Results thus provide further support the coexistence of a market close to Bertrand competition with a less competitive market, where gas stations take advantage of significant frictions.The last chapter focuses on grocery stores, using data collected from an online price comparison website. Aggregate national chain comparisons that are displayed on the website are found to provide information of little value to consumers given the heterogeneity observed within store level comparison results. These can furthermore vary significantly depending on the set of compared products. Volatility tends to increase with the distance that separates supermarkets, which, as in the case of gasoline, suggests that search cost influence competition. Within local markets, the measured concentration is negatively correlated with price levels, which leads to question its effective relevance in terms of public policies. Price dispersion is found to increase with market price levels, which is consistent with sellers taking advantage of consumer search costs to post higher prices."
"This thesis focuses on the way multinational corporations (MNCs) develop and manage the required competences to sustain their innovation strategy when their market dynamism is shifting towards Asia.The literature presents various models to organize innovation processes globally but does not answer the question of their dynamic constitution based on a given situation.Drawing upon an interactive research conducted within Valeo – a worldwide automotive supplier – this thesis focuses on that dynamic dimension. It sheds light on how (i) China constitutes a disruptive experience for the Western MNC because of the speed and scale of the phenomenon, as well as the context, (ii) the strategy implemented by the MNC in China from Europe has helped to deal with the difficult situation in the short term, but is not the best way to develop the necessary competences locally to enable the local teams to become autonomous.We thus suggest: (i) at the micro level, a new way of designing training programs that involves shifting from a teaching-centered approach to a learning-centered approach,  (ii) at the macro level, a trajectory to improve the constitution of R-I-D (Research, Innovation, Development) competences in the global firm, on the one hand in China via the coaching of local trainers and the development of communities of practice, and on the other hand globally via the constitution of an organizational vehicle such as a Corporate University, to address simultaneously learning and talent management issues – both individually & collectively, locally & globally, in-house & in link with the outside world."
"This doctoral thesis aims to provide a theorization of Local Economic Development (LED) in the Least Developed Countries (LDC). It also presents a synthesis of the conditions and assumptions of programs and institutions to reach transformative and sustainable change in local territories. Such a change is intended to drive the LDCs towards a sound development trajectory. The topic of the thesis is placed within the framework of the strategic options of local development and the choice of societies in the Least Developed Countries.The research, based on a case study of local development financing, is carried out with four qualitative data sources collected from 2014 to 2017 in the field of a less advanced economy. The epistemological posture starts by the nature of the problems identified and the specificities of the Least Developed Countries. The pragmatic constructivist approach made it possible to answer and explain observable phenomena related to the problem of identifying processes leading to local economic development following appropriate funding mechanism.The results of this doctoral research have highlighted an empirical framework for local development in LDCs.The contributions of this doctoral thesis numerous. First, they are of a theoretical nature, through an understanding of the local governance system in the least developed countries. The theoretical framework specific to the LDCs is thus analysed and allows to develop a set of preconditions for local development in the LDCs. Secondly, the contributions of this work deal with development policies and public policies.Indeed, we propose financing strategies adapted to the specificities of LDCs based on the two pillars of local development in the least developed economies: local governance and entrepreneurs, on the so-called ""mixed"" financing mechanisms. The theoretical model and LED preconditions provide an overview of strategies to implement the virtuous circle of LED in these economies."
"My dissertation concatenates two independent parts. The first one dealswith crypto-economics whereas the second one is about theoretical econometrics. In the first chapter, I present a model which predicts bitcoin miners’ total computing power using the bitcoin / dollar exchange rate. The second chapter builds on a simplified version of the preceeding model to show to which extent the current Bitcoin protocol is inefficient and suggest a simple solution to lower the cryptocurrency’s electricity consumption. The third chapter explains how to identify and estimate the sharp bounds of the average marginal effect’s identification region in a fixed effects logit model with panel data."
"This research is in the interface of sustainable operations management, technology management, and finance. Specifically, in my research I strive to examine firm's incentives to adopt `technology improvement' (TI) measures that lead to the more efficient use of inputs in operations and thereby affect the cost structure, risk exposure, and environmental performance of firms. Thus I seek to identify the factors that affect---and the mechanisms by which they do so---a firm's decision to invest in TI: forces within a supply chain, price uncertainty in the markets for inputs, cash constraints, financial hedging mechanisms, industry competition, and the firm's competitive pricing strategy. By collaborating with professors in the fields of operations research, economics, and finance, I have embraced a multidisciplinary approach to studying the adoption of efficient and sustainable technologies.In particular, in my first chapter, ``Technology Improvement Contracting in Supply Chains under Asymmetric Bargaining Power'' I examine how asymmetric bargaining power---between buyers and suppliers---affects the optimal level of investment in technology improvement. In my second chapter, ``Input-price Risk Management: Technology Improvement and Financial Hedging'', I explore  the mechanism driving a firm's interest in TI under increased uncertainty about input prices. Finally, in the third chapter, ``The Value of Financial Risk Management in Dynamic Capacity Investment and Technology Improvement'', I study the role of budget constraint and financial hedging on the choice of technology."
"Land use change for the purpose of development always comes with conflicts among different stakeholders, especially under the construction or expansion of developmental projects in developing countries. Thus, infrastructural projects like dams have both positive and negative consequences in this regard. The conflicts in such projects emerge with view of issues associated with the superposition of land expectation, as well as different stakeholders' interests. They appear in different forms, depending upon their intensity, with severe impacts on local people. The article deals with conflicts arising among different actors and their socioeconomic impacts on affected people, due to construction of Diamer Bhasha Dam project in Pakistan. This project started facing opposition from land acquisition and encouraged protestations, legal action in court, road blockage, threatening the project contractor, and violation.In order to analyze the conflicts and to assess the socioeconomic impacts of the project, we used both primary and secondary data sources. About 61 interviews with experts and stakeholders of different backgrounds were conducted.Moreover, under the secondary source about 289 articles from different national and regional dailies on conflicts and socioeconomics impacts of the Dam were studied in order to cross check the information. Further, some literature published by public and private organizations was also consulted.Preliminary results show different conflicts between affected people and Government and also among different groups of locally affected people, over land compensations and property rights. This study further highlights the socioeconomic issues of the project in the form of ineffective resettlement plan and loss of employment opportunities. It further, explores the root causes of conflicts, due to poor planning and governance, mismanagement, corruption and cronyism in different project activities. Lack of participation of all stakeholders and proper information dissemination about all project activities are also main source of conflicts among different actors. Finally, it provides policy measures and recommendations for better governance in the form of capacity building of local people in different areas and participation of all stakeholders in all project activities."
"Due to the limited availability of landfill sites, local authorities have strongly encouraged since 2008 the structuration of waste treatment channels. As concerns the organic wastes, a special attention has been paid for recycling them through composting. In this study, we focused on the conditions of development of a sector for recycling organic wastes in Guadeloupe through the assessment of the conditions affecting compost adoption by farmers. In order to identify and evaluate the determinants of farmers 'choices, we applied an original approach combining an ex-post analysis of current practices and farmers' perceptions, and an ex-ante analysis using the Choice Experiment method of levers for facilitating the adoption of compost. We test biotechnical levers concerning compost properties and the facilitation of practices with technical support, and economic levers mainly focused on the implementation of new AgroEnvironmental Schemes (AES) to promote economically the composts. We observed that the adoption rate is relatively low (18% of farmers) and highly dependent on the agricultural sector (i.e. banana, sugarcane, vegetables and food crops), the socio-economic characteristics of the farmers and the lack of organization of the waste recycling chain (e.g., information, transport, spreading, subsidies). We demonstrated that farmers are very sensitive to the improvement of compost quality by increasing its fertilizer value, as well as to the logistical, economic and administrative support for its transport and spreading. They are also willing to participate in a collective incentive in the form of a conditional monetary bonus paid individually to farmers. The results of this study indicated that farmers are not reluctant to a regular use of compost provided that organizational barriers identified are removed, and that the agronomic value of the composts meets the expectations of farmers. Regional plans can now be defined and implemented to develop the massive use of compost from the recycling of organic waste in Guadeloupe."
"The guiding principle of this thesis is to show how the arsenal of recent optimization methods can help solving challenging new estimation problems on events models.While the classical framework of supervised learning treat the observations as a collection of independent couples of features and labels, events models focus on arrival timestamps to extract information from the source of data.These timestamped events are chronologically ordered and can't be regarded as independent.This mere statement motivates the use of a particular mathematical object called point process to learn some patterns from events.Two examples of point process are treated in this thesis.The first is the point process behind Cox proportional hazards model:its conditional intensity function allows to define the hazard ratio, a fundamental quantity in survival analysis literature.The Cox regression model relates the duration before an event called failure to some covariates.This model can be reformulated in the framework of point processes.The second is the Hawkes process which models how past events increase the probability of future events.Its multivariate version enables encoding a notion of causality between the different nodes.The thesis is divided into three parts.The first focuses on a new optimization algorithm we developed to estimate the parameter vector of the Cox regression in the large-scale setting.Our algorithm is based on stochastic variance reduced gradient descent (SVRG) and uses Monte Carlo Markov Chain to estimate one costly term in the descent direction.We proved the convergence rates and showed its numerical performance on both simulated and real-world datasets.The second part shows how the Hawkes causality can be retrieved in a nonparametric fashion from the integrated cumulants of the multivariate point process.We designed two methods to estimate the integrals of the Hawkes kernels without any assumption on the shape of the kernel functions. Our methods are faster and more robust towards the shape of the kernels compared to state-of-the-art methods. We proved the statistical consistency of the first method, and designed turned the second into a convex optimization problem.The last part provides new insights from order book data using the first nonparametric method developed in the second part.We used data from the EUREX exchange, designed new order book model (based on the previous works of Bacry et al.) and ran the estimation method on these point processes.The results are very insightful and consistent with an econometric analysis.Such work is a proof of concept that our estimation method can be used on complex data like high-frequency financial data."
"Abstract :In a context of modernization of the state, public structures have to face many organizational changes as well as a rise in psychosocial risks. From the works conducted on hypermodernity that we supplement with the theory of the preservation of resources, we seek to identify some issues in public management. This research, based on a qualitative study conducted among three decentralized state administrations, examines the dynamics between three variables: psychosocial risk factors, available resources and professional values. The analysis reveals, on the one hand, the existence of risksconsistent with those identified in private companies, on the other hand, the presence of regulatory resources related to the quality of relations with peers and the nature of missions as much as development opportunities; and, finally, values relating to motivation for public service. In general terms, the interpretation of the data indicates that professional values frequently come up against the logic of the new public management that underpins the new modes of public production. However, far from being passive, agents are turning to other ""safe haven"" values, such as the usefulness of their work or the satisfaction of users, who act as new resources in a context of uncertain future."
"Agroecosystems show a decline in  regulating, non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). We interpret this decline through two economic concepts: public goods, which call for regulation, and joint production, which underlines the role of interactions among ecosystem services in their regulation.This thesis studies how to increase the provision of non-marketed ES through the implementation of economic incentives, while accounting for their multiplicity and the complex interactions among them.We first study the regulation of joint public goods with microeconomic theory. We then carry an applied analysis with simulated agroecological data and numerical methods to define cost-efficient solutions and simulate the implementation these solutions with economic incentives. We especially compare result-based and action-based incentives.We show theoretically that interactions among ES make their regulation more complex, especially with result-based incentives and when the production cost varies among bundles of ES. In the applied analysis, we show that accounting for the cost is crucial to maximise ES with a limited budget. We show that result-based incentives select cost-efficient bundles of ES but lead to higher policy budgets than action-based ones, due to interactions among ES. Eventually, we show that considering the landscape scale and heterogeneity plays on the solutions maximising ES, but not on the comparison between result-based and action-based incentives.Our results underline that agri-environmental policies need to target ES in a integrative way, at the farm or landscape scale, and consider the cost of providing non-marketed ES. Result-based incentives don’t solve all issues of agri-environmental policies."
"This dissertation studies the redistributive effects of minimum wage policies. The first chapter provides the first causal evidence of how the minimum wage has affected the historical evolution of racial inequality in the United States. It shows that the extension of the federal minimum wage to new sectors of the economy in 1967 can explain more than 20% of the decline in the racial earnings gap observed during the Civil Rights Era -- the only period of time (post World-War II) during which racial inequality fell in the United States. This effect is as large as previously studied policies and economic factors, such as the improvement in schooling for African-Americans or federal anti-discrimination policies. The second chapter estimates the pass-through of minimum wage increases into prices of US grocery stores, using high-frequency scanner level data. A 10% minimum wage hike translates into a 0.2% increase in grocery prices between 2001 and 2012. This magnitude is consistent with a full pass-through of cost increases into consumer prices. Depending on household income, grocery price increases offset between 3 and 12% of the nominal income gains. The third chapter estimates a calibrated labor market model to analyze the likely effects of a $15 federal minimum wage by 2024. It compares employment numbers if the policy were adopted to employment numbers if the policy had not been adopted using a wide range of well-identified elasticities."
"This thesis analyses the relationships between appropriation of management tools, and emergence and effectiveness of collective strategies, which are two sides of one object in management sciences: Collective action. The chosen field of study is the transaction between dairy farmers and factories, in France. This transaction is particular because it requires the use of several management tools and because the management system that regulate this transaction has been reconsidered. Three approaches are used in this thesis: a historical approach of the management system, a case study approach to enlighten the current evolution of this apparatus, and a longitudinal observation approach of connections between a group of dairy producers and their customer. This thesis shows that management tools and strategies are embedded. The national management system is a strategic construct of value-chain’s representatives. It constitutes the basic rules that constrained local apparatus. The thesis reveals back and forth between the national adaptations of the apparatus and the local appropriations of the tools, and the strategic designs that lead this interrelationship. It also reveals that power relationships, in the end, persist. (Last and final summary in the thesis)"
"This PhD thesis gives a numerical illustration of how a carbon tax affects South African GDP, employment, CO2 emissions and socio-economic inequality. It uses a “hybrid” computable general equilibrium model of an open economy in a one-step projection from 2005 to 2035. It models second-best economies, notably skill-related rigidities in the labour market and in production of electricity. Seven scenarios for recycling of carbon tax revenue are analysed, plus an option to invest a part of tax revenue in improvement of skills of labour.The analysis shows that under conventional assumptions about technological change, a carbon tax of around 100 ZAR2005 (18 USD2013) per tonne of CO2 will have little negative consequences for GDP and employment, when combined with the right type of tax revenue recycling: Labour subsidies and company profit tax reduction likely lead to the best macro-economic outcomes, though do not reduce inequality. Additional measures are needed to reduce “energy poverty”. To achieve South Africa’s NDC of the Paris Agreement, a carbon tax rate of around 300 ZAR2005 or 55 USD2013 per tonne of CO2 is necessary. However, this could have serious impacts on GDP growth. Also, without a change in the trend of increasing labour productivity, such lower GDP will lead to higher unemployment than in the reference case. An investment in skills of 7.5 billion ZAR2005 of annual Ctax revenue, with the objective of increasing access to high quality education and reducing the high skill labour shortage, if fond to have a very positive impact on GDP growth. However better calibration data is required.The findings of this PhD thesis furthermore call for thorough examination of what type of technological change could be expected for South Africa. Technological progress, consumer preferences and international circumstances limit the economy’s capacity to restructure and decarbonise and therefore to reduce negative consequences of carbon taxation for GDP growth. Proper assessment of future technological change is relevant for all sectors and inputs. Examples are given which show that energy and materials efficiency have an important role for future GDP growth under carbon constraints, because they determine the economy’s flexibility to reduce energy consumption and to substitute it, e.g. by labour. This finding normally holds not only for South Africa, but also for the rest of the world. These results also imply that international climate policy has to address technology transfer and the different potentials of national economies to decarbonise seriously."
"The European Union has an ambitious agenda to deal with the effects of climate change, the European institutions must now take environment into account within the framework of its policies. The objective of my thesis is to evaluate the impacts of European public policies on agriculture and environment, to measure their crossed effects and to assess the potential for a better coordination of these policies. The thesis aims to enrich the economic analysis on important issues refocused on the reduction of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and the level of agricultural production, from a quantitative perspective. The methodology is based on a mathematical programming model that simulates the European agricultural supply (AROPAj), using data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network. The analysis is carried out at several levels, European, national, regional and sub-regional, taking into account the variability of the economic context that characterizes the European agriculture over the six years 2007-2012. We first assess how agriculture may contribute to the mitigation of EU GHG emissions and provide a detailed analysis of marginal abatement cost curves. The results show that, on average, over the period 2007-2012, EU agriculture may reduce its emissions by around 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively for emission prices of 38, 112.5 and 205 EUR/tCO2eq. We show that agriculture may offer substantial mitigation and that mitigation costs and potential vary in time and in space. The second issue studied concerns the compatibility between the increase in agricultural production and the reduction of the impact of agriculture on the environment. By introducing a primal approach (via a carbon price) and a dual approach (via a calorie target), we show that we can reduce GHG emissions and change agricultural supply while increasing the quantity of food calories. We extend the issue of GHG emissions by separating the prices of the two gases (CH4 et N2O). A differentiated price system allows to better adapt the climate regulation policy according to the time horizon on which we are projected, offering flexibility in reducing the emission abatement costs."
"As a developing country with surging demand in electricity, Vietnam has implemented demand-side management in the residential electricity market, such as increasing block tariffs to balance the tension between energy security and the development of clean technology. The implementation of demand-side management requires a deep understanding of customer behaviors and household demand. The thesis aims to explore the factors impacting on Vietnamese residential electricity demand in the period of 2012–16. The exploration focuses on four main factors: prices, income, demographics (including household size and composition), and heatwaves. The data are a pool data set and a panel data set which have been constructed from the three rounds of the micro survey Vietnam Household Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) in 2012, 2014 and 2016.The thesis has two novel points in estimating household electricity demand function.First, it uses micro survey data at national level, with detailed tariff structures and private electricity billing. In the past, researches have often used national aggregate data or national micro survey data with imputed quantity or price. Researches that use micro survey data with detail tariff schedules and electricity bills are often at a regional level rather than at a national level due to the absence of national data on tariff structures. The residential electricity market in Vietnam is a monopoly with a single seller, Vietnam Electricity (EVN). Electricity tariff schedules are proposed by EVN and set by the Government and are thus uniform in national scale. This provides a chance to estimate demand function from national micro survey data, with full detail of electricity prices and billings.Second, the thesis proposes a new way to capture the impact of high temperature on electricity demand. That is, to include an additional dummy variable to represent the extreme distribution of temperature. The additional dummy variable is a complement to the concept of cooling degree days which is a popular representation of temperature in previous researches.The estimate results lead to five main conclusions. (i) Households do respond to marginal prices and demand is elastic to price. (ii) There exists an income threshold from which household electricity consumption increases as income increases. The electricity consumption of households in the income group is the reference level of electricity poverty threshold. (iii) The increasing block tariff does not cancel out economies of scale in electricity expenditure of households. (iv) There is no difference in electricity expenditure across children, adults and elders. (v) Heatwaves – a climate change related phenomenon – do have impacts on electricity demand and need to be addressed carefully in estimating electricity demand in the future."
"The storm risk has a strong impact on forest management, directly through the damages a storm can cause and indirectly through induced precautionary behaviors.This PhD thesis addresses the issue of even-aged forest management with multiple age-classes in presence of a storm risk and when the producer has recursive preferences. Unlike expected utility preferences, recursive preferences distinguish between risk aversion and intertemporal preferences.An original analytical approach based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, as well as a numerical stochastic dynamic programming approach are used to characterize stationary states and to clarify the role of determinants, in particular the role of preferences. In addition, the analysis is extended to the issues of land allocation and climate change.Results show that the storm risk combined with preferences leads forest producers to reduce the average rotation age out of precaution, as it permits to reduce the forest exposure and vulnerability. Moreover, land use diversification in favor of activities without risk and providing a regular income is shown to be another option to adapt to the storm risk. Finally, producers' expectations of an increase in the storm risk probability, which comes along climate change, are revealed as another source of precautionary behavior.In all the situations considered, risk aversion and intertemporal preferences are shown to have distinct roles, confirming that recursive preferences are relevant to deal with this type of issues."
"In subsaharan Africa (SSA) the local elite is the key player of local economic emergence. The elite of LED must lead to the valorisation of territorial ressources, to the setting-up of the rules of the game, to the creation of local firms and local players. The existence of local elite is therefore a success factor of LED.In this thesis, we have investigated the functions, the capacities and the behaviours, opinions and practices of the various members of the local elite of LED. We have conducted a qualitative research with the case study in Foumban, Cameroon. Our methodology was organised in three main steps: development of a concept and of identification criterias of the elite of LED; identification of this elite in Foumban; face-to-face interviews with the elite.As we explain in this thesis, LED in SSA is a process that requires a variety of local elite who build the capacities of territories through its actions and interactions. The elite of LED is made by individuals, pursuing their own interests, and using their powers. They are doing an institutional work and they are changing the rules of the game intentionally or not. They are not the official players, but only those functional players able to unlock the territorial potential through two main actions: the activation, that aims at mobilizing stakeholders and the expertise, that aims at imagining solutions to generate the territorial ressources.In Foumban, we have observed that the elite of LED we identified is conducting concrete actions and in doing so relies on capacities to implemt its LED functions. We also have noticed strong differences among the opinions of the elite of LED, for example about the issue of the impact of communities on development, about the territory as a container or a recipient of resources, or about bottom-up vs. top-down LED approach.Unlike the Western approach of LED promoting the cooperation between the main stakeholders, we have highlighted that in a context of development and transition, the transformation of local level into a productive territory needs the intervention of a “biodiversity” of local elite in competition. Its multiple confrontations and difficult negotiations enable the creation, the change and the selection of performing institutions. The local elite of LED is debating about the future : all ideas can be expressed and are negotiable until a stable situation has been reached.In Foumban, we also have identified a consensus within the elite on a key issue: the importance of the Very Small Firms for local development. This consensus shows that behind differences and competitions, the local elite shares some values and that a certain collective awareness does exist about the winning strategy."
"In the first chapter, after a presentation of institutional settings, I will focus on the use of sector-level agreements by large firms to reduce competition. Indeed, wage floors are binding for all firms of the industry, whether they sit at the negotiating table or not. This chapter provides a theoretical framework showing that such agreements can be used by dominant firms to reduce competition. In this framework, the higher the over-representation of large firms in employers' federations, the larger the bargained wage floors. This leads to the eviction of small firms. This prediction is tested on French administrative data. I document the domination of large firms within federations and devise an instrumental strategy to  show that when the bargaining firms are relatively large compared to the industry standard - ie the lower the federation's representativeness, the higher are wage floors.In the second chapter, I look at the effect of sector-level agreements on innovation. It is based on a model with monopolistic competition between products of an industry on the one hand, and between industries on the other hand. First, I find that when the bargaining process occurs at the industry level, negotiating parties take into account that a wage increase will deter investments of competitors. Indeed, when the wage negotiated at the industry-level increases, the labor cost increase implies that the reward for innovations decrease. As this will reduce the probability to be outperformed, this will generate a wage surplus when the bargaining takes place at the industry-level, reducing both production and employment. Furthermore, it will decrease the research effort of the industry reducing the productivity growth.In the final chapter, I find that international competition mitigates the previous effects. Indeed, collective wage bargaining allows firms of a given industry to coordinate. However, international competition makes this collusive equilibrium unsustainable. Indeed, domestic firms face competition from foreign competitors which are not bound by those agreements. To support this argument, a Melitz-type model is developed and its implications tested on French data using the China Shock as a source of exogenous variation. The rent extracted during sector-level agreements no longer exist when domestic firms face Chinese competition."
"Financial implications for buyers in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have been a topic of fascination with academics and practitioners for decades. Despite extensive business research dedicated toward investigating whether and how acquirers perform financially in the short and long terms following M&A, so far, the clarity of our understanding about these issues remains elusive. This doctoral thesis seeks to bring more clarity to these questions by examining complex interactions among several key aspects of M&A. Chapter 1 investigates how acquirer experience influences long-term performance through key pre- and post-transaction decisions and how such indirect influence differs in domestic and cross-border contexts. Chapter 2 explores the configurations of deal and acquirer characteristics as well as acquirer corporate governance mechanisms corresponding to positive acquirer cumulative abnormal returns (CAR). Chapter 3 investigates the interactive effects among host countries’ formal institutions, acquirer characteristics and corporate governance mechanisms on acquirer CAR. Finally, Chapter 4 examines the influence of business news reports on acquirer CAR."
"The present dissertation examines the entanglement of the social and material in Multinational Enterprises during the transnational transfer of Human Resource Management Practices, especially Performance Management Practices. Using 4 local Chinese entities of a transnational firm as my case study, I explore how local employees make Performance Management practices their own, both internalizing global practices and innovating to adapt to local environments. This research is based on 60 interviews, secondary materials and direct observations over more than 10 years. In the first chapter of this dissertation, I explore more specifically the adoption of Human Resource Management practices at the micro level, and I identify four archetypes of the adoption of Human Resource Management practices: formal, ceremonial, deviant and innovative. In the second chapter, I focus on the adoption of Performance Management practices in Multinational Enterprises at a meso level. Drawing on sociomaterial theory, I propose a new definition of	hybridization as being a process by which unique practices emerge in local subsidiaries from the entanglement of the social and the material at Headquarters and in local subsidiaries. This definition allowed me to identify two new hybrid performance management practices in the four Chinese entities of the Multinational Enterprises under investigation, which I have called the “harmonious Confucian” Performance Management practice and the “harmonious instrumental” Performance Management practice. In the third chapter, I build on the results of the two previous empirical chapters to conceptualize an integrated multilevel model for the transnational transfer of Human Resource Management practices in Multinational Enterprises by expanding another central concept to sociomaterial theory: the notion of “apparatus”. This dissertation aims therefore at contributing both to International Human Resources Management literature and to the literature of the sociology of management tools."
The first chapter studies how the introduction of a futures market for steel affects steel producers and their customers. The second chapter asks how import tariffs in upstream industries affect downstream firms’ incentives to invest. The third chapter studies how managerial ownership affects performance in the mutual fund industry.
"This thesis is divided into three chapters. The first one deals with Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs) and their resiliency in crisis times. This is a joint work with François Derrien, Evren Ors and David Thesmar. Focusing on CCPs backed repo trades during the eurozone crisis, we show that the market factored in the default of CCPs. In turn, this affected their capacity to ensure liquidity in the interbank market. Our results have strong consequences for the way CCPs should be regulate. The second chapter aims at quantifying the impact of the rise of the concentration in the banking sector on aggregate credit fluctuations. Building on novel empirical approach, I show that big players’ idiosyncratic shocks have a limited impact on aggregate credit. The explanation lies in the fact that the strength of banking groups idiosyncratic shocks is limited compared to aggregate and subsidiaries level ones. The last chapter, a joint work with Thomas Bourveau and Adrien Matray, focuses on the transmission of corporate risk culture. We show that subsidiaries of the same banking group tend to assess future risks in similar ways. In turn, this gives insights on how banking crisis can spread be fueled by corporate risk culture."
"In this dissertation, I examine the influence of aversive states (e.g., unpleasant emotions, undesired outcomes) on consumers’ motivations and behaviors. In essay 1, I explore how feelings of physical and moral disgust can be threatening to consumers’ sense of self and motivate them to engage in compensatory consumption. In essay 2, I investigate why and when consumers exhibit negative behavioral intentions against firms that terminate unconditional business-to-consumer gift-giving initiatives. In essay 3, I explore how loneliness affects consumers’ preferences for products and services that do or do not require interpersonal touch and interaction (e.g., getting a massage vs. shopping online). Together, the three essays contribute to the literature on emotion, identity threats, and compensatory consumption, to the literature on sales promotion, and to the literature on loneliness. Moreover, the research findings inform marketing practice in the fields of advertising, sales promotions design, and consumer haptics. Finally, this research provides insights into consumer welfare by bringing attention to the unforeseen consequences of marketers’ actions that seek to benefit the consumers but instead generate compensatory behaviors to cope with their aversiveness."
"This thesis studies international trade, monetary policy and international macroeconomics. Chapter 1 examines the different characteristics of different fixed exchange rate regimes and assesses the effects of each of these characteristics on international trade. It appears that price transparency and transaction costs linked to the currency changes do not have a significant effect on trade; only the credibility of the fixed exchange rate regime (due to the absence of devaluation possibilities) increases trade significantly. This explains why only monetary union increases trade between its members from the first years of the exchange rate regime. Chapter 2 looks at the effects of the euro on trade during the 2008-2009 financial crisis.It seems that the euro amortized the trade drop observed throughout the world, owing to the absence of exchange rate volatility among its members. Chapter 3 presents a theoretical model to study the transmission of shocks in a vertically specialized economy, and proposes an optimal monetary policy to stabilize the economy. The model promotes symmetrical monetary policies between the two countries sharing a production mode based on global value chains."
"The uptake of affordable solar PV panels challenges the way in which costs of distribution networks are recuperated from consumers. Historically, consumers were charged for the use of the distribution network mainly according to their (net) volume of electricity consumed over a period of time. With such volumetric network charges, consumers installing PV panels contribute a lot less towards the recuperation of network costs. However, these consumers (prosumers) still rely on the network as much as they did before. The question investigated in this thesis is how to re-design the distribution network tariff in this changing context. Different game-theoretical models are developed to conduct this analysis. In the models, not only investments in solar PV but also investments in batteries at the consumer-side are considered.  The thesis consists of a brief overview followed by four standalone chapters and a conclusion."
"The tougher current competitive environment, the decreasing trend in public subsidies and the new consumer expectations of sports activities are forcing the business models of Olympic sports federations to evolve.Split apart between the need to deliver successful performances at world events, notably the Olympic games, in order to project an attractive image thanks to the media coverage and that of the of promoting the sport for everyone in order to increase membership, Olympic federations seek new competitive leavers.The ambition of this research has been to study the way in which they integrate competitive positioning marketing initiatives in their development strategy.How to increase members’ loyalty? How to attract more spectators and fans? How to assert the Federation brand worth for their partners and the media? We have analysed how Olympic federations, very different from each other, apply classic marketing models differently.This has lead us to deem the sports federations as brands in their own right, in relation to what they aim to build as an emotional relationship (members, spectators, partners)  which goes beyond mere usage of the product.But, the ethics of what should be an Association and the mind set of being a benevolent institution, ingrained in the federations DNA to varying degrees but still very prevalent amongst their elected executive, is a hindrance to the building of a genuine Federation brand.This is why we have proposed, based on three different types of federations, different development models using classical marketing stages.Caught in-between a utilitarian ethic (and therefore of a commercial nature) and the ethics of an association (closer to the ethics of sport), the federations have no other alternative than to embrace a business attitude, opening their organisations to a marketing approach, economic viability and managerial efficiency whilst taking into account the different specific requirements of their sport on the marketing matrix.The planning of the Paris Olympic Games in 2024 welcomes a passionate period where one of the stakes will be to measure its impact over the development model of the federations."
"The aim of this thesis, composed of four academic papers, is to apply empirical and theoreticalanalyses to study the involvement of central banks in financial stability-confidence in the financial system's ability to facilitate allocation of economic resources, manage risks, and withstand shocks -and to discuss their recent macroprudential responsibilities. The global financial crisis (GFC) shitied the perspective of financial regulation - rules that financial institutions have to comply with in order to ensure effective risk management and to with stand financial shocks - and supervision - ensuring that financial institutions follow these rules - from a microprudential perspective based on the resilience of individual institutions to amacroprudential (henceforth · ""MaP"") perspective. The MaP perspective takes into account the interactions of financial institutions, the externalities related to their decisions, and also the effects of the financial cycle on central bank policy and financial stability. This thesis analyses the policy mix of monctary and macroprudential policies which both have an impact on price stability and financial conditions and which operate through common or overlapping channels. A particular focus is given to the role of MaP policy in heterogeneous monetary union such as the Eurozone- where countries are experience in different macroeconomic conditions - in terms of financial and macroeconomic stabilisation. Since a single interest rate is unlikely to fit circumstances in all countries, MaP policy could compensate the Jack of autonomous monetary policy in each country as both policies share many transmission channels. This enhances the optimality's degree of the currency area."
"Our thesis consists in explaining, by bringing some theoretical elements, the imperfections of EBA / BCE macro-prudential stress tests, and proposing a new methodology of their application as well as two specific stress tests in addition. We show that macro-prudential stress tests may be irrelevant when the two basic assumptions of the Gordy-Vasicek core model used to assess banks regulatory capital in internal methods (IRB) in the context of credit risk (asymptotically granular credit portfolio and presence of a single source of systematic risk which is the macroeconomic conjuncture), are not respected. Firstly, they exist concentrated portfolios for which macro-stress tests are not sufficient to measure potential losses or even ineffective in the case where these portfolios involve non-cyclical counterparties. Secondly, systematic risk can come from several sources; the actual one-factor model doesn’t allow a proper repercussion of the “macro” shocks. We propose a specific credit stress test which makes possible to apprehend the specific credit risk of a concentrated portfolio, as well as a specific liquidity stress test which makes possible to measure the impact of liquidity shocks on the bank’s solvency. We also propose a multifactorial generalization of the regulatory capital valuation model in IRB, which allows applying macro-stress tests shocks on each sectorial portfolio, stressing in a clear, precise and transparent way the systematic risk factors impacting it. This methodology allows a proper impact of these shocks on the conditional probability of default of the counterparties of these portfolios and therefore a better evaluation of the capital charge of the bank."
"This dissertation studies the employment effects of cash transfers in a segmented labor market. The first and main chapter shows that an unconditional cash transfer program targeted at mothers has lasting positive impacts on job quality. Five years after having received the cash transfer, treated mothers are more likely to be employed in the formal sector. This appears to be the result of changes in the way recipients search for a job, as treated mothers are unemployed for longer and target better jobs. The second chapter shows the employment effects of a reform in the means-tested, non-contributory pension system of South Africa, which lowered the age of retirement from 65 to 60 for men. The reform caused a large extensive-margin response, as informal workers stop working when they become eligible to the pension. Instead, formal workers do not quit their jobs nor switch to the informal sector to become eligible to the pension. Lastly, this dissertation discusses the lack of self-employment in South Africa. Building on the results of the first two chapters, the last chapter shows that South Africans do not increase entry to self-employment as a result of cash transfers. This indicates that liquidity constraints are not the main reason for the lack of self-employment in South Africa, which is likely to have historical roots stemming from Apartheid. The chapter discusses evidence and potential policy implications of this explanation, alongside possible avenues for future research on this phenomenon."
"French football and European football in general regularly report of financial difficulties and even bankruptcies of professional clubs. Between 1975 and 2018, 81 clubs of the four premier French divisions went bankrupt. The issue of bankruptcy in business has been widely studied in the main sectors of the economy. Various studies have endeavoured to build prediction models and subsequently, other work has investigated the process and different ways of going bankrupt.The only work which investigated French football applied Altman’s prediction model (2000) to Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 clubs and aimed to identify the factors which lead to bankruptcy. Privileged access to financial information concerning these clubs and to people who have important roles in this domain allowed us tocreate a new model to predict bankruptcy which is adapted to the particularities of professional football. We then completed our study with qualitative analysis of the data and a proposal of a hierarchy of the explicative factors and their sequencing in what is a dynamic process. Our thesis concludes by stating that it is impossible to generalise a bankruptcy prediction model for all theclubs in each of the top four French divisions. Nevertheless, the improvements brought forward by our model allows for a more accurate division of the financially healthy and unhealthy clubs in the first three divisions. Equally, we show that beyond the initial score a club achieves with our model, the evolution of this score over time in an important indicator to help clubs anticipate a worsening financial situation; clubs do not suddenly go from a state of financial solvency to one of bankruptcy. Interviews undertaken with the executives, stakeholders and financial directors of clubs as well as those carried out with members of the Direction Nationale du Contrôle de Gestion (DNCG) allowed us to model the global dynamic for clubs who go bankrupt. From there, we propose a new approach to financial regulation to avoid more football clubs going bankrupt."
"By 2018, about one billion people were living without electricity. The extension of electrical grids is facing many challenges that jeopardize the sustainability of traditional electrification. Decentralized Electrification Projects (DEP) now offer feasible solutions for offgrid access to electricity in developing countries. This thesis explores the role of the demand for reliability of the electricity service as a determinant of sustainable extension of the electrical grid, and the efficiency of electricity supply by DEP to achieve the sustainable development goals. With data on outages observed by households in Kenya, the first chapter establishes the households' preference for the reliability of electricity service, which could be the major lever for effective network expansion. In the second chapter, a meta-analysis consolidating 112 decentralized project evaluations shows that technology, capacity and governance support the design choices that are most critical to achieving the sustainable development goals. The third chapter explores the range of objectives achieved by decentralized electrification practices. The most effective are those that address productive uses and public services, as well as micro-networks in remote areas, which have positive impacts on information and communication. The likelihood of positive impacts increases with the capacity of solar home systems, which favor health and education."
"This dissertation is made of three distinct chapters. The first chapter examines the causal link between banks’ syndicated loan supply and non-financial firms’ campaign contributions for US elections during the 2007-2008 financial crisis. The results indicate that a 10% decrease in loan supply of a given firm by its pre-crisis relationship lenders during the early crisis period leads to a 9% increase in firm’s campaign contributions in 2008. Further, firms’ level of past campaign contributions is positively associated with favorable loan terms for the future. The findings lend support to the idea that campaign contributions are an investment in political capital rather than merely a form of consumption good. The second chapter identifies the effect of banks’ industry exposures prior to market-entry on the output growth of manufacturing sectors through US bank-entry deregulations. The findings indicate that the larger the discrepancy in specialization in an industry between a state-pair, the higher the impact of banking integration on the growth of that sector in the state that is less-specialized. The last chapter examines whether banking integration across regions has any impact on the market for corporate control between them. The results show that there are more Mergers and Acquisitions and divestitures across state-pairs whose banking systems have experienced a higher integration, compared to state-pairs with no such integration. The findings in the last two chapters indicate a banking channel that shapes the states’ industrial landscape."
"World economic losses due to natural disasters have increased faster than GDP in the last three decades because risky regions have sustained growing population and low prevention measures. Moreover, only a third of these losses are insured and the low penetration of insurance generates undesirable wealth fluctuation for affected population. In this context and in the perspective of climate change, reducing natural disaster losses and increasing insurance coverage have become main challenges for our societies, which are addressed in the present thesis. Low current levels of prevention measures and insurance coverage can be explained by the numerous market imperfections and poorly designed public policies, as detailed in the introductive chapter of the dissertation. It is thus crucial to better understand these market failures and the role of public policies to improve both of them. Chapter 2 investigates preventive behaviors in the context of city development. By featuring an urban model, it shows that riskier areas are developed nearer to the city center than further away, investment in building resilience leads to more concentrated cities and riskier areas get lower household density and higher building resilience. Moreover, insurance subsidy leads to risk over-exposure through increase of density in the riskiest areas and general decrease of resilience. This analysis highlights the negative effects of subsidization and the role that can be played by urban policies such as density restrictions and building codes. The following chapters deal with risk sharing in the context of risk correlation, a main feature of natural disaster risks. In a model of a risky economy with potential risk dependence between individuals, chapter 3 shows that Pareto optimal allocation of risks can be reached thanks to stock insurance companies in competition and a reduced number of financial assets. This result, which is valid without market imperfections, requires in particular that agents be fully liable for their contracts in each state of nature. In practice, to limit the default on liabilities in catastrophic states, public policies require agents to secure financial reserves. Chapters 4 and 5 investigate the issue of risk correlation when securing financial reserves is costly. Chapter 4 analyzes how the probability of a risk affects the purchase of insurance by risk-exposed individuals. It demonstrates that individuals are more inclined to insure for low-probability risks than for high-probability risks with standard insurance costs, but result is reversed when reserve related costs are added. Chapter 5 examines the optimal design of insurance contracts when individual risks are correlated in a community. It shows that the optimal contract consists in partial insurance against individual risk, with a lower indemnity in catastrophic states than in normal states, and potentially some dividend in normal states. The last chapter concludes by opening on further possible research related to prevention and insurance of natural disasters."
"What economic and policy framework would foster a transition in the European transport sector from fossil fuels to hydrogen in the long term (2030-50)? This research combines empirical and theoretical approaches and aims to answers the following questions:1.	How to design appropriate policy instruments to solve inefficiencies in hydrogen mobility deployment?2.	How to define abatement cost and an optimal launching date in the presence of learning-by-doing (LBD)?3.	How to define an optimal deployment trajectory in presence of LBD and convexity in investment costs?The paper ‘Transition Towards a Hydrogen-Based Passenger Car Transport: Comparative Policy Analysis‘ draws a cross-country comparison between policy instruments that support the deployment of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV). The existing policy framework in favour of FCEV and hydrogen infrastructure deployment is analysed. A set of complementary ex-post policy efficiency indicators is developed and calculated to rank the most active countries, supporters of FCEV. Denmark and Japan emerge as the best providers of favourable conditions for the hydrogen mobility deployment: local authorities put in place price-based incentives (such as subsidies and tax exemptions) making FCEV more financially attractive than its gasoline substitute, and coordinate ramping-up of their hydrogen infrastructure nationally.The paper ’Defining the Abatement Cost in Presence of Learning-by-doing: Application to the Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle’ models the transition of the transport sector from a pollutant state to a clean one. A partial equilibrium model is developed for a car sector of a constant size. In this model the objective of the social planner is to minimize the cost of phasing out a stock of polluting cars from the market over time. The cost includes the private cost of green cars production, which are subject to LBD, and the social cost of carbon, which has an exogenous upward trend. During the transition, the equalization of marginal costs takes into account the fact that the current action has an impact on future costs through LBD. This paper also describes a suboptimal plan: if the deployment trajectory is exogenously given, what is the optimal starting date for the transition? The paper provides a quantitative assessment of the FCEV case for the substitution of the mature Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. The analysis concludes that the CO2 price should reach 53€/t for the program to start and for FCEV to be a socially beneficial alternative for decarbonizing part of the projected German car park in the 2050 time frame.The impact of LBD on the timing and costs of emission abatement is, however, ambiguous. On the one hand, LBD supposes delaying abatement activities because of cost reduction of future abatement due to LBD. On the other hand, LBD supposes starting the transition earlier because of cost reduction due to added value to cumulative experience. The paper ‘The Role of Learning-by-Doing in the Adoption of a Green Technology: the Case of Linear LBD’ studies the optimal characteristics of a transition towards green vehicles in the transport sector when both LBD and convexity are present in the cost function. The partial equilibrium model of (Creti et al., 2015) is used as a starting point. For the case of linear LBD the deployment trajectory can be analytically obtained. This allows to conclude that a high learning induces an earlier switch towards green cars in the case of low convexity, and a later switch in the case of high convexity. This insight is used to revisit the hydrogen mobility project in Germany. A high learning lowers the corresponding deployment cost and reduces deepness and duration of the, investment ‘death valley’ (period of negative project’s cash flow). An acceleration of exogenously defined scenario for FCEV deployment, based on the industry forecast, would be beneficial to reduce the associated transition cost."
"This dissertation is made of three distinct chapters. In the first chapter, which is joint with Edouard Challe, we analyse the joint determination of price informativeness and the composition of the market by order type in a large asset market with dispersed information. The market microstructure is one in which informed traders may place market orders or full demand schedules and where market makers set the price. Market-order traders trade less aggressively on their information and thus reduce the informativeness of the price; in a full market-order market, price informativeness is bounded, whatever the quality of traders’ information about the asset’s dividend. When traders can choose their order type and demand schedules are (even marginally) costlier than market orders, then market-order traders overwhelm the market when the precision of private signals goes to infinity. This is because demand schedules are substitutes: at high levels of precision, a residual fraction of demand-schedule traders is sufficient to take the trading price close to traders’ signals, while the latter is itself well aligned with the dividend. Hence, the gain from trading conditional on the price (as demand-schedule traders do) in addition to one’s own signal (as all informed traders do) vanishes. We then apply this idea in the second chapter of this dissertation. Speculators contemplating an attack (e.g., on a currency peg) must guess the beliefs of other speculators, which they can do by looking at the stock market. This chapter examines whether this information-gathering process is stabilizing by better anchoring expectations or destabilizing by creating multiple self-fulfilling equilibria. To do so, we study the outcome of a two-stage global game wherein an asset price determined at the trading stage of the game provides an endogenous public signal about the fundamental that affects traders’ decision to attack in the coordination stage of the game. The trading stage follows the microstructure of the first chapter. Price execution risk reduces traders’ aggressiveness and hence slows down information aggregation, which ultimately makes multiple equilibria in the coordination stage less likely. In this sense, microstructure frictions that lead to greater individual exposure (to price execution risk) may reduce aggregate uncertainty (by pinning down a unique equilibrium outcome). Finally, in the third chapter, joint with Victor Lyonnet, we present a model of the interactions between traditional and shadow banks that speaks to their coexistence. In the 2007 financial crisis, some of shadow banks’ assets and liabilities have moved to traditional banks, and assets were sold at fire sale prices. Our model is able to accommodate these stylized facts. The difference between traditional and shadow banks is twofold. First, traditional banks have access to a guarantee fund that enables them to issue claims to households in a crisis. Second, traditional banks have to comply with costly regulation. We show that in a crisis, shadow banks liquidate assets to repay their creditors, while traditional banks purchase these assets at fire-sale prices. This exchange of assets in a crisis generates a complementarity between traditional and shadow banks, where each type of intermediary benefits from the presence of the other. We find two competing effects from a small decrease in traditional banks’ support in a crisis, which we dub a substitution effect and an income effect. The latter effect dominates the former, so that lower anticipated support to traditional banks in a crisis induces more bankers to run a traditional bank ex-ante."
"The electric vehicle (EV) market in China is booming, but Western manufacturers are struggling to deploy their models in the world’s largest automotive market. However, carbon credits generated by EV sales are necessary for the survival of their gasoline car business in this market. Thus, what are the high potential strategic opportunities for foreign manufacturers?In collaboration with Renault and based on five missions in China between 2012 and 2016, this CIFRE research first draws a state of the art of the opaque EV market in China, a market generated top-down by government initiatives and bottom-up by a low-cost and illegal EV market (Micro EV). We make a typology of models, usages, prices and deployment territories. While the subsidized market – except for premium cars – fails to appeal to consumers, it is instead at the bottom of the official market and within the illegal Micro EV market that a natural market is developing, with more than a million Micro EV sold, without purchase incentives, to private owners since 2009.In this specific institutional context and taking into account this double product and market uncertainty, we build on innovative design theories to develop a theoretical framework for strategic exploration based on the systematic combination of strategic variables and their evaluation. We identify two innovative routes not yet engaged by foreign manufacturers: ""electric carsharing"" and ""low-cost VE"".On the ""electric car sharing"" side, we compare Autolib’ (Paris) and United Journey (Shenzhen), two self-service stations-based systems that seem to pave the road to the mobility of the future and definitely attract the attention of Chinese authorities because of the technologies involved. However, in addition to the fragility of the business models, this opportunity seems difficult for foreign firms to pursue due to local protectionism and the complexity of public-private partnerships in China, often based on networks of informal institutions.On the ""low cost EV"" side, we are deepening our knowledge of the illegal micro EV market. A field survey in Shandong Province characterizes the market as well as the regulatory scenarios of its legalization. This market responds to real mobility needs in Chinese lower-tier cities. These territories’ socio-technical environments demonstrate strong compatibility with EV. There are fewer gas stations and public transportation systems than in big cities, and parking is easier. Micro EV are charged thanks to conventional 220 V outlets – which essentially solves the problem of charging infrastructures – and allow a true proximity mobility that is more efficient than electric two-wheelers. But the forces in favor of legalizing the Micro EV market have the potential to destroy it, injecting technology and standards, and thus raising prices. An opportunity, it seems, for Western players mastering design-to-cost methodologies.Finally, we characterize the globalization of Renault's EV program in China, within the triple alliance with Nissan and the Chinese partner Dongfeng, as well as the organizational ambidexterity that accompanies it. After attempts to ""exploit"" the existing EV range in China, the President of the Renault-Nissan Alliance initiates the launch of an ""exploratory"" project, Kwid EV, a low-cost EV for China. This is the opportunity for this research to contribute to the initial hypotheses about the lower-end of the Chinese EV market and to characterize the lineage hybridization that takes place at Renault, between the EV lineage (European EV) and the low-cost lineage (Kwid in India), between two disjoined parts of the organization. The world becomes a testing ground for networked innovation, with test markets like China. Then, the goal is to make this first shot succeed before reversing the innovation."
"This thesis focuses on how social impact assessment is built and implemented within nonprofit organizations. At the crossroads of management accounting and organizational theory, it aims to contribute to the research on third sector organizations which have been little studied in management science until now.In recent years there has been a broad consensus on the need to measure the value for society produced by socially-oriented organizations. This measure should enable these organizations to report on the fulfillment of their mission to their stakeholders and to monitor their activities. Despite the willingness of several institutional actors, no standard or consensus has yet emerged on how to assess the social impact of nonprofit organizations. Thus stakeholders face with many questions about the content and the relevant tools to implement. Moreover, the implementation of an evaluation in line with funders' expectations at the expense of other stakeholders’ expectations and more generally the influence of the business sphere on social impact measurement raise questions about the coherence between social impact measurement and specificity of non-profit organizations.These challenges led us to choose to focus on the construction of actual practices of social impact measurement in nonprofit organizations. We chose to study more specifically the articulation between the technical aspects and the context of social impact measurement. To analyze this, we rely on the notion of rationality. The thesis is also based on the academic work on measuring the performance of non-profit organizations on the one hand and on the literature on management tools and socio-material devices on the other hand.The methodology of the thesis is an intervention research. For three years, the Ph.D. candidate acted as a project coordinator on social impact measurement at Apprentis d'Auteuil, a large French foundation dedicated to youth facing social difficulties. Empirical data is divided in two parts: an organizational level that corresponds to the process of reflection and deployment of social impact measurement within the organization as a whole, and a project level consisting of five social impact evaluations of specific entities inside the organization. This double observation level allows an analysis of various dynamics of social impact measurement within the organization.The results of the thesis are divided into three parts. First, we propose an analytical framework which enables to position both existing social impact measurement tools and organizational practices of social impact measurement. Secondly, we show that the implementation of social impact assessment results in a multi-rationality, combining instrumental rationality with other forms of rationality. This combination of rationalities is analyzed in the judgment of external actors, representation of the entity evaluated and the measurement process itself. Third, we show that social impact assessment can be considered a rational myth. This rational myth allowed the appropriation of the idea without the deployment of a standardized evaluation tool. This appropriation enables a meaningful implementation for the actors in conformity with the specificities of nonprofit organizations."
"In many economic environments, producers need to deal with intermediaries to supply their products on markets. Examples include grocery markets in which food manufacturers sell their products to retailers who have direct access to final consumers; pharmaceutical industries where manufacturers distribute their drugs on markets through drugstores; multichannel television industries where cable channels sell their programs to multichannel video program distributors who then charge fees to consumers; private healthcare sectors in which medical providers (e.g., hospitals) deal with insurers to have access to sick patients. One particular feature of such industries is that they are often characterized by a bilateral oligopolistic structure with a small number of firms operating on both sides of the market, resulting in complex vertical relationships. Contracting externalities are indeed intrinsic to such environments because the value generated by a transaction and shared between a manufacturer and a retailer generally depends on the contracting decisions of other firms operating on the market. A number of practices, commonly referred to as vertical restraints, may also arise such as exclusive dealing, bundling and tying, resale price maintenance, or quantity discounts. Furthermore, trading terms are mostly determined through a bargaining process between upstream and downstream firms rather than being fixed by one-side of the market. My research consists in analyzing how vertical relationships between firms in such complex settings impact consumer surplus and total welfare. To this end, I rely on both theoretical models and empirical methods to derive predictions of the effects of contractual arrangements within the supply chain. In the first chapter of this dissertation I design a structural framework to analyze manufacturer-retailer relationships in bilateral oligopolies with differentiated products. Our approach contrasts with most prior empirical models of bargaining and allows to identify the division of surplus between firms without data on wholesale contracts and marginal costs. The second chapter investigates the economic effects of alliances formed by retailers to negotiate common prices and purchase products from manufacturers. I use household- level scanner data on bottled water purchases and estimate a structural model of demand and supply. I perform simulations to study the economic effects of three buyer alliances that have been formed by competing retailers in the French food retail sector. Results show that the bargaining power of retailers is weakened, total industry profit decreases, and final consumers face higher prices. The third chapter examines the case of full-line forcing as a foreclosure device in vertically related markets. We consider a setting in which a multi-product manufacturer offers a leading brand and a secondary brand for which it competes with a more efficient single-product firm. We show that full-line forcing is an efficient bargaining strategy as it allows the multi-product manufacturer to affect threat points and impose its brand portfolio on the retailer’s shelves therefore excluding the rival supplier. This strategy arises in equilibrium under three conditions (i) the leading brand of the multi- product firm is strong enough, (ii) the inefficiency on the secondary brand is not too severe, and (iii) the rival supplier is powerful enough in its bargaining with the retailer. Our results suggest that final consumers and total welfare may be harmed whereas, in some cases, the retailer benefits from such a foreclosure strategy."
"This work investigates managerial dynamics of customer participation and its evolution in financial context. We are interested in managerial dynamics because most of the studies related in co-production is about consumers and the current literature on co-production lacks empirical investigations in financial services. Despite its increasing popularity in the last decade co-production is not a new phenomenon. Customer participation has existed since a very long period of time especially in services marketing and is still evolving in different industries. The following definitions have been adopted for this research. Customer participation has been defined as ""the degree to which the customer is involved in producing and delivering the service"" (Dabholkar 1990, p. 484). Lengnick–Hall et al (2000) define co-production as “engaging customers as active participants in the organization’s work”. A comprehensive analysis of marketing literature about co-production and consumer participation issues leads us to four different approaches: a services marketing approach focusing on largely customer participation, a managerial approach that puts the customer at the center of co-creation process, an innovative approach where the customer actively takes part in innovation, a critical approach focusing on working consumer concept. The central question for the research is “How and why do banks engage their customers in co-production? Four constructs have been selected in order to answer this question: motives, processes problems and outcomes. Five European banks have been selected for the study. A detailed multiple case study analysis revealed three different community types: market research communities, Innovation communities, Cooperation communities. Another contribution is about the evolution of these communities in time. Some communities (ING and Cetelem) evolved according to needs and priorities of financial institutions. The analysis of these banks shows that three important dynamics feed building and managing a community in financial context: customer centricity, managerial support and the need for innovation. In addition, these three different community types have different processes. Problems of community management in financial industry are also investigated in detail in order to better answer “how” question. Besides financial, technical and organizational problems, the most important problem seems to be the management of open and harsh criticisms. The second important problem is the efficient community management in financial industry. In addition, internal dynamics, complexity and intangibility of financial services and resistance to change may also complicate effective community management. According to our findings, motives of financial institutions are not much different from motives of other companies. Research, innovation and co-production of new products and services are most common motives. However motives of open communities were different, they were more business related. Main motive for open communities was cost-cutting, besides cost-cutting, increasing consumers’ loyalty, having a closer contact with clients, engaging them and assigning the community new tasks are also important motives. According to our findings, there are also common and different outcomes for these three different communities. As stated several times by Von Hippel (2006) and Kozinets (1999) online communities are efficient mechanisms for marketing research. Our findings also supported their results. Besides, communities are also important in increasing brand awareness (Seraj 2012), visibility and better internal communication and cooperation (Ramasvamy and Gouillart 2010), know-how sharing and breaking down the barriers between different departments."
"This dissertation addresses cloud computing adoption and decision-making issues. It analyzes adoption determinants, discusses cloud services, and compares cloud providers. Cloud computing has both technical and organizational dimensions. Until recently the organizational dimension has received little attention, and cloud computing has essentially been considered from a technical perspective. However, the ""cloudification"" of information systems poses many economic and managerial questions that need to be evaluated. It is therefore important to enrich our understanding of phenomena related to the ""virtualization"" of information, through an examination of their multidimensional characteristics. Overall, this dissertation finds that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, complexity and compatibility are key factors for cloud adoption, It know-how plays also an important role in the decision process; most small cloud providers have more stable and better computing performance than large cloud providers, the performance of CPU impact price significantly. This dissertation contributes a lot to the theoretical and managerial dimensions of cloud computing research, however, there exists more research work to do as the aforementioned research limitations from the perspective of cloud adoption and cloud decision-making. Future research will focus on the limitions of the research."
"In a context of increased globalization and the rise of new forces from so-called emerging markets, multinational corporations (MNCs) have developed new innovation strategies. In particular, one of the most considerable transformations has taken place in their innovation processes. MNCs must now face a multiplication of sources of innovation in terms of research and development (upstream phase of the innovation process). They also have to seize all the opportunities for commercialization and appropriation of innovations on a global scale (downstream phase) through their subsidiaries’ network. The upstream phase of this process is complex and iterative in nature because of the integration of multiple and geographically dispersed knowledge. The result of this peculiarity of the MNC’s innovation process is the embededness of innovation at a local level. This embedding makes the downstream phase also complex, not just a marketing process. Up to now the downstream phase has been centrally conceptualized and disembodied from an organizational point of view through the concepts of diffusion and transfer. These approaches do not capture changes in the MNC’s innovation process and do not succed to frame empirical phenomena such as reverse innovation or the specialisation of subsidiaries in certain phases of the innovation process. It is through the study of a unique case, a large French MNC that we explored and analyzed this downstream phase. Thanks to this work, we have defined an integrative framework: the deployment of innovations. It is a process that includes sequencing of the commercialization of an innovation by subsidiaries located in differentiated local contexts and requiring each time to be adapted. This deployment is thus both spatial, because the innovation is utilized in different geographies, and temporal, because adaptations may take place over time. Deployment is therefore a concept that has a descriptive scope (understanding the downstream phase) but can also be utilized by companies (the means to be implemented to optimize this downstream phase). Our main results are based on three levels of analysis. First, at the level of deployment projects and communities to better understand the articulation of deployment between the organization and individuals. Then we put the stress on the skills needed for deployment with the idea that the MNCs must now think of a project deployment function. Finally, on the innovation strategy of MNCs, where we put the role of headquarter and subsidiaries in perspective."
"The thesis focuses on public investment policy in Tunisia through borrowing. The objective isto study the question of public debt under its triple economic, institutional and financial naturein the case of a colonial economy. The approach followed is based on a three-partchronological plan that reflects the evolution of Tunisia's public investment strategy. The firstpart, which covers the 1920s, is marked by the issuance of a loan issued by tench. Thepriorities of public investment are to finance the construction of a modern economicinfrastructure. Funding for social investment remains largely insufficient. Private capital inTunisia is experiencing some stagnation.The second part concerns the 1930s coinciding with the great economic depression. Thecolonial authorities decided to simplify the methods of indebtedness, which mainly benefitedthe public institutions of Tunisia. A difficult economic decade which affects the volume ofpublic investment by way of borrowing. Private capital is experiencing a sharp decline, hencethe intervention of public credit institutions.The third part runs from 1945 to 1956; A period marked by the adoption of a new economicstrategy based on planning. Colonial authorities in Tunis choose to diversify sources offunding. Due to its construction, this thesis draws up a diagram of the Tunisian economyunder the French protectorate between 1920 and 1956."
"The objective of this research is to re-evaluate the debates around the sustainability of development based on the exploitation of raw materials by analysing the recent dynamics of commodity prices in a long-term perspective. This research is based on the hypothesis that the entry of commodity prices into a high price regime would constitute an opportunity for emergence for a change in the sustainable development trajectory of West African economies. Indeed, in the early 2000s, West African countries resumed economic growth, averaging 6 % annually (OECD, 2013). This renewed growth is taking place in an external and internal context of the implementation of new regulatory methods in the primary sector. But above all, the renewal of West African growth has taken place in a context of rising commodity prices leading to booms in the terms of trade and mining rent. Analysis of the impact of the boom on sustainability based on the genuine savings indicator reveals that the West African zone (Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Senegal) is not sustainable in the weak sense, even during the boom. Individually, only Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Senegal have been able to exploit booms in a sustainable way. The other countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Liberia, Mali and Niger) are not sustainable due to the lack of investment in productive capital. This calls into question the quality of institutions in terms of managing the income generated by the boom. The analysis of the impact of institutional quality on genuine savings shows that better institutional quality would ensure the sustainability of the economy in West Africa."
"In this thesis, we study the relevance of using the wavelet methodology to improve the results of the Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM). The equation of this model, the Market Line, establishes a relationship between the returns of a stock and those of the Market. The Beta estimate of this Line provides the sensitivity of the stock to Market’s movements. This parameter is commonly used as a systematic measure of risk for classifying equities. Under the hypothesis of homogeneity of agents behaviours, the investors have same investment horizons, and therefore they estimate a similar Beta without considering their characteristics. Moreover, the Beta is commonly estimated by OLS supposing its stability over time. The various criticisms of the CAPM have led to extensions and improvements that are presented in a first chapter. On the one hand, it appears that, in the model, it is not possible to assess the dynamics of risk over time. On the other hand, it is also impossible to take into account the heterogeneity of the agents. The wavelet appreciation of the time-frequency instability of the CAPM Beta represents the heart of this research. The use of discrete wavelets, in the context of the CAPM, is a usefull methodology to study the risk in the time-frequency domain according differents investing horizons. The application to the French market with daily data from 2005 to 2015 is the main part of this research in the univariate (Chapter 2) and multivariate (Chapter 3) cases. Beta estimated by OLS and those estimated for various horizons, related to frequency decomposition, are significantly different. It is therefore possible to use this type of decomposition to extend the possibilities of risk analysis. The analysis of the time-frequency dynamics of the systematic risk is obtained by associating the Rolling Windows with the discrete wavelets. Despite these improvements, OLS- Betas do not have BLUE properties because of there are anomalies in the estimation residuals. The use of the ARMA-GARCH family processes partially corrects the Beta estimate. So, it is possible to to develop a simple correction of OLS-Beta. The approach developed in Chapter 3 includes the multivariate nature of the regression by considering the addition of explanatory variables in the equation as additional sources of risk. Oil and gold, selected according to an analysis of different works, associated with discrete frequency decompositions lead to the estimation of the Betas of a Time-Frequency Multi-Betas Model. The results confirm the differentiation of parameters across frequency bands and provide a lot of information for risk analysis. In this same chapter, we use continuous wavelets to study in a more precise way the CAPM and its robustness. In this context, the coherence and the phase specify the Equity-Market relationship as well as the weight of Systematic Risk in the total risk. We show that Equity-Market links are neither homogeneous nor unilateral as assumed by the CAPM. The intensity and the direction of the links depend on the time and are differentiated according to the frequencies. Therefore, we propose to use a time- frequency-variable estimation of Beta, which leads to numerous results and information on the time-frequency evolution of risk. This research opens up new perspectives on the evaluation of Systematic Risk and its insertion in new computational  technologies, by their computing capacities, will greatly improve the interpretation of its results."
"The emergence of the new concept of the creative economy, which is now an important part of international trade flows, has benefited countries of all economic levels. The rise of creative industries has strongly influenced production through the formation of competitiveness clusters. This situation is proving to be conducive to the development and diversification of creative goods and services, particularly for small and medium firms. The creative economy can be explained by theories of international specialization in particular from the point of view of services trade and tourism. Thus, the development of these creative industries constitutes a genuine opportunity for international tourism specialization based on a process of cultural innovation and sustained by a transformation of tourism demand. This innovation, based on creativity, creates high added value for creative goods and services as well as absolute advantages, which opens up a new development path for the least developed countries to conquer export markets and reduce poverty."
"The organizational interface remains a little studied object. The research suggests investigating it and understanding the dynamics.The first part clarifies the foundations of the research. Having defined the interface, il creates that the instability of the interfaces results from imbalance in the processes of integration-differentiation. To measure these phenomena, the methodology appeals to two methods: the elaboration and the analysis of a base of verbatim, and a research-intervention.The second part is dedicated to the determiners of the object. She specifies the properties and the activities of the interface, and proposes a modelling. A crossed analysis of 14 interfaces is then explained; three determiners of the regulation in the interface are identified: the degree of uncertainty, the frequency of the interactions and the distribution of the power. On these bases, a typology of the interfaces is proposed: strategic, political, of coordination, and social.The third part deepens the research by the in vivo observation and the transformation of the interfaces. It brings to light their costs of functioning, the fundamental role of their finalization, and shows that the processes of integration and differentiation ask the question of their quality, besides that of their intensity. The hypothesis according to which the piloting of the organizational interfaces improves the équilibration of the integration-differentiation is discussed then experimented. From the first results of experiment, the research identifies levers of piloting of the interfaces and formula of the managerial implications."

"In most real-life choice situations, decision makers cannot predict the outcome of their action with certainty.  Decision theory generally distinguishes between the typical case of risk, in which the probabilities of the different events are objectively known, and the situation of ambiguity, in which the informational context does not allow such objective probability judgment. However, agents are often provided with partial information consisting of past observations, leading to situations beyond the traditional known-unknown probabilities dichotomy.This thesis empirically investigates decision-making under uncertainty when statistical information is available. The first two chapters focus on choice behaviors in the presence of information, i.e., when prospects are described by datasets ex ante. These chapters study the influence of information precision on the perception of ambiguity and on the attitudes towards risk and ambiguity. In the third chapter, I consider the situation in which agents are uninformed and have the opportunity to acquire information. This chapter proposes an experiment designed to explore the individual valuation for additional information."
"The residential choice depends to a certain number of constraints: whether internal to the household or resulting from market distortion, these constraints change considerably the choices set of the households. The first part of the thesis is about the internal constraints to the household. The resulting work is a continuation of the work realized on the family economy and that of decision-making depending on their mobility. The first constraint presented is about the discrimination on the prices in the housing market. The literature has studied in detail the question of the discrimination in access to the housing highlighting a restricted and tacit access to the immigrant households, but no study has ever considered the highlighting of a potential residential discrimination by prices. In this article, we study  the effective rent differences between French natives and immigrants, using the decomposition proposed by Oaxaca & Blinder (1973). We search to explain theses rent differentials by a part attributable to individual choices differences and another due to a discrimination on the housing market based on the data of the 1996 housing survey. Although no discrimination by price has clearly been shown, however some housing characteristics seem more expensive for immigrants. The second part of the thesis presents two constraints intra-households. The first of that is housing occupied by agents before they merge in order to create a household. The literature has deeply studied the residential mobility choices of couples through most of the stages of the life cycle, without including that of the household formation. However, this would allow taking into account the plurality of decision makers inside the household. This chapter offer a collective model of the household formation, measuring the probability that a couple, together, occupies the dwelling occupied by the man single, the one occupied by the woman single, compared to the fact of refuse them both, based on the estimations of a multinomial logit model. We work on the data housing national survey of 2002 which allow us to trace the totality the mobility paths of two agents. We studie the choice of the first household housing in the sense of its initial occupation. The elaboration of the theoretical model, based on a collective type model, where agents realized a negotiation, including the situation where the two may not have to leave the respective homes, in the couple threat points. We propose an enhanced version of the model where we argue that the decision of the collective housing can implied an inefficiency in the futures couple decisions. Although the man housing seems to be a proven choice, wage inequality between men and women, as well as the age difference within the couple tend to significantly influence the couples choice. Then, the housing choice, for a couple, has to take into account the daily travel time between home and workplace. The agents, having a localized job, choose a housing which meets their needs in a region where space occupation is strongly heterogeneous and housing supply is not uniformly distributed. The idea of this article is to measure the impact of agents individual characteristics on the attached decision of the household travel times, as well as how the agents allocated theses movements. The data are these of the French 1999 census of the population, enhanced with communal data and agents travel times. We show that a distinction can be realized between men and women on the attraction to the employment poles and the job stability."
"This thesis analyzes the impact of inheritance taxation on growth and labor supply, considering the diversity of intergenerational family transfers, such that bequests, parent's education spendings or time transfers. These forms of family solidarity generate externalities, which impact growth and labor supply, and affect the effectiveness of tax policies. Concerning inheritance tax which reduces the incentive to save, it can also increase educational investment or time transfers, which can positively affect household productivity and labor supply. For this purpose, we use overlapping generations models with altruism towards offspring. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter studies the impact of public debt on intergenerational transfers and on human capital growth, using a simple tax structure with labor and bequest taxes. In this model, parents augment their children's income through education and bequest. When public debt is not available, we show that the long run growth is higher thanks to an increase of the gap between the two taxes, which underlines the role of inheritance taxation. The second chapter proposes a model with rational altruism textit{`a la} Barro, where time transfers and bequests are available to parents. We analyze a shift from capital income tax towards inheritance tax, leaving constant the capital labor ratio. We show that this reform may increase welfare of all generations. Welfare improvement mainly depends on the effect of the reform on the labor supply. This tax reform is also implemented in the third chapter where we consider that dynasties differ in productivity and altruism. We show that the tax reform increases the welfare of less altruistic dynasties but decreases welfare of the most altruistic one. Extending the model with time transfers and elastic labor supply, we identify situations where the tax reform is Pareto improving."
"According to the strategic CSR theory, corporate social responsibility « CSR », defined as an investment in the quality of relationships with strategic stakeholders, is consistent with the economic goals of the firm. A universal positive correlation between CSR performance and financial performance is hypothesized that raises questions about the process and contingencies through which value creation occurs: if CSR investment is beneficial, can we explain why and how?The Gaïa-Index database, provided by EthiFinance French CSR rating agency covering 230 french small and middle capitalizations from 2011 to 2013 is analyzed to address the research question. The results are consistent with theorical and empirical consensus and the “human factor” is pointed out as a critical determinant in the positive relationship associating CSR and financial performance."
"In this thesis, we study several mathematical finance problems, related to the pricing of derivatives. Using different asymptotic approaches, we develop methods to calculate accurate approximations of the prices of certain types of options in cases where no explicit formulas are available.In the first chapter, we are interested in the pricing of path-dependent options, with Monte-Carlo methods, when the underlying is modelled as an affine stochastic volatility model. We prove a long-time trajectorial large deviations principle. We then combine it with Varadhan’s Lemma to calculate an asymptotically optimal measure change, that allows to reduce significantly the variance of the Monte-Carlo estimator of option prices.The second chapter considers the pricing with Monte-Carlo methods of options that depend on several underlying assets, such as basket options, in the Wishart stochastic volatility model, that generalizes the Heston model. Following the approach of the first chapter, we prove that the process verifies a long-time large deviations principle, that we use to reduce significantly the variance of the Monte-Carlo estimator of option prices, through an asymptotically optimal measure change. In parallel, we use the large deviations property to characterize the long-time behaviour of the Black-Scholes implied volatility of basket options.In the third chapter, we study the pricing of options on realized variance, when the spot volatility is modelled as a diffusion process with constant volatility. We use recent asymptotic results on densities of hypo-elliptic diffusions to calculate an expansion of the density of realized variance, that we integrate to obtain an expansion of option prices and their Black-Scholes implied volatility.The last chapter is dedicated to the pricing of interest rate derivatives in the Levy Libor market model, that generaliszes the classical (log-normal) Libor market model by introducing jumps. Writing the first model as a perturbation of the second and using the Feynman-Kac representation, we calculate explicit expansions of the prices of interest rate derivatives and, in particular, caplets and swaptions"
"My PhD focuses on how information sellers use consumer information to shape competition on product markets.     The three chapters develop theoretical models where the interactions between data brokers specialized in collecting and selling information, firms competing on a product market, and consumers behaving strategically regarding the price they pay and their concern for privacy.     Namely we study first the strategies of data brokers selling information to competing firms allowing them to price discriminate consumers. We show that data brokers do not sell all information about consumers but keep a share of unidentified consumers instead.    We focus then on competition and mergers between data brokers, and we show that competition affects the uses of information in several directions. Competing data brokers collect less information than monopolists, but sell more consumer data. We show that consumers benefit from competition between data brokers regarding the price they pay on the product market, but the effects on their privacy are two fold.     Finally we consider the reactions of consumers who can hide from data brokers and pay a homogeneous price. We show that in order to moderate consumers' willingness to hide, data brokers will identify more consumers on the product market and thus increase competition between firms. Thus the possibility to hide positively affects consumers on the price they pay, as competition is increased, but as more consumers are identified, their privacy concern increases.     Overall, this study answers some key questions on the mechanisms of information collection, and uses by data brokers, how they affect competition on the product market, and how consumers react to it when they are concerned both by the price they pay and by their privacy."
"This thesis aims at providing Bank Audi with an updated tool to understand and investigate in given risk types encountered in their portfolios and the way Basel suggests computing their capital charges. International regulator is constantly changing and modifying previously used approaches to enhance the reflection of the market and banking sector risks. The recent financial crisis played a major role in these reforms, in addition the situation of Bank Audi and the markets it is operating in, represent certain specifications that should be accounted for. The work handles interest rate risk in the trading book, Counterparty Credit Risk faced with derivatives along a closer look on the Credit Valuation Adjustment topic and the incorporation of Wrong Way Risk. The first part discusses the new Fundamental Review of the Trading Book: focusing on the general interest rate risk factor, the paper compared Basel’s Sensitivity Based Approach (SBA) capital charge to more traditional approaches of VaR using several models such as Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and Dynamic Nelson Siegel. Application on portfolios with zero coupon bonds of different sovereigns revealed the divergence in results between stable markets (such as France and Germany), less stable (such as the USA) and emergent markets (such as Turkey). The second part is dedicated to the Counterparty Credit Risk. A new capital charge methodology was proposed by Basel and set as a standard rule in 2014: the Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR). Applying this approach on different derivatives portfolios, we compared it to internal models. The internal methodologies incorporated historical estimations and future projections based on Vasicek and GARCH models. Different hedging cases were investigated on EUR and USD portfolios. The impact of each hedging technique and the difference between IMM and the standardized methods were highlighted in this work: without hedging, the internal approach amends 80% of the standardized capital whereas, in general, the hedging is encouraged more under the standardized approach relatively to its capital reduction under the internal model. The third part remains a part of the Counterparty Credit Risk however, the main focus in this work is the Credit Valuation Adjustment. This topic was neglected in terms of capital charge earlier but due to its important impact is now incorporated as a capital charge amended when no central clearing is put in place when dealing with derivatives. We focus on the regulatory approaches of capital computation, comparing both accepted approaches based on portfolios of interest rate swaps held with investment grade sovereigns. An incorporation of the Wrong Way Risk is another addition in this work: using Error Correction Models we were able to reflect the impact of the correlation between the exposure and the credit quality of the investment grade sovereign we are dealing with. Based on such results, a suggestion of a re-calibrated standardized approach is in place to encourage the use of the CDS as an indicator of the credit quality of the counterparty and not its grade (investment or not) as followed by the new Basel regulations"
"With the implementation of the Solvency II framework, actuaries should examine the good adequacy between models and data. This thesis aims to study several statistical approaches, often ignored by practitioners, enabling the use of multi-state methods to model and manage individual risks in insurance. Chapter 1 presents the general context of this thesis and positions its main contributions. The basic tools to use multi-state models in insurance are introduced and classical inference techniques, adapted to insurance data with and without the Markov assumption, are presented. Finally, a development of these models for credit risk is outlined. Chapter 2 focuses on using nonparametric inference methods to build incidence tables for long term care insurance contracts. Since there are several entry-causes in disability states which are useful for actuaries, an inference method for competing risks data, seen as a Markov multi-state model in continuous time, is used. In a second step, I compare these estimators to those conventionally used by practitioners, based on survival analysis methods. This second approach may involve significant bias because the interaction between entry-causes cannot be appropriately captured. In particular, these approaches assume that latent failure times are independent, while this hypothesis cannot be tested for competing risks data. Our approach allows to measure the error done by practitioners when they build incidence tables. Finally, a numerical application is considered on a long term care insurance dataset"
"The Solvency II directive issued in 2009 by the European Commission has been put into action in January 2016. It is based on three pillars. The first pillar addresses the quantitative requirements to assess the Solvency capital needs. The second pillar, more qualitative, addresses the risks governance. The third pillar addresses the required disclosures. For life insurance, the quantitative requirements (pillar I and a part of pillar II) have introduced a high level of complexity. Indeed, to create an entity-adapted scheme, the directive has developed a very specific process to evaluate the insurance balance sheets, namely the economic valuation. Considering this complexity, most European life insurances have chosen to focus on pillar I, at the beginning of the implementation of the directive, the regulatory capital assessment being an essential part of the solvency scheme. In this thesis I focus my work on the second pillar of the directive and more precisely on the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process. This regulatory tool is the second major source of complexity when implementing the directive. It is a completely undertaking-embedded risk management process which aims to deepen the insurance knowledge of its risks. In my work I have tried to conceptualize and propose operational implementations to answer the ORSA issues (Overall Solvency Needs assessment and continuous compliance). Finally, through a joint work with N. El Karoui, S. Loisel and J.-L. Prigent, we have underlined, analyzed and exemplified some of the major hazard sources induced by the economic valuation"
"This dissertation begins with the observation that informal payments to healthcare professionals in post-soviet health systems persisted well beyond the post-socialist transition and despite the successive waves of health care reform.During this transition period, since the independence of the Republic of Tajikistan, there has been a deterioration of trust towards certain health professionals which has been associated with increased forgone care, especially among vulnerable populations. What is the role played by the different informal payment practices? Are they a source of mistrust or a means of restoring trust? Are informal payments adjusted to patients' standard of living or a source of inequality between patients?According to the equity indicators mobilized and contrary to popular belief, informal payments do not make the system progressive and do not guarantee that there will be access for all. The poorest are more likely to forgo care.To cope with these barriers in accessing care, different strategies are put in place by households: informal solidarity, indebtedness, reliance on traditional medicine, mobilization of social capital.More specifically, we then study if migration, a relatively important phenomenon in Tajikistan, is part of these strategies and to what extent remittances enable beneficiary households to improve their access to healthcare."
"This thesis addresses several aspects of the insurability of catastrophic risks. In a first chapter, we focus on very low probability events and we show how hybrid financial instruments can be used to extend the domain of insurablerisks. Our application to the case of nuclear accidents using cat-bonds data in France shows that despite the higherprice of reinsurance for low probability events, it is advisable to insure more than is currently provided for by the Frenchlaw. The second chapter takes on the issue of why reinsurance is more costly for low probability events. We show thatbecause catastrophic risks have a systemic component, they give rise to a risk premium in equilibrium which decreasesat a lower pace than the willingness to pay for insurance. We use this finding to explain why systemic low probability catastrophes are hard to insure. The third chapter investigates the role of mutual and participating contracts to improveinsurability. Such contracts are necessary for people to adjust their demand for insurance when individual losses are correlated. Finally, the fourth chapter investigates the use of cat-bonds to hedge the risk of extreme agricultural suppliesprice variations. By issuing a cat-bond, the firm that purchases supplies borrows a capital that can be retained in caseof catastrophe. Such a solution would combine the advantage of risk-pooling, to lower the price of insurance, with lowerbasis risk compared to more traditional hedging strategies such as future purchases."
"According to the stakeholders’ theory, Corporate Social Responsibly is the firm’s response to increasing pressure from employees, shareholders, communities, environmental NGOs or regulators to consider the social and environmental consequences of their business activity. What is at stake, is not only a compensation of negative externalities but the adaptation and the participation of firms to a sustainable growth. In that sense, CSR is not just about being efficient but being the best and push firms to be proactive and go beyond legal requirements. But how manage objectives so various and even opposite? While firms start to integrate CSR into their global business strategy, at the top of the decision-making process, corporate governance appears to be the missing link to join economic, environmental and social objectives. This dissertation provides empirical and theoretical evidences of the determining factors involved at the high level of firms’ governance, from the board of directors to the CEO. After an introduction chapter, chapter 2 investigates the link between board composition and integrated CSR strategies. Adopted in 2011, the law targets listed firms and brought about the entrance of new directors, more likely to be women and younger than prior directors. However, we do not find evidence that this diversity is correlated to financial or extra-financial performance. For this chapter, we use a panel composed of French listed companies (SBF120 index) over the 2009-2015 period. If director’s characteristics are involved at the top of the decision making-process, the execution of the strategy and management of the firm is delegated to the CEO. Using variable pay, compensation part determined by performance objectives, the board aligns the CEO’s interests with his own interests. Chapter 3 shows evidence of the effectiveness of CSR based compensation part, labelled under the term “CSR contracting”.  We show that the impact of such compensation depends on the governance structure. For firms who focus on shareholder, CSR contracting is more likely to have a negative impact on financial performance and no impact on extra-financial performance. On the contrary, for firms with a stakeholder model of governance, we show that CSR contracting is effective and have a positive impact on the environmental and social performance without impacting the economic results. This empirical work is conducted on a worldwide dataset with 3500 firms over the 2006-2015 period. Chapter 4 provides a theoretical framework to understand the role of governance factor on the efficiency of incentives. We develop a model based on Che et Yoo (2001) model to study the influence of compensation among a team of two managers who have to work on a CSR task. We determine the optimal compensation between three compensation mixes: both agents receive monetary compensations, both agents receive external rewards from their environment, one agent receives monetary compensation and the other receives an external reward. We show that the choice of the optimal compensation scheme depends on the environment outside the firm, i.e. the level of the exogenous reward, and the environment inside the firm through the level of the interdependence between the managers' decisions which corresponds to the capacity of the firm to create cooperation between the agents. Then, using evidence from executive compensation, we apply this model to the relationship between the CEO and the board of directors and find that the adoption of monetary incentives for CSR tasks is more suitable for firms with a high decisional interdependence than for firms with a lower interdependence. In conclusion, from directors’ characteristics to the overall governance organisation, we retrace the link between corporate governance and CSR integrated strategies; a link who could go beyond firm frontiers and include industry ties and peer effects."
"This thesis aims at clarifying how the precarious dwelling areas generate residential poverty traps. Through multidimensional and multiscale approaches, we demonstrate how some external factors, including the habitat, may contribute to the households’ vulnerability. In fact, studying vulnerability in such areas requires addressing a wide range of factors that determine their capabilities sets when confronted to social, economic or environmental risks. Those latter are particularly numerous in precarious areas and compromise the households’ possibilities to get out of poverty.  We build a typology of  	households’ vulnerability based on cumulative risks. We compare the results from a statistical survey to households’ discourse analyses. As for the statistical database, we refer to a survey conducted for the Participatory Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP) on habitat conditions in the precarious districts of Antananarivo. The discourses are used to carry a retrospective analysis of the households’ trajectories. These approaches will finally allow a reflection on the urban policy designed to fight against the “urban poverty trap effect” and address the challenge of a socially sustainable development."
"The bank is a front-line sector of digital transformation and ranks 4th in the most digitally-transformed sectors behind IT, media and professional services (Gandhi & al, 2016). In addition, the burst of data and the need for real-time processing is a challenge for the players to meet or anticipate the needs of customers. In this way, the digital transformation of banks is emblematic of the opportunities and risks of our digital society.Studies tend to demonstrate that digital performance reflects the company's economic performance (Accenture, 2016b). It is therefore all the more important to carry out its digital transformation in order to remain or become a performing bank, especially since the average mortality of multinationals is only 40 years (Schatt, 2014).The question is where are the banks going to be in the value chain: continuing vertical integration or horizontal integration to diversify, buy or make partnerships with technological players or fintech?The prerequisite may lie in the knowledge of their current digital maturity. The model developed in this thesis makes it possible to highlight the strengths of a banking player and its perfectible points likely to feed the transformation strategy for its leaders and the related priorities. The starting point is the methodology of measuring digital maturity of any kind of organization (Fayon, Tartar, 2014) that has been challenged as part of this thesis work. Its axes, which define digital maturity, have evolved and are there to number six: Organization, Technology and Innovation, People, Offer, Environment, Strategy.The reflection has been focused on the structuring trends of digital transformation, and a focus on the case of the banking sector. She has been nourished by academic work related to the paradigm shift brought by digital technologies and those related to organizational design among others. Two surveys (one on the bank of the future, the other on the expectations of the generations in terms of banking service) and a PoC realized as part of the contactless payment on smartphone at La Poste french company have fueled the reflection to enrich our initial model of measuring digital maturity.To build the model, we have chosen to rely primarily on existing work in both areas at the heart of digital transformation, on the one hand information systems where many methodological tools have been developed (CMMI, ITIL, CobiT, etc.) and secondly marketing. Each of the indicators of the initial model was challenged by relying on the literature in the field as well as on a body of data developed for this thesis work.The scope of this measure is of two kinds. The result can make it possible for the decision makers who seize it - typically the actors of the digital transformation (Executive Committee, CDO, CTO, CMO) – feed the digital transformation strategy of the considered actor (thanks to the calculation of the maturity of the 6 levers and globally of the bank to highlight its strengths and its weaknesses, it is then necessary to exploit them in the service of its strategy). But this measure can also have a performative scope. It allows, as for all devices measuring tools, to give an ""objectivized"" but also ""objectifying"" level reached by each of the indicators and therefore accompany a reflexive process of digital transformation.A number of limitations are inherent to this thesis work in its instrumental dimension in particular. The internal coherence of the model, although tested by different analytical approaches and tests, is not exempt, by construction, from an arbitrary part. The relevance of the model, even if it has been tested partly with some business cases, remains subject to the test of generalization. In addition, the evolving nature of digital technologies and associated societal changes may make some indicators less relevant. But the performative dimension of the model could then remain."
"The thesis deals with the relevant forms of management of innovation projects with a strong systemic, disruptive and digital component, which contribute to the structuring of an ecosystem. Indeed, these types of innovation are becoming more and more numerous given the growing connection of objects / services / companies / public authorities and the resulting new cross-business opportunities.The insights provided by existing literature enable managers to perform strategic decision making when rules of the game are set among known actors, but not when the actors and the environment are progressively defined. Nowadays, managers from private and public institutions need to get aligned with variable internal, external conditions, time perspectives, and ill-defined demand system; they miss guidance on how proceeding with it.  The research questions emerging from empirical and theoretical investigations are the following: 1. How can an ecosystem project be managed? Is there a specific pattern, and which are the variables of project steering? 2.Which are the most strategically performing steering processes for the selection of innovation projects related to ecosystem structuring? Which are the organizational variables and the mediating variables toward eco-systemic structuring? 3. Which are the more adequate management artefacts to support the exploration process in a context of ecosystem project?In order to study the dynamics at work, and to instrumentalise their management, the research work focuses on the case of connected mobility, observed through the participation in three projects, according to the uses defined by the impetus of OEMs, and under the initiatives of users (autonomous vehicle, connected, electric, shared). The projects chosen concern the diffusion of the fast charging infrastructure of the electric vehicle, the creation of a prototype marketplace for the data collected by the vehicles, and the development of services enabled by the autonomous vehicle. All of them constitute a terrain particularly disrupted by the trend of connection, forcing a reconfiguration of actors, their partnership policies, their business model (ex: Uber, Google Car ...). Hence the current need to update existing tools and theories in innovation management. The analysis of the data collected provides elements to answer the research questions. Following the identification of management challenges specific to systemic and disruptive innovation projects, we have developed a framework of analysis and action integrating the three underlying theoretical logic (platform leadership / systemic innovation, disruptive innovation / design driven innovation, digital business model). We have identified and characterized a project typology, the Proto-ecosystem project, which enables stakeholders to create the knowledge, skills and connections that contribute to the structuring of an ecosystem. We have identified the typical process by stage finalized to the alignment of the partners of the observed projects and the more efficient artifacts in this alignment process. We have indicated the limitations of this research and the possible future evolutions."
"The first pawnshop, or ""Mont-de-Piété,"" was created in 15th-century Italy to fight usury. The Mont-de-Piété and its pawn loan unquestionably became a fundamental pillar of social care. It promotes a charitable social economy and regards money as being at the center of all concerns for social and economical integration within a modernising society. It plays the role of a protective institution for wage earners subjected to pauperism and the social hazards of existence. The Mont-de-Piété allows wage earners to supplement their incomes by providing financial capacities when wages are low or uncertain. However the emergence of Social Welfare which stabilised incomes soon competed with the social financing provided by the Mont-de-piété. Thus institutionalised social policies brought a new light on the concept of social aid. 19th-century private and individualised social aid was gradulally replaced by public and global social welfare. Pawnbroking activities decreased significantly and soon the Crédit Municipal will assimilate the logic of banking institutions. However, toward the end of the 20th century the Mont-de-Piété institution comes up again and social microcredit progressively rises up in importance. Since the end of the 20th century, consequences of the liberal economic organization -  such as social exclusion and banking exclusion - the Crédit Municipal activity has (re)developped and evolved. Nowadays, the Crédit Municipal is, just like the Mont-de-Piété used to be, an institution which allows for or facilitates social inclusion. In fact, the Crédit Municipal and its pawnbroking activities are re-establishing a new form of specific social protection."
"In recent years, several states have introduced new corporate forms into their commercial law, which requires the commitment of shareholders towards a “mission”. By stipulating their purposes in their documents, these companies appear as a paradox for literature on corporate governance: would such a commitment not hamper strategic flexibility and undermine the monitoring of management? Is it not likely to deter shareholders' investments? The aim of this thesis is to explain the emergence of ""mission-driven companies"", to understand their motivations, but also to characterize the alternative model of governance they draw and the significance of this model in management science.First, the analysis of the process of emergence and design of these mission-driven forms in the United States enables us to enrich the classical model of the corporate contract, by showing that such a contract can have restrictive effects on the collective purposes if it only contains a commitment on invested resources, or provisions on the distribution of decision rights or value created to stakeholders.The thesis proposes, in a second step, a model of the ""mission"": by specifying desirable, yet potentially inventive, properties of the upcoming collective action, the mission calls for the design of novel strategies aiming at building new commons and collective interests. This model reveals, beyond the new legal forms, a wider class of “mission-driven” organizations, of which we can observe numerous variations both historically and currently.Finally, the thesis examines the systems of governance of mission-driven companies. A study of contrasting cases shows original devices combining control of the strategic exploration and solidarity mechanisms. The mission thus opens fruitful perspectives to explore new possible systems of solidarity."
"The basic premiss of the thesis is that the process of European integration is closely linked with the generalisation of large-scale production and of its organisational form, i.e. big business. This implies that the process unfolds in a pattern that can be traced to the development strategies of large firms. The 1945-1985 period is analysed as the first of twostages in the integration process, that of the transition towards the Europe of big business through the policy of building in each of the member states national champion firms. The thesis concentrates on the second stage, the “post-national champions period” during which large firms europeanise their operations. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the thesis examines the ways in which the often heterogeneous strategies and preferences of large French firms have shaped the integration process in its various manifestations: the emergence of a European corporate elite, the centralisation of microeconomic and macroeconomic policies and the building of a pan-European financial system."
"Cette thèse, consacrée à l’analyse du management interculturel, présente dans la première partie une revue de la littérature afin d’appréhender l’état actuel des recherches dans le domaine du management interculturel. Dans cette perspective, nous abordons les aspects généraux de la gestion des ressources humaines et de la culture d’entreprise, entendus comme des instruments managériaux de gestion des différences culturelles dans une organisation (chapitre 2). Dans les chapitres suivants (3 & 4), l’analyse a porté sur le discours relatif à la différence culturelle et sur l’éthique postsocialiste du travail, entendue comme la principale différence culturelle qui affecte les interactions interculturelles dans les entreprises étrangères en Roumanie. Ces aspects seront davantage développés de manière appliquée dans la deuxième partie. Les chapitres de la deuxième partie de la thèse sont consacrés, d’une part, à l’analyse de la gestion de la différence culturelle dans des petites et moyennes entreprises (PME) implantées en Roumanie et, d’autre part, à une proposition d’ordre méthodologique en vue de l’étude du management interculturel en Roumanie. Ces analyses et ces propositions prennent appui sur l’identification des principales pratiques de management interculturel dans les entreprises multinationales (EMN) actives en Roumanie relevées chez les managers et employés des EMN et sur trois études de cas réalisées sur des PME de l’industrie du textile et du bois avec participation italienne au caprftital social"
"The Gendarmerie nationale is a military institution and one of the two French national police forces, with responsibilities regarding population security in rural and suburban areas. Due to public management reforms and several social movements, this institution is currently experiencing important changes in people management. As a result, the set of game rules that applies to command itself is subject to modifications. The gendarme condition – meaning the entire scale of rights, obligations and missions attached to the position – is evolving and traditional postures, based on disciplinary attitudes and availability standards, are weackened. This study focuses on the day-to-day work of officers in command positions and how these chiefs handle their new situation. Based on an ethnographic approach, the research process analyzes chief-work throught a set of roles, which are discused as means for action in a strategy-based approach. It shows how certain officers in command position choose to reshape the way they make use of their roles, adopting a support based posture rather than a more traditional authority based posture"
"For over thirty years, a great number of appeals have been made to SMEs. Consultancy operations have significantly intensified with regard to these companies, in order to increase their performance. Under the influence of public governance, specific recommendations and support programmes have been proposed to SMEs over the past few decades. Among these, the skills management model, which was presented at the end of the 1990s as the best path to take in order to respond to the challenges companies now face with regard to globalisation and competitiveness. The dissemination of these new organizational norms occurs through a nebula of actors. With regard to these recommendations, what is the role of intermediary organisations, which simultaneously produce and prescribe institutionalized incentive plans for Human Resources Management? Can these plans be seen as actionable? What are the impacts of these approaches on firms, and especially on the smallest firms? Do these consultancy operations modify the practices of the directors of SMEs? Do the prescriptions of consultants always play the same role, or are they incorporated and appropriated differently by company directors, in accordance with a diversity of modes of appropriation adapted to the plurality of organizational structures present in small companies?"
"This thesis, written while working under a CIFRE contract, studies the construction, the implementation and the effects of the gender equality policy at Orange. Using the appropriative perspective of management tools enriched by the concept of institutional logics, this work is based on various data, in particular: interviews, HR data, observations, internal documents. We show that the coexistence of various conceptions of gender equality within the company strongly affects the implementation of the gender equality policy within the entities, but also its construction, for both the collective bargaining agreement and the non-negotiated policy. The joint analysis of the implementation and of the effects of the policy, made possible by a mixed-method design, allows us to understand the quantifiable effects (or the absence of quantifiable effects) of a measure according to the way it is implemented within the entities. We underline the specificities of the collective bargaining about gender equality, notably due to the fact that gender equality cuts across various HR processes. Finally, we show the importance of the coexistence and articulation of the collective bargaining agreement and non-negotiated gender equality policy."
"This thesis aims at studying the tensions that professional service firms (audit firms, consultancies...) have been facing for the past thirty years, through the lens of work-life balance. While these firms are increasingly questioned in the media for their managerial practices that encourage their salaries to excel themselves; they have never been so active in communicating on quality of work-life. Through a review of the literature, I show that the up- or-out incentive system of professional organisations lies on the assumption that professionals all mostly aspire to see their commitment rewarded by bonuses and promotions. Through the analysis of 58 consultants’ career stories, I identify two additional dimensions of their experience at work: the nature of the projects they are assigned and work-life balance. Then, the techniques they use to fulfil these aspirations are described. Second, after studying the managerial discourse on work-life balance in 9 consultancies, through the comparative case study of two firms I analyse the adjustments they have implemented to accommodate individual needs. I discuss the extent to which these evolutions challenge the traditional organisation of professional service firms, at a time when they are increasingly threatened by low levels of growth in the industry; pressure on cost; the sophistication of clients’ demands and the uberisation of the economy, which has also reached professional services."
"The objective of the research is the interpretation of the action of SME managers in the face of sustainable development. Then, interpretation is considered by this research as a dialectical process between explanation and comprehension. To explain the action, we chose the theory of social representations and to understand it, we opted for the theory of the economy of quantities. The research problematic seeks to analyze the links between representation, action and the justification of sustainable development among the riads' leaders in Marrakech. The results obtained show the existence of an ecological city and confirms the difficulties of sustainable development to present itself as an order of justification of the action."
"Since the beginning of the 1980s, the French legislation of workplace industrial relations has faced dramatic transformations. Specifically, collective bargaining procedures with employee representatives have become a central feature of the HR decision-making process, and several reforms intended to reinforce both employee participation and partnership between employers and employee representatives. Such changes raise questions about the role played by employee representatives in shaping human resource practices used in French workplaces, within a specific legal and historical framework. In conjunction, human resources practices based on employee involvement and commitment have developed, and their effects can be regarded as adversarial to employee representatives. Drawing on the theoretical works developed in the fields of industrial relations - namely exit/voice model, strategic choice theory and its extensions - and strategic human resource management, the aim of this doctoral research is to offer an analysis of the influence of the presence, co-presence, activities and strategies of union as well as non-union employee representatives on the use of high performance work practices and systems. As such, we investigate if and to what extend employee representation can be regarded as determinants of human resource practices and systems at the workplace level. A quantitative analysis is conducted on a nationally representative sample of 2,500 French workplaces. The results of logistic regression estimates can be summed up into three main points. First, we note that employee representatives do not prevent the use of high performance work practices and systems. Second, the fact that union and non-union employee representatives show different influence over the use of practices raises questions about new legal features. Third, we show that the influence of employee representatives varies when we turn from the analysis of isolated practices to bundles of practices. This result underlines that high performance work systems have a strategic meaning to both the management and employee representatives."
"This research in ergonomics focuses on the design of robust personnel schedules in a sensitive social context, based on the articulation work between the social and economic dimensions of companies .it is often seen as a lever for flexibility by companies. Research in ergonomics and human resources management shows that it possible to consider scheduling as a ""distributed"" resource management activity, which raises issues related to both the economic and social dimensions of companies (health, skills, training, agent satisfaction). Our objectives are to understand how schedulers articulate theses dimensions, evaluate this work, and to define the robustness on scheduling.To understand this activity, divided between three different levels (strategic, tactical, operational), six types of data collection were carried out: semi-directive interviews, observations of the activity of planners at the tactical level, business and inter-business working groups, as well as self-confrontation interviews based on achieved schedules.The robustness is dynamically built from the constraint management strategies of schedulers. These are based on the schedulers’ knowledge : of regulations, of process, of other schedulers and commercial agents. Robustness takes different forms (stable or flexible, immediate or delayed) and must make it possible to resist disruptions but also to build room for manœuvre for the future.The impact of our research is related to the definition of robustness on personnel scheduling, to the joint collective activity and to the identification of the conditions in favour of robustness’ construction."
"As part of their efforts to modernize the Tunisian companies are looking for a model of effective management of their human resources with, beyond restructuring and flexibility necessary to ensure development of their performance and a career security of their employees. The central hypothesis we have determined as a response to this problem is: the renovation of Human Resource Management, for the establishment of a policy of development of employability, with Tunisian companies to advance their performance social and economic security and career paths for their employees.The results of this research are first identified the major challenges of modernizing human resources management in the Tunisian firms (managerial, structural, institutional and cultural) and the provision of employability development for renovation Human Resource Management practices and increasing social and economic performance in the medium and longer term and finally the conditions for the integration of a development policy employability of HRM."
"This research is about the organizational commitment within a microfinance association after an organizational change. An exit strategy was put in place as part of this change and had an impact on the psychological contracts of the organizational agents and consequently on the relations that bind them to their organization (association).Our objective through the adoption of the psychological contract as a grid for reading AL AMANA's contracts is to explain the processes of evolution of the individual and collective psychological contracts of the organizational agents following the change event which constitutes, as we will see, a critical incident. This will help us to determine the intra-organizational and extra-organizational factors of the evolution of the psychological contracts that impact the resilience observed within the association and allowing it to exit the crisis."
"Skills are complex management objects which are essential to define employers’ needs and draw one’s profile and wishes. Aggregated in positions, jobs, professions, they form a transactional framework in a space of abstract artefacts and their links. This thesis aims to assert the centrality of a mapping device by examining: the benefits of a clearing of this space, especially trough digital transformation; the indispensable support of technological artefacts to help a person or a group, to identify, decide, evolve in this space; the role of cartographer to be taken by the human resources function. The research is based on a professional career in the field of human resources and methodologically, crosses needs around the notion of competence with the contributions of modern cartography (GIS, geomatics, data visualisation). It leads to a synthesis by the design of a SaaS platform demonstrator, and a cartographic methodology for abstract space."
"French universities have undergone recent transformations through reforms inspired by New Public Management. The deployment of a new national budgetary framework ("" LOLF "") followed by the LRU law ("" Liberté et Responsabilité des Universités "") in 2007 led to the transfer of new responsibilities to universities, including Human Resources Management (HRM): researchers and ""professionals"" (""BIATSS""). While research work has been devoted to the former, the latter has been studied much less frequently, particularly from the perspective of HRM policies and practices dedicated to them.This research, funded through a CIFRE agreement with Adoc Mètis, aims at understanding the reality of the autonomy of French universities in managing their BIATSS staff. Thus, it takes stock of the effects of the LRU law on this matter, ten years after its adoption. More generally, it can contribute to discussing the reality of public HRM transformations in France, in the light of the model promoted by the reformers: from national and statutory personnel administration practices, the aim is to develop local management based on skills.Conducted within two universities, our research relies on a study of the appraisal interviews conducted by BIATSS staff, at the heart of the desired transformations of public HRM. Our methodology therefore considers appraisal interviewing as a management tool that reveals several HRM processes, linked to the three objectives set out by law: assessment of objectives, management of staff skills and training, and decisions about promotion. Given these aims, we propose to understand the perception and uses of interviewing by staff, both at the local level (within four departments) and at the ""central"" level (Directorate of Human Resources and promoting committees).Our results first of all question the coherence of  appraisal interviews, both internally (lack of consistency of the targets with the assessment methods) and externally (limited integration of the interview with the production of decisions for which specific tools already exist). The interview appears to be a universal clamp of public HRM, which helps explain its sometimes paradoxical and limited effects with regard to its theoretical functions.The analysis of the uses of appraisal interviews suggests that a distinction should be made between several levels, starting with a national level which remains a strong prescriber of university HRM, through its funding to universities and the rules it produces to organize the local management of agents, most of whom are national civil servants. This is the case, for example, with regard to the appraisal interview system itself: while national government intends to develop the autonomy of universities, it is generalizing a system for the appraisal of staff, embedded in procedures and processes for the management of staff stemming from national rules specific to civil servants' bodies.At the local level, both institutions have few specific HRM policies and practices, including the management of their contractual staff. This observation is the result of both internal political resistance and the complex ways in which decisions are produced within university organizations, where different logics confront each other. In so doing, the development of local management, co-produced with managers and based on the local appreciation of objectives and skills, comes up against the persistence of an historical conception of the public service."
"This thesis studies the advantage to develop the flexibility of managers in the large format retail sector. In this way, a multiple-case study was realized in four hypermarkets belonging to two different groups, in which we met all the 73 operational managers. The analysis of the flexibility of employees indicates a dichotomy between organization-based approaches (flexibility) and person-based (multi-skilled) approaches. We suggest exceeding these two visions thanks to a complex analysis. In these purposes, our methodology opts for plurality and complementarily of sources and data processing. The flexibility of managers develops essentially in the departments of hypermarkets. The types of flexibility vary according to the post (department or section manager) and its degree grows even more as the department is influenced by its environment. Intra-department flexibility consists essentially of an extension of activities in horizontal and vertical which refer to as an impoverishment. Meanwhile, there are some blockings between the departments because of the management system. Finally, all the various profits expected by flexibility can be refuted or partially limited both for managers and the whole organization. We show that current flexibility answers essentially short-term economic orders. So, it turns essentially reactive, partially unknown, inefficient, unpredictable and thus unverifiable. By having these purposes, we recommend the implementation of more qualitative objectives, to imply more middle managers in the decisions, and to consider flexibility in strategic management of HR in the longer term."
"This thesis proposes an empirical test of the leadership attribution model based on the observation of leader-subordinate dyads in Senegal and France. This model focuses on key constructs such as attributional complexity and leader attribution accuracy, resulting behaviors, mediating variables such as subordinate satisfaction, performance corrective strategies, and outcome variables such as leadership perceptions. The model is tested using hierarchical regressions of direct effects and mediating effects of biased allocations. Our intention is to test the relationships from a sample of auditors in continuingeducation of higher education (in Senegal and France) and to determine according to our model and our research hypotheses, which constructs contribute the most to explain the attributional complexity of the leaders. This leads us to study the direct influence of the accuracy of the attributions, the effect of the corrective strategies and the satisfaction of the subordinates on the perception of the leadership. We will also test the role of biased assignments on the two mediating variables. Hypotheses are strongly corroborated. The attributional complexity of leaders is linked to the accuracy of their attributions, as perceived by their subordinates. The performance correction strategies developed by leaders have beenlinked to accurate attribution and then to key outcome variables. We analyze the results as well as the limits and future directions of the research. The managerial contributions are twofold: on the one hand, to take into account in the process of recruiting leaders their ability to adopt a complex attributional approach and, on the other hand, to train them to better support their subordinates."
"It is a known fact that the economic, social and environmental corporate responsibility trends can only be sustainable through the massive involvement of SMEs. This seems even more obvious when faced with the role that these entities play in their economy. Thus, we are interested in how SME managers perceive the concept of CSR and what that translates to in their policies and HR practices. Much research has shed light on the discursive tendencies of CSR and has led us to ask ourselves about the tangible, measurable and engaging nature of so-called socially responsible policies. Therefore, through our exploratory research, we hope to confront reality by choosing a comprehensive qualitative approach based on case studies. Semi-structured interviews, and a two-year period follow -up were carried out among SME managers and allowed the exploration of their various perceptions and associated practices."
"Nowadays, car electronics become more and more complex and represents more than 30% of the total cost of a car. For instance, in a 2008 BMW 5 series model, one can find up to 80 electronic modules communicating together and representing 10 million lines of software code. Facing this growing complexity, carmakers and automotive electronic suppliers are looking for efficient methods to develop, verify and validate electronic modules. In fact, they focus on the software part of these modules since it accounts for more than 80% of the total number of problems detected on these modules. In this context, we achieved our research project with the aim of proposing a global approach able to improve the quality of automotive embedded software. We started with an audit of the software practices currently used in automotive industry and we pinpointed potential levers to improve the global software quality. Based on the results of the audit and the literature review related to software quality, we developed a global approach to improve the design of test cases for software products. In fact, we developed a test generation platform to automatically generate test cases for a software product. It is mainly based on modeling the software functional requirements in order to be simulated when testing the software, focusing on critical tests to be done (because of their higher probability to detect a bug) and monitoring the automatic generation of tests by quality indicators such as the structural and functional coverage but also the tests cost. The generation of critical tests is based on the definition of real use profiles by software product and on the reuse of bugs and test cases capitalized on previous projects. Besides the computational aspects of software testing, our approach takes into account organizational matters such as knowledge management, competency management and project management. Our approach have been implemented in a computer platform and experimented on two typical case studies of an automotive electronic supplier, with historical test data. The results of our experiments reveal significant improvement in software quality: more bugs are detected earlier and in less time."
"The context, in which organisations exist, is changing. They need to cope with four main issues: the belonging to clusters and networks, the focus on knowledge and innovation, the social responsibility and the integration of new behaviours at work. These new issues imply new stakeholders of organisations (such as authorities, society, associations, scientific community or business partners) and diversify their expectations (such as jobs creation, knowledge creation or environmental protection). Thus, the criteria which are necessary to evaluate properly the performance of organisations are multiplying and diversifying. Existing design and management ways must be adapted. This work carries out an action-research within the preclinical imaging platform MIRCen (Molecular Imaging Research Centre) of the CEA, which belongs to the Medicen Paris Region cluster and to other national and international networks. It is based on a values-oriented method, a process approach and a systemic view. It gives rise to the necessity of reconsidering the performance of the organisations which face this new context, through the creation of multiple kinds of values (such as scientific, economic, societal, environmental or ethical), in order to consider the multi-stakeholders and multi-criteria aspects. It proposes an original integrative approach, which enables to model this creation of values and to adopt new ways to design processes and to manage by values, suited to these organisations. It leads to the setting up of an operational management support tool, which enables to carry out these propositions and to meet dynamically a group of stakeholders’ expectations, involving the active implication of all actors of the organisation in its management."
"In this dissertation, we analyze the different aspects of knowledge spillovers with special emphasis on the use of patent citations as an indicator of knowledge flows. The first part of the thesis reviews the traditional knowledge spillovers literature both with a qualitative and a quantitative view (the quantitative form is done through a meta-analysis). A particular focus is placed on the consequences of using the different channels reflecting different weighted functions, i.e. about the underlying assumptions and the implications in terms of estimates. This point is important since these channels are the main source of heterogeneity in the analysis of knowledge spillovers. In the second part, we shed some light on patent and patent citation data that have not been much studied (taken from the Patstat database for the G5 patent offices plus the EPO and the WIPO). Once again this analysis is conducted both in qualitative and quantitative terms. The third part, in a first time, investigates empirically the diffusion pattern of knowledge between and within the G5 inventors for 13 manufacturing sectors. In a second time, it proposes and validates the creation of an input-based indicator of knowledge that takes into account international knowledge spillovers. This indicator can be very helpful since traditional indicators are not always available (such as R&D indicators). Finally, the previously created indicator will be applied in a case study dedicated to analyze the determinants of innovation for energy efficient technologies."
"In the age of outsourcing and globalization, the economic and industrial landscape has seen many radical changes. In such context, supply chains are becoming complex networks of a large number of entities that sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate to fulfill customers’ needs. Standalone supply chains, where each entity makes its decisions so as to maximize its own profits according to its own objectives, often lead to a loss of efficiency and fail to face the complexity of the economic environment they are facing with. Cooperative structures, however, where resources/service facilities are shared and decisions are made to maximize the global profit, prove to be more beneficial and efficient. Consequentially, many companies are fundamentally changing their way of doing business by exceeding the border of standalone and individual actions toward collective actions and cooperative strategies. Therefore, building alliances appears as a successful strategy in modern supply chain networks. In general, cooperation enables a better exploitation of the system’s resources and offers the opportunity to get benefit from large economies of scope, which in turn reduces the total cost/increases the total savings. However, it raises two natural questions that need to be addressed: (1) Which coalitions can be expected to be formed? And, (2) How will the cooperating actors share their total profit? In this Ph.D. dissertation, we tempt to address these questions in retail supply chains where independent retailers coordinate their replenishment from a supplier in order to save on delivery costs. Considering various joint replenishment environments, our principal contribution is to use principles from cooperative game theory to identify the most profitable alliances and to determine the portion of profit that would be allocated to each actor in order to guarantee the stability of the formed alliances."
"This doctoral paper deals with brand hate related by consumers. Presented in this research as involving an overall negative attitude toward a brand, it is composed of several negative emotions, and always generates a behavior. From three exploratory and four quantitative studies, (1) we define the concept in five dimensions; (2) we highlight the negative attitude toward the brand as brand hate and its dimensions antecedent and negative word-of-mouth and the avoidance of the brand as their consequences; (3) we identify the moderator variables of these relationships as the locus of control, psychological reactance, self-esteem and propensity of consumer to resist; and (4) we draw four hate consumers profiles from the dimensions of brand hate and sociodemographic data"
"Emerging Europe Countries (EEC) triggered the greatest simultaneous economic transformation in the economic history 25 years ago.  Although, the idea of market economy prevailed over planned economy building expectation about the speed of convergence process, EEC are still struggling to keep pace with the turbulent global economic environment. This study aims to partially fulfil the gap in economic theory in terms of economic policies reviewing existing theoretical conclusions within economics of transition. The purpose of this overview is simple: we needed to understand every possible limitation inherent in these economies that can distort the effects of economic policies even they showed high effectiveness in developed countries. The 2007/08 financial crises shed light on the existence of important weaknesses that these economises suffer from and challenged the conventional wisdom about unified implementation of market friendly policies over diversified countries. This analysis emphasises all constraints of macroeconomic policies – fiscal and monetary – to be fully deployed in EEC as well as insufficiency of market friendly structural policies to compensate these limitations. Relaying on the theory of economic growth and the theory of economic transition this study is encouraging the idea of the consideration of industrial policies as the missing element of reform strategy of EEC."
"Automotive design is a complex and uncertain process creating a multidimensional value. This process is also characterized by a difficult coordination of the multitude of actors from different areas involved in the design a complex and uncertain product.An analysis of existing control methods in the literature allows us to identify some limits which hamper the simultaneously response to all the characteristics of this process. We propose an innovative control method articulating Value, Opportunities and Risks. Our method contributes to the theoretical works proposing the integration of two major control fields: Performance Management (PM) and Risk Management (RM). Our method allows overcoming the limitations of existing control methods through the adoption of a holistic (taking into account all the dimensions of value), a systemic (taking into account the complex interactions between the various components of this process) and a dynamic approach (by a systematic integration of risks and opportunities to the control of value creation process).To implement this control method in PSA group design process we built a generic prototype. This allowed the mobilization of actors by fixing an improvement trajectory and a dynamic co-conception of an applicable version for PSA.The results of the implementation allowed us to : i) confirm the benefits of our control method articulating Value, Opportunities and Risks which interested several key actors and lead to some effective improvements in vehicle projects management and actors coordination and; ii) reveal difficulties dues to the gap between some of our proposals, seeking to build tools reflecting the design process complexity, and willingness of stakeholders to simplify the method and to focus, in a context of crisis, on the economic dimension and risk management.In our thesis, we also propose some perspectives to improve Management Control function, through the integration of our control method, for a better match with the characteristics of the automotive design process."
"Over the past decade, higher education and research etablishments (HERE) around the world have been confronted with a number of challenges relating to the articulation of three dimensions, namely the development of higher education. Innovation and Sustainable Development. The questions that arise are related to the adoption of new innovative technologies in higher education etablishments, the evaluation of the quality of RSE strategies in a multi-criteria and multi-stakeholder perspective, the development of programs taking into account the challenges of sustainable development, etc.Taking the example of the development strategy of the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines and the creation of the University of Paris Saclay, we will examine how significant initiatives to meet this triple challenge have been developed. A historical reminder will be made to trace the evolution of the strategy of the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (2004-2015) and the University of Paris Saclay (2015-2020) in terms of program development. training and partnerships for sustainable development.In particular, we will use the ePLANETe.blue knowledge mediation portal, which provides (a) an innovative tool for documenting educational programs and materials (TALIESIN DOORWAY), (b) a tool for assessing the quality HERE in a deliberative perspective and (c) an innovative and original approach in the development of pedagogical approaches. A reflective approach is proposed to evaluate the contribution of ePLANETe.blue to the knowledge economy."

"This work contrasts the favoured and sometimes excessive use of figures in organisations with the diminishing sense of responsibility observed in managers in the crisis context following on from the different financial scandals that have occurred in recent years. The literature does not document this link, but it does document each of the terms included in my research problem. I base my definition of the concept of responsibility on that of Ricœur. I define the manager as a person whose decisions orient the organisation, and, based on Fourez' concept of representation, I define figures as any figure, table or grouping of figures. I define favoured use as use that is given priority, whose construction is not questioned. My theoretical research revealed that managers are ill-inclined to question the figures that they use extensively, and that their training hardly encourages them to do so. From my literature review, I identified five variables to explain the link being studied, which I divide into sub-variables; I used these variables to construct my empirical research.In my exploratory fieldwork, I collected primary data from a range of managers with different levels of experience, using semi-structured interviews to encourage narratives. The material I collected is made up of opinions, accounts of personal experiences, anecdotes and so on. I then performed a qualitative discourse analysis, trying to identify as many key topics as possible using, among other tools, NVivo software to perform a content analysis. I used this analysis to code the thirty interviews, by deduction from the insights gained from my theoretical research, but also, and above all, by induction, gaining new insights from the material I had collected into the link under study.My empirical results confirm what I had induced from my review of the literature, but they also reveal four additional insights or variables. They also enabled me to redefine or clarify each of these insights, and to highlight practices and internalised representations that confirm my thesis. They also reveal some signs of change: practitioners showed great interest in my questions, some are beginning to question the predominance of figures, and even the figures themselves. These facts highlight the relevance and solid basis of my research problem."
"In recent years, financial markets worldwide became highly integrated, overcoming national borders. The problem of developing adequate tools and comprehensive approaches for achieving higher security and stability in the EU financial sector is on the agenda. Key issues and challenges for the formation and development of the single European financial market, driven by the new realities, are considered in this thesis. The goal of this thesis is to propose and develop analyses able to contribute to the transformation of the banking system from a structure with delayed-in-time management, in which the impact of the regulatory measures and interventions in response to a particular problem is delayed in the time, into an operational self-regulating system (system of systems) operating in near real-time. This transformation would allow sharp increase in stability and operability of the system. The so defined goal implies the following more specific objectives: to analyze the banking market through the network perspective in order to reveal some aspects of the system, not typical to the particular institutions, regarded as separate entities; to analyze the regulatory and supervisory architectures for discovering the current control structure of the banking system; to explore and develop the architecture of the banking system as a separate critical infrastructure, which could enable the application of network-centric approach as an opportunity for achieving stability and efficiency (operability) in the financial sector, directly related to national and international security. The main proposition of the thesis is the creation of a new type of network supervisory architecture as an alternative to the current supervisory models in order to respond to the modern structure of the financial markets."

"This PhD dissertation deals with the economic representation of consumer behavior with regards to their environmental conscience. The particular focus point is the reproduction of household wastes, which is analyzed from a dual point of view : on the one hand as a consequence of consumption activities, and as a specific economic choice activity on the other. The central problem of this dissertation is thus the following : can the phenomenon ""waste"" be economically represented as an individual consumption act ? The first part of this thesis deals with the environmental sensitivity of consumers in general, and their sensitivity for waste in particular. It is supposed that individuals can integrate the environment in their consumption choices, when buying products on the market : this is defined as continuous environmental rationality. The second part develops the behavior of an individual that decides to separate its waste. On the basis of a qualitative survey among households, their discourse and actions are analyzed in order to define the behavior of a waste consumer-producer (-recycler). One of the results of our survey is the assumption that when economic agents have an environmental conscience, this latter isn't necessarily translated into consumption choices. The conscience for household wastes, which occur only after the consumption moment, defines a discontinuous environmental rationality. On this basis, we suggest to widen the traditionnal anlytical framework of household consumption. "
"This study concerns accounting practices of French enterprises form the cabinet under Colbert until to 1914. It is essentially based on firm archives and technical literature. At the end of the 18th century, certain managers took account of the wear and to tear of fixed assets in their forecasting. Some of them gave an accounting translation. Late 18th-beginning of 19th century, we come upon entries combining depreciation and capital interest. The industrialization and the rise of joint-stock companies favoured the birth of the concept, but the link is not so noticeable as one might think. The practice of depreciation was rare, because fixed assets frequently don't appear in accounts. For many people, they are just a dead stock, the investment is viewed as a consumption. Furthermore, except for the textile industry, which is closely linked to merchant capitalism, entrepreneurs only knew charge and discharge accounting, the traditional model of state finance. Only flows are registered, without organizing the monitoring of fixed assets. Between the 1820s and 1840s, the use of double-entry spread among all industries. Some of the first PLCs were obliged to include depreciation rules in their articles. The setting-up of sinking funds shows us the preoccupation to rebuild the capital init8ially invested. It was at this moment that the accounting mechanism took its French name: ""amortissement"". This word was first used for repayment of loans. Railways companies refrained from depreciating, partly because they used bond issues for investing on a massive scale and because the level of theirs dividends was guaranteed by the state. On the other hand, numerous industrial companies used depreciation as a tool for intensive self-financing. This sometimes generates conflicts between managers and stockholders. Despite some attempts to regulate, practises were not successfully brought into line before tax legislation in 1914. "
"The current thesis concerns the relationship that exists between the experience in acquisitions that a company accumulates and the probability of devestiture of the acquired companies. In order to analyse and validate our research hypotheses, we have constructed our study in five chapters : an analysis of the literature on the approach through resources, the field of organisational learning and divestiture; the presentation of our research methodology; a case study with qualitative interviews regarding the takeover of an english group, Blue Circle by the french cement manufacturer, Lafarge; quantitative study of disinvestments following 140 acquisitions made in the United States in 1994 and finally, a discussion on the results obtained. The results reveal, from a qualitative viewpoint, that an accumulation of experience and an evolution in its organisation and strategy have led the Lafarge groupto modify its integration process. The case studies also revealed the organisational impacts of the integration process and the way in which Lafarge managed its human resource difficulties. For a quantitative viewpoint, we analysed 140 acquisitions made in the United States in 1994 using a longitudinal design. We formulated twelve hypothesis, aiming to determine the relationship between the accumulation of experience (industry, country and total) and the probability of divestiture of the acquired companies. Using a panel logistic regression model, we validate four out twelve hypothesis. We demonstrated a quadratic relationship between post acquisitions experience and the probability of divestiture (U shaped); a quadratic relationship between pre and post industry acquisitions experience and the probability of divestiture (U shaped). Discussion supports the idea that only strong acquierers experience a low probability of divesting previous acquisitions and makes the difference between long term and short terme divestitures."
"The objective of this thesis is to study the modelling of change in regime in the dynamic conditional correlation models. We focus particularly on the Markov-switching approach. Unlike the standard approach based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), we use extensions of HMM coming from probabilistic graphical models theory. This discipline has in fact proposed many derivations of the basic model to model complex structures. Thus, this thesis can be view at the interface of twodisciplines: financial econometrics and probabilistic graphical models.The first essay presents a model constructed from a hierarchical hidden Markov which allows to increase the granularity of the regimes. It can be seen as a special case of RSDC model (Regime Switching for Dynamic Correlations). Based on the hierarchical HMM, our model can capture nuances of regimes that are ignored by the classical Markov-Switching approach.The second contribution proposes a Markov-switching version of the DCC model that is built from the factorial HMM. While the classical Markov-switching approach assumes that all elements of the correlation matrix follow the same switching dynamic, our model allows all elements of the correlation matrix to have their own switching dynamic.In the final contribution, we propose a model DCC constructed based on a decision tree. The objective of this tree is to link the level of volatility with the level of individual correlations. For this, we use a hidden Markov decision tree, which is an extension of HMM."
"In today's increasingly competitive global industrial world, the relationships between enterprises are getting improved towards more cooperation and collaboration. In this context, many companies have recourse to the industrial subcontracting which became a very widespread practice to face competition, but also to cure the technological lack to manufacture a product with a sufficient effectiveness, or the incapacity to product within the deadlines and with the requested quantities. This recourse to subcontracting can be also justified by the will of the company to concentrate on core activities and turn to external sources and collaborate with external partners in order to develop shared technological capabilities. Thus, the importance of subcontracting has increased, creating new challenges for companies. We find in the literature various studies treating subcontracting in aeronautics, manufacturing, construction, business and supply chain..., In this thesis, we study the problems generated by the integration of subcontracting activity in companies providing subcontracting services"
"Some consumption places prove to be very important for the consumer, not because of their intrinsic utility but because they are loved on a long- term basis and contribute to the consumer's self-construction. From an academic perspective, the literature review underscores the dearth of studies on place attachment. Thus, this dissertation intends to address this gap by studying the antecedents of the place attachment in the context of consumption places. A first qualitative exploratory study enabled us to unpack the mechanisms driving attachment to a consumption place. Then, we developed and validated a measurement scale including 11 items and 3 dimensions (social, physical, and personal). Eventually, an on-line questionnaire administered to 517 internet users enabled us to test the mechanisms suggested by the literature and the qualitative exploratory study. Results show that the attachment to a place is driven by numerous variables (specifically by the authenticity and psychological comfort felt in the place) which influence the construct dimensions with different degrees of intensity. They also suggest that the attachment to a place leads to behaviors and attitudes expressing loyalty, commitment, idealization, or decision to become the ambassador of the place. All these reactions might be of great interest to the managers willing to improve the relationships with their customers. To conclude, it is worth noting that the antecedents to attachment are also dependent on the nature of the consumption place. "
"Most economic studies that have been done on Palestine are committed, whether explicitly or not, to overcome the ubiquity of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. Indeed, this is in line with standard economic thinking which places the market at the center of its interests, and overlooks “facts of power” in social relations. Yet, at the same time, they manage to show that politics is an obstacle to the flow of the economy, and therefore, express their wish that the latter becomes an alternative to the former. These works are dominant; they contribute to policy-making and guide the spending of international financial aid to Palestinians.By contrast, I consider the pauperization of Palestinian society a result of the colonial policy of dispossession. The consequences of this policy are manifest in the economic dependency of Palestinians, hence the loss of political autonomy. Indeed, since the British Mandate of Palestine, Zionist colonization of the country came at the expense of the Palestinian Arab presence. In Israel, after 1948, and in the newly occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, after 67, this process of dispossession went hand in hand with an economic integration that has continued until this day.In parallel, the peace process that had begun in Oslo in 1993 contributed to the modeling of a subjugated area integrated into neoliberal globalization under US hegemony. Thus, the transfer of funds established by international financial aid, the exhortation made by the international community to the Palestinians to participate in the economic growth and development, as well as the integration of the Palestinian economy in the Israeli economy and in globalization, should be considered highly political strategies to eliminate ostensibly relations of power, and therefore, invite Palestinians to accept their subjugation. In that sense, economics as well as politics, appear to be “war by other means”."
"This research focusing on micro finance covers the Middle Guinea area or Fouta Djalon, one of the four natural regions of Guinea. The main objective is to review how micro finance helps to articulate formal finance (banks) and informal finance (tontines, village banks, etc.) in order to provide sustainable financial services in rural areas and to examine the effect on the fight against poverty. At both regional (West Africa) and national levels (Guinea), we noted that the various financial sectors operate in a relatively flexible partitioned context. The micro finance sector, the latest financial sector, is now a strong alternative in the collection of savings and financing of local activities through innovative mechanisms established mainly on the basis of the proximity to local populations. However, we have shown how two visions of micro finance are continuing to compete: the social one, based on the goodwill of donors, so heavily dependent on donors; and the other, commercial, institutional one, based on the willingness to build a real functional autonomy of the MFI technically, financially and in human terms. In addition, we have shown how the debate on the relationship between micro finance and poverty is not yet settled, as the impact on the field is challenging for researchers and funders regarding the effectiveness of micro finance as a tool for effective poverty reduction. The question remains how micro finance can be an element of de-partitioning through an articulation between formal finance and informal finance. To answer this question, we identified two arguments which are the two parts of the thesis. The first part outlines the diversity of modes of financing in West Africa, articulating the link between micro finance and poverty, repeating the theoretical debates that continue to clash on this issue, and presents the challenge in articulating financial services as a solution for breaking down barriers and improving the provision of such services. The second part shows empirical examples of nexus between banking, micro finance and informal finance through the practices of users, but states some concerns about the future of this activity in the region."
"Management innovation is a specific genre within the literature on innovation. We will focus on a critical phase on managerial innovations lifecycle, sprawling between invention and diffusion. We aim at understanding the processes at work between the moment an innovation is invented within an organization and the moment it is considered established and validated by numerous organizations. Relying on a case study and a participative observation approach, we will put forward an exploratory analysis of this phase allowing to highlight its characteristics in various lights: evolution of content and rhetoric, evolution dynamics and design system"
"The aim of this thesis is to introduce the sports betting market, and more precisely to show how this market forms a simplified framework for observations, close enough to stock markets to test the informational efficiency theory, and lead to unanimous conclusions about its empirical validity. Firstly, we focus on the weak form of informational efficiency and more particularly on an anomaly known as the Favourite Longshot Bias, which was listed in sports betting markets, as well as in stock markets. Thanks to a vast data sample, we prove that transaction costs and bettors’ preferences have a significant impact on odds fixed by bookmakers, and consequently on prices’ structure. Moreover, we also discuss bettors’ rationality and we show how bettors’ behaviour is not so different from that of investors in the stock markets. Secondly, we provide a detailed analysis of the strong form of informational efficiency and more precisely of the spread as an indicator of insider trading in the sports betting market."
"The aim of our work is to study the Business Model (BM) of small and micro business (SMB) in West Africa. Our research is based on a conventionalist and institutionalist approach of the concept of BM. BM and the convention are our conceptual and theoretical initial choice, while the institutionalist approach has been introduced through the emerging topics during our research. We called our conventionalist conceptualization of BM ""modèle 3C"" of tree convention: value convention, financing convention and operating convention. The central hypothesis of our study suggests that these three conventions link the funding source to theSMB. So the role of funding source is relevant to study the SMB BM. The operationalization of the analytical framework of the 3C model, through a mixed methodology and abductive research has produced results in three areas: 1) understanding of the conventions of SMB BM requires a return to the preconditions; 2) there is a plurality of conventions of BM based of SMB, according to the leader of the SMB and funding sources; 3) BM conventions are not only a function of the source of funding and SMB; institutional context play an important role. A critical view of the key concepts of our research based on our findings has opened new avenues of study."
"The automotive industry is increasingly dependent on plastic materials whose price level and volatility have risen sharply over the past decade due to the assumed effect of fluctuations in crude oil prices, which is the key feedstock in the production of final products such as plastics. This thesis aims to provide econometric tools to analyze, understand, and manage the risk of price volatility of major plastics materials consumed in the automotive industry. Using the cointegration methodology, we show that long-term equilibrium relationship and short-term dynamics reveal the transmission mechanism of input prices changes from the upstream market to the prices of plastics materials on the downstream market. The significant cointegration relationships between petrochemical and crude oil prices justify the development of hedging strategies against inputs prices fluctuation and the estimation of error correction models that should produce better prices forecast."
"Despite the fact that real estate is the largest asset class in our economy, it is one of the few that do not have a mature derivatives market. Recent academic studies have shown that the lack of understanding of real estate derivatives’ prices is the main reason for the absence of a market. This dissertation aims to change this. By conducting theoretical and empirical studies we describe their statistical characteristics, their risk factors, and we highlight their importance in terms of price discovery function. Property derivatives are an essential tool for risk management, but they also offer for investors and regulators a source of information that would otherwise not be available"
"AImplementing an integrated system, such as an ERP, is not without consequences. However, only a few studies have looked at post-implementation. The focal point of our research is the capacity of the ERP to evolve after being implemented, when confronted to changes of needs of the organization and its ecosystem, in particular concerning logistical dimensions. Indeed, logistics is often at the origins of major reconfigurations – risks that need to be integrated by an ERP system, whose rigidities have been abundantly addressed in publications. It is thus interesting to examine different mechanisms that would enable to have the ERP evolve, in order to keep it consistent with the needs, the strategy and the performance of the company. This question is at the heart of this thesis on the contribution of the management of logistics risks on the one hand, to underline the ERP misfits (Strong et Volkoff, 2010) and, on the other hand, to their evolution and adaptation (Besson et Rowe, 2011). Our methodology is essentially qualitative and relies mainly on a case study, with three phases of non-participant observations made in an aeronautics company whose ERP system is stable. Our observations, documentation and interviews show the software package is an asset for logistics robustness in the short term and, at the same time, a disadvantage in front of logistics risks, which will be either accepted without the ERP evolving, reduced with the evolution of the ERP or avoided with the actual bypassing of the ERP. In all cases, the management of logistics risk appears as a tool enabling the continuous evolution of the ERP configuration and so improving its alignment and performance."
"This thesis analyses the relationship between strategy and management control systems. Its aim is to refine Simons’ four levers of control framework in studying the interactions between top and middle managers around management control tools in order to form and implement the strategy of the organization. Using the actor-network theory (ANT) in a case study, this thesis reveals a double process of translation. On the one hand, top managers design management control systems in order to interest their subordinates to the global intended strategy. On the other hand, middle managers use the same control systems to translate their own local strategic intentions. This double translation process is made possible by two different uses of the interactive lever of control, based on face to face discussions. The first one is non invasive, inspirational and allows strategy emergence, the second one is invasive and allows top managers to implement the intended strategy in involving themselves in the decisions of their subordinates. The evidence of two different uses open ways of research on the relationship between management control systems and strategy or management control and innovation"
"Our thesis focuses on SMB bank financing in France. This Kind of firms tends to borrow from more than one bank to finance their investments in recent years. The choice of multiple bank relationships by SMB leads us to formulate two questions i) What are the determinants of the choice of number of banks by firms? ii) How the financial and non financial conditions of credit contract are they affected by the choice of the number of banks of SMB? To answer the theoretical assumptions formulated on these issues, we perform econometric tests on a sample of 144 French SMB. The data concern the year 2009 and come from a survey. These data are unique, recent, are not available in any database and completed by accounting data. The results of the econometric study show that the number of banks is even higher than the degree of informational opacity of the firm is low. Econometric tests also show that there is a positive and significant relationship between the number of the banks and the risque of exposure to credit rationing. Firm’s quality seems to be an important determinant of the number of banks and the conditions of credit contract, but its effect remains ambiguous"
"In this PhD dissertation, we investigated the way of exploiting the demand forecasts for the upstream flow management in a context of mass production of highly diverse products and of geographical dispersion of the production units. When the forecasts are poorly exploited, phenomena similar to the well-known bullwhip effect in the downstream supply chain appear in the upstream supply chain altering permanently its performances. In order to counter some of the mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we proposed an adaptation of the MRP to perform the exploitation of the forecasted demand. The adaptation of the MRP is based on a calculation method that uses the planning BOM for calculating and transmitting replenishment levels along the upstream supply chain. This approach has been successfully tested on several application studies in the automotive industry"
"This thesis studies the integration of environmental entities for their own sakes (EEOS) in external corporate accounting. We firstly place our question (Q) in the framework of Human – Nature relationships, through an analysis of Modernity. This leads us to define 3 generic approaches of Q: a Modern Orthodox one, focused on objectification and which includes in particular the existence value; a Modern one which refers to Environmental Ethics, where non-human entities are subjectified through the intrinsic value; an a-Modern Relational Ecological one. Then we prove that the fundamental narrative of financial accounting is the one of the maintenance of a capital – Fundist, Materialist or monetary. Thus we redefine the notion of capital in an extended way and we elaborate an Integrative Accounting Model (IAM), which systematises the expansion of financial statements to every capital from the capital maintenance principle. We finally connect the integration of EEOS, according to the different generic approaches, to the maintenance of some capitals and we apply the IAM to these capitals in order to obtain accounting models which respond to Q in a systematic way."
"The PhD thesis is a contribution to the definition of a new banking risk related to the economic impacts of climate change. The climate change will impact the clients of a corporate and investment bank and will have consequences on its strategy and the composition of its business portfolio. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain on the economic impacts of climate change and create a new risk for the banks: the carbon risk. The quantification of “GreenHouse Gases (GHG) emissions induced” by the businesses of the bank’s clients is a first step required for managing this new risk. After having studied the various models of carbon accounting, this PhD thesis proposes an analysis tool based on a new form of carbon accounting by allocating the GHG emissions to the economic agents in accordance with their ability to reduce it: “the accounting by issue”. This tool allows mapping sectorally and geographically of the “GHG emissions induced” by a financing and investment portfolio (in debt and equity capital)."
"This thesis is composed of four essays. The first two essays draw on behavioral corporate finance and show to what extent French firms can take advantage of investors’ erroneous judgment. We first study the impact of the familiarity bias on ownership. We find that firms with higher notoriety level, mostly small-cap ones, have higher individual ownership. Second, we test the catering hypothesis in dividend policy, in that whether firms are more prone to pay dividend when payers trade at a premium relative to non-payers. The results validate this hypothesis and support short-term opportunistic behavior by French firms, especially when family control is low or institutional ownership is high. The last two essays examine the impact of climate change issues on firms’ decisions, in an international setting. Especially, the third essay demonstrates that eco-efficiency-based strategies significantly matters to the financial outcomes of mergers and acquisitions, which supports the economic rationality underlying carbon reduction investments, and claims for a win-win relationship between corporations and their environment. The fourth essay that deals with the environmental voluntary disclosure, emphasizes the increasing interest of stakeholders toward this kind of information: firms with higher exposure, higher leverage and those that are in the scope of regulators tend to be more transparent in terms of carbon reporting. Moreover, firms that are less eco-efficient show higher probability to report on their environmental performance, suggesting the search for legitimacy."
"The quality of manager's control is likely to reduce financial controversies. An analysis based on both contract theories, organization theories, and theories of stakeholders allows us to identify three channels through which the efficiency of the control can be highlighted that is, expertise, independence and appointment process. The analytical approach is based on a case study and a survey of Cameroon firms. The results show that there are failures in control mechanism and that the organizational behavior of firms has no influence on their performances. This thesis has identified the causes of these failures and suggests some practical recommendations necessary to renew the theoretical foundations for corporate governance."
"This thesis reports a study of accountants’ everyday work. Direct observation of their daily work through participant observation allows showing erratic terms understudied by accounting research. Contributions are drawn upon financial accounting and organizing as well. I propose a preliminary conceptual formalization of the preparation of accounts in organizations, combining actors, tools and contexts. By giving enough importance to preparers in the study of financial reporting, our contributions question dominant representations in financial accounting research. Our results describe how some of the qualities commonly attributed to financial statements (neutrality, loyalty ...) are of questionable importance and how reducing financial reporting to an agency conflict is difficult."

"In relations with the rising concerns on sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), sustainability-related topics have become a key trend in the real estate sector. This dissertation examines sustainable real estate, and investigates more particularly the value it holds for various stakeholders. Each of the five chapters focuses on different market players to analyse how sustainability-related topics are perceived, and the extent to which these perceptions shape practices. Chapter 1 questions the notion of value associated with sustainability-related features at a building level. Chapter 2 examines the value creation strategies associated with sustainability-related topics at corporate level. Chapters 3 and 4 focus respectively on the diffusion of sustainability certification schemes, and occupiers’ perceptions of their brand value. Chapter 5 explores the impacts of sustainability-related trends on the long term management of the building stock."
"The quality of primary education in Côte d'Ivoire has deteriorated sharply over the past three decades. This situation is the result of an approximate management of the education system, which is characterized by a lack of educational support, a misallocation of resources, a congestion of classrooms (42 students for a teacher in primary school) and a lack of skilled and well trained teachers. In addition, the military-political conflict in September 2002 did not allow to improve this situation; on the contrary, it has further deteriorated the situation. Thus, the aim of this thesis is first to analyze the influence of resource endowments on the effectiveness of primary schools in Cote d'Ivoire on the basis of a survey on the competence conducted by the Ministry of Education. Secondly, it examines the impact of military-political conflict in September 2002 on the demand for education based on data from the MICS-2000 and 2006 household surveys. To do this, a classification of schools according to their resource endowment was made, then, using the method of data envelopment analysis (DEA nonparametric method), an efficiency frontier is constructed to highlight the specificities of schools and finally an econometric estimation (Tobit model censored data) is implemented to identify factors influencing the formation of effectiveness scores. The analysis shows that increasing the amount of resources allocated to a school does not guarantee its performance as the efficiency factors are not resident in endowment quantity, but rather in the endowment quality, that is the values and characteristics intrinsic to people and materials available to schools, this fact in order to fit the specific needs of schools and fairness. Furthermore, using a methodology combining both double differences estimation, the triple differences estimation and correction by the robustness checks, we find that the rate of access and completed grades of primary school s one to six of primary school declined because of the crisis. Indeed, the proportions of children completing levels 1 and 2 have fallen by 25% and those of children completing levels 3, 4 and 5 have decreased by 22%, 16% and 4% respectively."
"In the context of changes of general practice (uneven distribution of young general practitioners (GPs) across the country, strong feminisation), this thesis focuses on the determinants of the outpatient care supply of general practitioners. Using different micro-econometric analyses, firstly we want to understand the impact of feminization on the incomes of general practitioners and specifically on their private practice behaviours in terms of volume of care provided but also composition of the activity (consultations, home visits). Secondly, we study the determinants of the practice location choice within the region and we identify the levers that could improve the distribution of GPs in the area. Our results confirm that female GPs provide fewer services than male GPs and they also have a different composition of private practice activity. However, we show that male and female GPs adopt a similar practice location choice. Factors characterizing the place of installation as the characteristics associated with the supply of care, the demand for care, or equipment influence the practice location choice."
"In the early 1990s, like in many other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Senegal was also facing a decrease in the gross school enrolment ratio (GER). Despite the numerous measures taken for increasing GER at lower cost (creation of double shift classes, strengthening of multi-grade classes, creation of training schools which train teachers curriculum in one year instead of four as previously, increased recruitment of assistant teachers, etc.), this decline continued until 1994. In order to reverse this downward trend, the government recruited non-civil servant teachers (education volunteers and contract teachers). Compared to their tenured colleagues, these ""new teachers"" received a short duration professional training and employed under less favorable conditions (without tenure and other social advantages). Moreover, the wages they earn are considerably lower than those in the public services. These conditions lead to low motivation and significant deficiencies of skills, and consequently imply a negative impact on the quality of education. After relocating the current issues of Senegalese school, in this thesis we evaluate the impact of the contractual teachers‟ recruitment policy on the quality of primary education by using data from PASEC surveys that was conducted in school year 2006/2007 and by applying the quasi-experimental impact method. In this study, the empirical difficulty of evaluating the impact lies in estimating the counterfactual. Indeed, it is not possible to observe each student of a class taught by “non-civil servant teachers” in a situation where the student was a member a class ruled by a civil servant teacher. To avoid this difficulty, we use the matched observational techniques proposed by Rubin (1974). Our results show in the second grade, civil servants are more effective than contract teachers in transmitting knowledge to students. On the other hand for the fifth grade, contract teachers are more efficient for pupil‟s results. The performance of volunteer teachers is not significantly different from the civil servant teachers at both educational levels."
"A growing number of academic studies and international organizations reports have noticed an increasing dependency of new energy technologies on a specific class of natural resources often called minor metals. For several years, worries about economic availability of these metals in order to realize the energy transition have appeared. This thesis aims at underline the broader risks and constraints involved by general use of these metals in new energy technologies. A first part of this thesis is devoted to theories and indicators related to the depletion of non renewable resources. This part also shows that minor metals share many characteristics and that they can form a group of metal consistent. In a second part, this thesis addresses the issues linked to the absence of price elasticity for the supply of minor metals due to the byproduct constraint. Another chapter offers an analysis of causes and consequences connected to the absence of futures markets for almost all minor metals. Finally, a last chapter highlights the strong link existing between the energy sector and the metals sectors. This connection is increasing and can create a vicious circle between energies which are less and less concentrated and metals which consume more and more energy due to their depletion."
"Difficulties in people’s mobility and in the flow of goods are one of the major obstacles to better the living conditions of populations in less-developed countries generally speaking, and particularly in Africa. That is true indeed for the Republic of Niger. As far as foreign trade is concerned, one can easily notice the constraints linked to the geographical location of the country, just by looking at the map of Africa. Not only its striking external isolation, but also its land-locked situation focuses a serious development issue. The size of this land-locked state and its economic weakness are the basic context for transportation in Niger. The department of Téra, which represents Niger well, allows understanding malfunctions in the transportation system and how mobility is part of the local development process. The low level of the services of transportation, the ageing infrastructures and the difficult access to means of transport are recurring problems for populations. The different stakeholders’ strategies have had limited impact on the improvement of mobility within the department. Those important malfunctions concerning people’s mobility and the flow of goods must be solved."
"Policy analysis in Africa has mainly focused on their evaluation. Now that several reforms are undertaken and that the progressive move toward democracy allows new actors to enter the political arena, it is useful to analyze how decisions on public issues are made. The dissertation examines the reform of the teacher recruitment policy in francophone Africa. The reform consisted in changing the teacher status in order to allow the government to pay a lower salary to new teachers. The drawbacks of the usual policy and research from the area of economics of education demonstrating that the reform was necessary put the issue on the agenda. If many countries adopted it, some have not. Factors that triggered the reforms vary among countries: the severity of the lack of teachers, the existence of a high number of teachers paid by the communities, and mainly pressure from donors through external aid. In some countries, the civil society was more involved in the policy process. However, this involvement did not block the reform; neither did it prevent the reform from diverting significantly from the usual policy."
"Some States host Open Registers (also known under the pejorative term of “flags of convenience”): ships are registered regardless of their actual owners’ nationality or residence, and thus States enable them to escape from their country of origin’s legal framework. By being an aspect of globalization, this phenomenon has been growing up for 30 years, and is nowadays widespread, or even universal. Because each State fixes the conditions for implementation of its right to register ships, the phenomenon is a legal one. But it has strong economic implications too. Indeed, the laws of the State of registration – namely “flag state” – determine certain costs or some advantages for the company that adopts it, and can be attractive or repellent as for them.This work proposes an economic reading of the open registers of ships as a recent object of economics and tries to highlight the contribution of this activity to small islands’ economies, especially through some Caribbean examples (the Caribbean is by the way the historical cradle of this activity and offshore financial centres).Based on data concerning the last 30 years and 7 open-registry countries of the Caribbean (Gross Domestic Products and some items of the balances of payments), the research conducted here shows that, except perhaps Antigua, no significant correlation exists in host countries between the fleets registered and the economic gains : the “open registration” is not, by itself, a gain for small island economies surveyed."
"In this thesis, we focus on supply chain where the actors are independent entities. More precisely, ours interests are on point-to-point (customer/supplier) relationships where the actors (the customer and the supplier) are independent entities which want to set up collaborative planning process under uncertainty, such that the customer produces to orders and the supplier produces to stock. In this context, the major contribution of the thesis is the integration of ill-known data (date of requirement, required quantities ...etc.) to calculate a robust procurement plan (plan which minimize the impact of uncertainty). We used the possibility theory to model those uncertainties. After the model of ill-known data proposed, we present a set of methods to compute a procurement plan using the additional information (information on the uncertainty)."
"In this thesis, we study the economic consequences, in terms of instability, of the mandatory IAS/IFRS adoption in the banking industry. The thesis is organized as follows. In a first part (Chapter I), we develop a theoretical framework whose purpose is to understand the mechanisms through which the mandatory IAS/IFRS adoption by banks may influence the probability of occurrence of a banking crisis. At this stage, we show that several arguments, derived from the contractual and informational perspectives of accounting, can be mobilized in order to justify the hypothesis that the mandatory IAS/IFRS adoption has a positive or a negative influence on banking stability. The second part of the thesis (Chapters II, III, IV) propose three empirical studies, based on samples of European banks, related to some of the issues discussed in the first part. The results of these studies indicate that: (1) banks have improved capital adequacy following the IAS/IFRS adoption, due to a better market discipline in an IFRS environment; (2) banks constrained in liquidity (and only these banks) have increased their credit supply following the IAS/IFRS adoption, due to an easier access to external resources in an IFRS environment; (3) fair value accounting does not contribute to degrade the explanatory power of a default risk model based on accounting variables. These results, consistent with a positive influence of the IAS/IFRS adoption on bank stability, tend to moderate the criticisms expressed against IFRS accounting standards, in the background of the recent global banking crisis."
"The main objective of this thesis is to evaluate the social cost of respiratory cancer attributable to occupational risk factors in France. A summary of the available epidemiological data in the literature is performed. By using the Medline database, a review of the literature restricted to meta-analysis highlights the relative risk data available. The method of Attributable Risks (AR) is mobilized to estimate the numbers of lung, sinonasal and mesothelioma cancer cases caused by asbestos, exhaust fumes from diesel engines, painters, crystalline silica, wood dust and leather dust. We then assess the costs of these cancer cases for the french society using the Cost Of Illness (COI) method. To take into account all indirect costs we develop a decision tree to estimate the probability of being involved in each cost category. We set up cancer-specific assessment models for each category of costs that allow us to estimate, according to incidence-based and prevalence-based approaches, direct costs (hospital and ambulatory care), indirect costs of morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality in the market and nonmarket spheres. For 2010, the social cost of lung, sinonasal and mesothelioma cancer cases caused by asbestos, exhaust fumes from diesel engines, painters, crystalline silica, dust wood and leather dust in France is estimated between 986 and 1 248 million euros according to prevalence-based approach and between 1 223 and 1 586 million euros according to incidence-based approach among which 760 to 806 million euros only for asbestos."
"This doctoral thesis examines Robert’s (1991) conceptualization of accountability in conflicting situations. In organizational contexts, individuals give account in two ways; at a distance, to show that their actions are aligned with the main goals of the company – hierarchical accountability -; in face-to-face situations, to provide explanations to people they meet - social accountability. First I study how accountability takes shape when an individual faces two antagonist demands for accountabilities towards the same act. Interviews were conducted with employees from CSR departments, whose mission is about providing an answer to social demands in the name of the company, while staying aligned with business principles. With the help of Foucaldian concepts of “Ethics” and “Moral” (1991), I show that employees interpret those two demands within their own norms and provide an answer that satisfies themselves first. This specific answer is rejected. Accountability is interrupted. In order to re-establish accountability, a community is created around that specific answer, gathering employees from various companies. This community provides a space to give accounts and confirms CSR managers are acting appropriately.Second, analysing ethnographic material, I try to understand how accountability takes shape when certain employees oppose the mission of their colleagues. Precisely, the discussion takes place regarding a product, which has been developed especially for poor rural populations, who are assimilated into the “underdeveloped world” and with which the Malian elite would not be associated. First, with the help of Saïd (1978) and Fanon’s (1952) work, I explain the reason for that class conflict through the dichotomy between “North and South”. This dichotomy has been translated south to “local elite / rural population”. Second, I show that to overcome difficulties, employees develop alternative forms of accountabilities toward villagers and toward themselves. The second form aims to develop mutual support but also reinstate accountability toward hierarchy by using their personal positions and degree of power in order to take a coordination action.Overall, this doctoral thesis shows that hierarchical accountability can be momentarily interrupted and later can be restored by the development of alternative types of social accountability."
"The cocoa crisis of the late 1970s greatly affected the survival strategies of producers. It manifests in the scarcity of production (land, labour), the decrease in production and revenue, the transformation of the ecological milieu and the decrease in rainfall. In order to overcome these constraints, producers have adopted various strategies that either aim at diversifying their sources of revenue or reduce family responsibilities. The main result of this study is the observation that, the most efficient of these strategies were those shaped while taking into consideration social relationships. They include strategies to diversify revenue, credit, mobilisation of the labour factor, the respect of guidance rules. The diversification of revenue which was based on solidarity and cooperation constitute an important element of the producers’ survival strategies because they have ensured an ineligible first degree security in cocoa crisis."
"The non-timber forests Products (NTFP) are part of natural resources of which the Congolese population has recourse to diversify its productive activities and to improve its income. These products are essential part of various menus; they guarantee the diversity, the quality, and the access to foods to a greater majority of the population. The lack of systematic information enabling to evaluate the contribution of NTFP to the income of households and to the improvement of food security, the lack of official programs of management and the promotion of these products constitute one of the obstacles to the prosperity of the NTFP sector and the improvement of the living standard of the people.The present work is aimed at analyzing in a global way and for the first time in the Republic of the Congo, the contribution of NTFP to food security. It covers the aspects related to the definitions of NTFP, to their classification in NTFP of vegetable origin and NTFP of animal origin, to the institutional context; it identifies the main stakeholders mainly the group of socio- economic actors involved in the exploitation and management of NTFP at the local level, the modes of exploitation and their impacts on the natural environment; the fields of commercialization enabling to fully understand the export products have been alternatively analyzed . A great important part of the study is devoted to the contribution analysis of the NTFP to the food diet of the Congolese people. This work highlights the main difficulties and obstacles of the social, institutional, commercial order and management which hinder the normal development of the NTFP sector."
"This research examines the importance of technological factors in international tourism specialisation. The test application consists in finding tourism data related to technology, as well as in synthesising the correlation between tourism and technological factors which appear in domestic tourism expenditures, visitor exports, tourism investment, and expenditures on research and development (R&D) in order to compare their proportions between 2000 and 2010 and analysed the information by country group classification (Advanced countries, Developing countries, and Least Developed countries). The results show that tourism investment and R&D are significant factors in enhancing the tourism receipts of a country. This interpretation relates more precisely to Vernon's “Product Life Cycle” theory which has proven to be a highly demonstrative tool as to the advantages of level technology in terms of added value in product quality and product development. The theory of Demand of Linder is also concerned in order to enhance each other between domestic and international tourism specialisation. It was found that most countries in the advanced group display a solid technological sector and an innovating economy as well as the data on R&D expenditures are mainly allocated in advanced country groups; this fact also influences the quality of tourism development in the long term. In developing countries, the domestic expenditures have shown stronger than visitor exports in countries with large population. The high population in the country reflects the size of its domestic market. In contrast, the proportion of visitor export is higher than domestic expenditures in the tourism destination countries; these country groups attract international tourists. The potential of expenditures by local populations in LDC countries is also weak, it obviously affects to the ratio of both domestic and international expenditures. The theories of Heckscher&Ohlin, Comparative advantage, and/or Absolute Advantage can be considered for LDC countries, they should take advantage of being tourist destination countries by applying the technology concerned to maintain the destination. Not only would this allocate physical capital but it would also enable them to invest in human resources (education, training, knowhow, and knowledge)."
"This thesis is a collection of theoretical essays in the area of horizontal M&As and R&D with spillovers. As we know, organizations consider horizontal M&As as the external mode of expansion, and regard R&D as one of the most efficient internal expansion modes, to achieve and maintain sustainable growth. This thesis pursues the firm growth’s tactic to trace the impact of two aforementioned expansion modes on firm’s performance and profitability. The dissertation is divided into two parts, which respectively focus on the following issues:Part I: (competitive effects of external growth strategies)Horizontal M&As generate cost variation via uncertainty (Chapter 1) or via technological transfer (Chapter 2). We aim to study different types of horizontal M&A and find out which one is the most profitable from the national perspective, and to verify whether the M&A entry option is more efficient compared to others, such as Greenfield FDI and exporting, from the international perspective.Part II: (competitive effects of internal growth strategies)R&D effort contributes to cost reduction (Chapter 3) or to quality enhancement (Chapter 4), and it can be beneficial to other firms at no cost due to spillover effect. By considering the long-run R&D decision and the short-run price (or quantity) decision, we attempt to distinguish between full and partial regimes in terms of collusion (Ch.3) or delegation (Ch.4), and to illustrate whether firms have incentive to adopt partial regime."
"Geostatistics and spatial econometrics are two spatial statistical approaches used to deal with spatial dependence. Geostatistics estimates directly the variance-covariance matrix by assuming that the covariance among observations depends inversely on the distance between their locations, called the covariogram. Spatial econometrics defines and integrates the spatial interaction matrix in a hedonic regression model. In real estate, price estimation should take into account these spatial characteristics because property prices are correlated. Hence, these two approaches are commonly used to study the spatial dependence of the real estate prices in many contexts. However, a definite rule in selection these statistic approaches has not been established. This thesis examined these two approaches in order to distinguish the similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages of each methodology. Some examples of their applications in a real estate study. The geostatistics is used to analyze the stationarity of the variogram and its sensitivity depending on the parameters added in hedonic estimation. The spatial econometric is used to define econometrically the real estate market dominant area"
"Our thesis has to point of departure a situation of empirical management represented by a circle of foresight thinking, which we call FPS (Foresight Participatory Strategic), conducted by BASF Agro over a period of more than ten years with all the actors involved in the food chain. The players in the circle have a merchant relationship and decide to explore opportunities for collaboration on a community way. They expanded together a design space or interact the knowledge and relationships in a process of innovation. We have ended up with the assumption that the FPS plays the role of an open-strategizing platform and for the operation of business between the actors which is used to reflect and devise all the new strategies. The FPS is a management innovation which the configuration of implicit reference is a business ecosystem, and not just a typical organization. Our analysis is based on a longitudinal case study of seventeen years"
"This thesis seeks to verify, from French data, the Oswald hypothesis, according to which homeownership would be a hindrance to labor market’s flexibility and thus result in a higher unemployment rate. The first chapter presents a synthesis of recent literature seeking to verify this hypothesis. The second chapter analyzes the effect of residential status on rates return-to-employment. Empirical findings show that owners have more likely to access local jobs, but less likely to access jobs involving residential mobility. The second chapter investigates the effect of housing tenure status on unemployment duration. Empirical findings indicate that constrained owners leave faster unemployment, while owners holding a large stock of financial assets remain longer unemployed. Finally, the fourth chapter proposes a model with heterogeneous agents to analyze the effects of residential status and public policies on rates return-to-employment. Our results show that the cost of mobility affects the geographical mobility and the lowest exit rate of unemployment to owners is mainly due to the strategy of homeownership and a wealth effect."
"This thesis focuses on two phenomena: human capital and skilled migration.Such a choice is consolidated by the observation that on the one hand, humancapital is for Lebanon the only raw material given that it has no other resourcesof any kind that can promote its development, and on the other hand theinevitability of migration in the absence of opportunities.This thesis consists of three parts. In the first one, we extract from the abundantliterature the main features related to human capital, such as its contribution tothe growth of long-term capital and long-term production and therefore thegrowth of the considered country. Then, we study in detail the motivations ofbrain drain and its impact on source countries (underdeveloped) and hostcountries (developed).The second part is intended to describe in the Lebanese economy, factors ofgeneration of human capital, skilled employment levels, and skilled workersemigration.The third part is devoted to a model that combines these two phenomena inorder to highlight their interaction. This model is part of the work dealing withbrain drain using an overlapping generation economy in which are representedthe choices of consumers and producers. This model emphasizes the divergenceof interest towards skilled migrants, between source of emigration and hostcountries.This model has the merit of linking microeconomic effects characterized by anindividual choice of training to become skilled and of migrating, to themacroeconomic consequences of migratory movements, through an analysis ofagents' income and their employment level, long-term capital stock, long-termproduction, and welfare.Resolving the model gives the optimal quantity of this selective migration. Thisquantity is made explicit for source and host countries in a long-term perspectivefollowing pure and perfect competition situation and unionization of skilledworkers.The numerical results clearly confirm the following observation: the hostcountry clearly benefits from these skilled immigrants while the source countryis subject to the drain of one of its most production factors. These results alsoallow us to make for both countries a comparison of wages, employment levels,individual and collective welfare, capital and product.Comparisons of different numerical values suggest a means of action by thepolicymaker in the source country to mitigate the negative effects of the braindrain. This method can be achieved, on the one hand, through policiesfavourable to the qualified organization within a pressure group, and on theother hand, by directing skilled emigration to countries whose economy is mostliberal."
"The study is about the valorisation of food products from the mountain areas. The mountains are represented often as a savage nature. However, under the economic plan, the mountains are considered as less favoured areas. The main mountain areas has still a strong agrarian character, therefore the add value of their food offer could consist in alternative to improve the income of the mountain farmers and food enterprises. The highlighting of some characteristics which can to differentiate their food products in the market could to help the improvement of this economic segment of the mountain areas. The background of our study is a contemporary theme, the rural development, a topic on which management science are still not mobilized, then we estimated that they could contribute significantly. So we resorted to major authors in the field of management science such as Simon, Lancaster, Chandler and Porter. We also looked for concepts and author in the economic field trying to establish a dialogue to our research problem and doing a managerial reading of proposed concepts. We conduct our research on two axes. The first concerns the perceptions and expectations of consumers towards the supply of mountain food products. The second focus is on the food enterprises based in mountains, their structures, marketing strategies and their relationship with the territory of implantation. First we studied the farmer enterprises located in Lozère, France, and supported by the European Programme Leader. On the other hand, we have also studied the business of bottling water based in the mountains."
"The aim of this research is to assess the power of the accounting profession on the international standard setting institutions after their reform in 2001. International accounting standard setting, technical and political process, can be studied through power relations. A theoretical framework is built on the basis of the theory of power of Lukes (1974, 2005). It is then applied to the study of the power of the accounting profession on the international standard-setter, focusing on the first dimension of the framework, the study of observable conflicts, and the third dimension, the study of latent conflicts. The application of the first dimension goes through the case-study of the development of IFRS 3 ""Business Combinations"". The results show that the IASB has not changed its position on the key issues of the project despite opposition from members of the accounting profession. The application of the third dimension goes through the study of the composition of the main bodies of the international standard-setter. The study of IFRS Foundation’s constitution and the analysis of the profile of the standard setters can highlight an increased presence of members of the large audit firms. The results of these two studies are finally compared, discussed and reconciled"
"The energy and political context in France suggests that households would have to deal with a strong constraint of CO2 emissions reduction in the next decades. Many questions then arise: Which technologies would enable this level of emission reduction? What policies should be implemented to achieve such a reduction ? What is the impact of these policies on household budget ? This PhD work tries to answer to these issues thanks to a residential and transports sectors TIMES model, which is a bottom-up model based on an optimization paradigm. This model relies on a highly disaggregated representation of households that allows a largely enhanced level of confidence in the results obtained, compared to other bottom-up models. Moreover, thanks to a survey we have launched among 2000 French households we are able to better design household energy consumption behavior. It is thus possible to take into account the constraints faced by the households and the tradeoffs they make between cost and comfort. This model is very useful for evaluating different policy tools considering their ability to lead to strong reductions and their impact on the household budget. A carbon tax then seems a good way to reduce CO2 emissions and subsidies seem to enhance the impact of the tax and help to reduce its distorting effect on household budget. "
"The semiconductor industry is a science-based sector, and an area where there is clearly a drive for intensive innovation and R&D. Its industrial dynamics are based on competence, skill acquisition and rapid product renewal in order to keep up (and reinforce) the strategic coordination activity described as Moore's law. In addition, these industrial dynamics relate to elaborating this strategic game to include more elements, known as ""More than Moore"", and to explore what this new coordinated design field could be. More specifically, the context of More than Moore is characterized by disruptive innovation and roadmaps are developed to structure these repeated (mostly planned) technological breakthroughs. The above context is visible in one of the world leaders in the semiconductor industry, STMicroelectronics, and the fast pace and new situation of More than Moore, requires that research evaluation and monitoring should involve original management tools. The activities reported in this thesis, are structured along three research lines: (1) research and absorptive capacity, (2) research and platform renewal and (3) research and industrial property. I suggest that classical research evaluation tools should be extended and discussed. 1-Research has often been considered as a way to improve ""absorptive capacity"". The design reasoning study in several research projects led us to distinguish Epistemic Absorptive Capacity from a Conceptual Absorptive Capacity. Highly innovative research activities consist in augmenting the latter capacity. 2-Research is often considered as a means to prepare future product generations. Modeling platform renewal logics led us to emphasize an advanced research role: design rule asset renewal. 3-Research is often considered as a way to enhance industrial property. The use of a method derived from C-K Theory (which is called C-K Invent), allowed the development of a new patent design capability. "

"Capacity to create, diffuse and exploit knowledge became one of the main sources of competitive advantage, of wealth generation and improvement of quality of life. This is why national decision makers seek to promote structures that favor creative interactions between actors with distributed and heterogeneous knowledge-base, such as public-private research partnerships within regional clusters of competitiveness. It appears however that geographic proximity of heterogeneous actors is not sufficient. Here we address the question of the extent to which ICT technologies can favor emergence of joint innovative projects between actors in private and public research. More than the technical dimension, we address modalities of implementation of specific solutions. When practices are uncertain and complex, because of the multitude of actors, we suggest that the concept of use will lead us to conclude that co-design of ICT solutions is necessary. We propose an implementation of this approach in the context of action research within the KMP project of Telecom Valley. This experimentation then leads us to emphasize construction of boundary objects in the Coevolution of design and use. "

"The customer relationship management represented the major preoccupation of companies and researchers these last years. According to the marketing authors, the notion of CRM (customer relationship management) meets to be the effective solution for the customer relationship management. Nevertheless, several publications and studies relative to the performance of this software gave contradictory results. It is in this context of paradoxical results that we undertook this research to estimate the impact of the use of this software on the company. By trying to exceed certain gaps and breach noticed in the literature so academic as manager, an abstract model of causal type was elaborated. This model is based on various relative theories on one hand, in the use of the capacities of the software CRM and on the other hand, in the marketing approach of the CRM. Having controlled the effects of the business sector, the size and the experience of companies in use of the software CRM, we tested this model on a sample 82 companies having developed all the features of the software CRM. The results showed the relevance of the model proposed with 74 % of the total variance of the performance of the life cycle of the customer. The research showed that the use of the software CRM on this population of companies is centred on one hand on the valuation of the analytical data and on the other hand on the collaboration between services of the company in the use of these data. The consideration of the notion of the life cycle of the customer can constitute a limit for this research but it shows the way for future researches"
"This research aims to define and assess the performance of a different logistics organization: the pooling of supply chains. It implies to design a pooled logistics network within several companies by sharing logistics resources (warehouses, distribution centers, transportation means, etc. ) and logistics systems, in order to improve supply chains' logistics performance. The performance of this new logistics organization was assessed by two criteria: primarily the environmental criteria measured by the CO2 emissions from transport and secondly economic consequences measured by the logistics cost. The difference between environment optimization and economic optimization was also examined. Two cases study were conducted in collaboration with French logistical organizations (Club Demeter and FEEF), respectively based on the major food suppliers and the small and medium food suppliers of the fast moving consumer goods in France. The optimization models for transport optimization aiming to minimize CO2 emissions or logistics cost were formalized and implemented in order to design pooled networks. The results obtained show that the pooling supply chains lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions from transport: between -20% and -50% according to the cases studied. The economic performance is less remarkable, but also often more beneficial than the current situation. This performance depends in particular on the relative evolution of transportation costs between rail and road. For example, carbon taxation could allow a better transport allocation from an environment and an economic standpoint. "
"Managing breakthrough innovation projects is a challenge that spans across organizations. Arguably, the tools used in managing and evaluating such projects should be largely different than traditional tools, due to the multidimensional uncertainty of breakthrough projects. However, studies show that most companies use conventional monitoring methods of project management, even in breakthrough innovation contexts. Based on a thirty-month intervention research in the Department of Research and Advanced Engineering at Renault, this PhD thesis analyses the inadequacies of traditional tools and suggests a new approach and adapted instruments. In partnership with R&D teams, an analysis of traditional practices and tools used for measuring projects value has been realized. We show two major drawbacks: a) these approaches focus on economic and strategic evaluations of projects and portfolios – excluding commitment mechanisms of internal stakeholders, b) most of such evaluation methods treat the uncertainties in an exogenous way. Based on these observations, a monitoring model combining three axis of project value is proposed: 1. A conditional use of economic analysis following risks, opportunities and maturity of innovation; 2. Qualification of strategic issues and associate management; 3. Monitoring of organizational impact and commitment mechanisms of internal design partners. Points 1 and 2 are improvements of existing approaches. However, building a commitment model has little equivalent in literature and practice. This dimension explains differentiated evolutions of projects within the firm. The model has been mobilized at Renault for projects process since 2009. "
"The European Union is completely redesigning the system of prudential supervision of insurance institutions as part of the Solvency Directive II. During its implementation, the Directive, which can be compared to the Basel II prudential standard, was analysed above all in terms of actuarial techniques. But this reform is also raising serious sociopolitical issues. By establishing new sectoral control of risks, insurers – the real inventors of the system – are demonstrating the political scope of the theory of auditability formulated by Power. Indeed the insurance institutions that co-defined the security standards to which they are going to be subjected attach more importance to promoting their compliance with the new prudential rules than to the efficiency of the system implemented. The potential consequences for the sector are therefore substantial. Insurance is actually running the risk of complete finaciarisation, to the detriment of its specific mission to protect. It could also seize this opportunity to reinvent its diversity. The context of the economic crisis, which led government officials to take an interest in regulatory systems, underscores the Foucaldian paradox of prudential superivision of the insurance industry: it is a matter of making security technology secure. In the context of financial post-Modernity, risk control is repoliticizing and is playing the role of confidence-booster in order to save the liberal model from its own sins"
"In this thesis, a simulation-based multi-objective optimization method is proposed for supply chain design under realistic conditions. The proposed approach is comprised of two building blocks: an optimizer and a simulation model builder. The optimizer, based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm, is used to direct the search for best-compromised solutions with respect to various conflicting criteria, such as cost and customer service level. The optimization variables incorporate not only the supply chain structure but also the system control parameters. Candidate solutions suggested by the optimizer are evaluated through simulation, which enables realistic evaluations taking into account uncertainties and dynamics along supply chain. The simulation model builder is developed to facilitate automatic model creation, which is a challenging issue as decision variables also involve the supply chain network structure. Two real-life case studies, from the automotive and textile industry, are presented to validate the proposed method and to illustrate its various features. "

"In this thesis we focus on Japon where venture capitalism has been introduced in the 1960s. We use the comparative institutional analysis framework to identify the causes of the change in the VC economic function which is in Japon : financing later stage firms to prepare their IPO. This is very different from the US case. We find that the causes are due a historical and a regulatory setting that has been reinforced by the organizational structures adopted by the VC firms. In Japon, hierarchical Vcs are dominant and this leads them to hands off (or arm's length) financing which needs little incubation support. This lack of implication reduces the ability of certifying the issuing firms in the IPO process. We also find an evidence of the historical legacy in the fact that only the subsidiaries of the top 3 underwriters are able to reduce the underpricing at the IPO. This happens when the parent company is the lead underwriter"
"Using qualitative and quantitative data, this dissertation investigates the anticipation and response strategies used by firms to deal with public disapproval and stigmatization. External audiences rely on organizational categories to make sense of the industry landscape. Categories are combinations of linguistic, symbolic, and substantive features that shape how social evaluations, positive or negative, are conveyed. Thus, association to certain categories can increase or decrease disapproval levels, and so can category straddling. To decrease future disapproval levels, firms can manage strategically the categories with which audiences associate them. Specifically, in the global arms industry, the categories that matter most are located at the home country, customer, and output levels. However, anticipation strategies are not always enough. Firms can be targeted by corporate scandal, a very stigmatizing form of disapproval. The dissertation demonstrates that in such cases firms implement response strategies that also modify categorical associations at the industry level, with the aim of loosening the ties that connect the targeted firm to the scandal, and the scandal to the rest of the firm’s partners in the industry. The dissertation contributes to strategy and organization theory, especially to research streams on industry evolution, categorization, and stigmatization"

"Flash floods, as it happened on September, the 8th and 9th 2002 in the Gard territory, can yield to important economic and human damages. After this catastrophic hydrological situation, a reform of flood warning services (SAC) was initiated. Thus, this political reform has transformed the 52 existing flood warning service into 22 flood forecasting service (SPC) which are more hydrologically consistent, and has created a national central service, the SCHAPI. A new effective hydrological forecasting mission has been assigned to these services. In the context of flash floods, the flood forecasting service Grand Delta (SPC-GD) uses the application ALHTAÏR integrating hydrometeorological data and real-time modeling capabilities of mountainous rivers' discharges. However, this service a limited hydrological forecast ability. Hence, this PhD attempts to enhance this forecasting competency using the purpose of the innovative Grid technology to provide on demand computing resources and collaborative environment. The methodology and experimentations have enabled to implement a hydrological spatial decision support system (G-ALHTAÏR) based on the resources of EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-science) grid architecture. Promising results demonstrate a capacity to model an important number of hydrological forecasts scenarios in an operational context and suitable with SPC-GD requirements. "
"Dans cette thèse, nous étudions différentes problématiques d'actualité en finance quantitative. Le premier chapitre est dédié à la stabilité de la propriété de semimartingale après grossissement de la filtration de base. Nous étudions d'abord le grossissement progressif d'une filtration avec des temps aléatoires et montrons comment la décomposition de la semimartingale dans la filtration grossie est obtenue en utilisant un lien naturel entre la filtration grossie initiallement et celle grossie progressivement. Intuitivement, ce lien se résume au fait que ces deux filtrations coincident après le temps aléatoire. Nous précisons cette idée et l'utilisons pour établir des résultats connus pour certains et nouveaux pour d'autres dans le cas d'un grossissement de filtrations avec un seul temps aléatoire. Les méthodes sont alors étendues au cas de plusieurs temps aléatoires, sans aucune restriction sur l'ordre de ces temps. Nous étudions ensuite ces filtrations grossies du point de vue des rétrécissements des filtrations. Nous nous intéressons enfin au grossissement progressif de filtrations avec des processus. En utilisant des résultats de la convergence faible de tribus, nous établissons d'abord un théorème de convergence de semimartingales, que l'on appliquera dans un contexte de grossissement de filtrations avec un processus pour obtenir des conditions suffisantes pour qu'une semimartingale de la filtration de base reste une semimartingale dans la filtration grossie. Nous obtenons des premiers résultats basés sur un critère de type Jacod pour les incréments du processus utilisé pour grossir la filtration. Nous nous proposons d'appliquer ces résultats au cas d'un grossissement d'une filtration Brownienne avec une diffusion retournée en temps et nous retrouvons et généralisons quelques examples disponibles dans la littérature. Enfin, nous concentrons nos efforts sur le grossissement de filtrations avec un processus continu et obtenons deux nouveaux résultats. Le premier est fondé sur un critère de Jacod pour les temps d'atteinte successifs de certains niveaux et le second est fondé sur l'hypothèse que ces temps sont honnêtes. Nous donnons des examples et montrons comment cela peut constituer un premier pas vers des modèles dynamiques de traders initiés donnant naissance à des opportunités d'arbitrage nocives. Dans la filtration grossie, le terme à variation finie du processus de prix peut devenir singulier et des opportunités d'arbitrage (au sens de FLVR) apparaissent clairement dans ces modèles. Dans le deuxième chapitre, nous réconcilions les modèles structuraux et les modèles à forme réduite en risque de crédit, du point de vue de la contagion de crédit induite par le niveau d'information disponible à l'investisseur. Autrement dit, étant données de multiples firmes, nous nous intéressons au comportement de l'intensité de défaut (par rapport à une filtration de base) d'une firme donnée aux temps de défaut des autres firmes. Nous étudions d'abord cet effet sous des spécifications différentes de modèles structuraux et sous différents niveaux d'information, et tirons, par l'exemple, des conclusions positives sur la présence d'une contagion de crédit. Néanmoins, comme plusieurs exemples pratiques ont un coup calculatoire élevé, nous travaillons ensuite avec l'hypothèse simplificatrice que les temps de défaut admettent une densité conditionnelle par rapport à la filtration de base. Nous étendons alors des résultats classiques de la théorie de grossissement de filtrations avec des temps aléatoires aux temps aléatoires non-ordonnés admettant une densité conditionnelle et pouvons ainsi étendre l'approche classique de la modélisation à forme réduite du risque de crédit à ce cas général. Les intensités de défaut sont calculées et les formules de pricing établies, dévoilant comment la contagion de crédit apparaît naturellement dans ces modèles. Nous analysons ensuite l'impact d'ordonner les temps de défaut avant de grossir la filtration de base. Si cela n'a aucune importance pour le calcul des prix, l'effet est significatif dans le contexte du management de risque et devient encore plus prononcé pour les défauts très corrélés et asymétriquement distribués. Nous proposons aussi un schéma général pour la construction et la simulation des temps de défaut, étant donné qu'un modèle pour les densités conditionnelles a été choisi. Finalement, nous étudions des modèles de densités conditionnelles particuliers et la contagion de crédit induite par le niveau d'information disponible au sein de ces modèles. Dans le troisième chapitre, nous proposons une méthodologie pour la détection en temps réel des bulles financières. Après la crise de crédit de 2007, les bulles financières ont à nouveau émergé comme un sujet d'intéret pour différents acteurs du marché et plus particulièrement pour les régulateurs. Un problème ouvert est celui de déterminer si un actif est en période de bulle. Grâce à des progrès récents dans la caractérisation des bulles d'actifs en utilisant la théorie de pricing sous probabilité risque-neutre qui caractérise les processus de prix d'actifs en bulles comme étant des martingales locales strictes, nous apportons une première réponse fondée sur la volatilité du processus de prix de l'actif. Nous nous limitons au cas particulier où l'actif risqué est modélisé par une équation différentielle stochastique gouvernée par un mouvement Brownien. Ces modèles sont omniprésents dans la littérature académique et en pratique. Nos méthodes utilisent des techniques d'estimation non paramétrique de la fonction de volatilité, combinées aux méthodes d'extrapolation issues de la théorie des reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Nous illustrons ces techniques en utilisant différents actifs de la bulle internet (dot-com bubble)de la période 1998 - 2001, où les bulles sont largement acceptées comme ayant eu lieu. Nos résultats confirment cette assertion. Durant le mois de Mai 2011, la presse financière a spéculé sur l'existence d'une bulle d'actif après l'OPA sur LinkedIn. Nous analysons les prix de cet actif en nous basant sur les données tick des prix et confirmons que LinkedIn a connu une bulle pendant cette période. Le dernier chapitre traite des variances swaps échantillonnés en temps discret. Ces produits financiers sont des produits dérivés de volatilité qui tradent activement dans les marchés OTC. Pour déterminer les prix de ces swaps, une approximation en temps continu est souvent utilisée pour simplifier les calculs. L'intérêt de ce chapitre est d'étudier les conditions garantissant que cette approximation soit valable. Les premiers théorèmes caractérisent les conditions sous lesquelles les valeurs des variances swaps échantillonnés en temps discret sont finies, étant donné que les valeurs de l'approximation en temps continu sont finies. De manière étonnante, les valeurs des variances swaps échantillonnés en temps discret peuvent etre infinies pour des modèles de prix raisonnables, ce qui rend la pratique de marché d'utiliser l'approximation en temps continu invalide. Des examples sont fournis. En supposant ensuite que le payoff en temps discret et son approximation en temps continu ont des prix finis, nous proposons des conditions suffisantes pour qu'il y ait convergence de la version discrète vers la version continue. Comme le modèle à volatilité stochastique 3/2 est de plus en plus populaire, nous lui appliquons nos résultats. Bien que nous pouvons démontrer que les deux valeurs des variances swaps sont finies, nous ne pouvons démontrer la convergence de l'approximation que pour certaines valeurs des paramètres du modèle"
"This thesis describes an interdisciplinary industrial safety framework. It is explained and illustrated through several steps. The first one, empirical, introduces a major accident investigation. It is shown on the one hand that this accident can be approached in the light of different disciplines (engineering, ergonomics, sociology, management, law) looking into technological, working, organisation, managerial and regulatory issues. The outcome does not belong to any institutionalised discipline and is an hybrid, at the crossroad. On the other hand, this accident indicates the dynamical and unique nature of technological accidents. These two points put together into a second step, lead toward an exploration of complexity, with a philosophical angle. This allows the third step to stress a specific cognitive 'style' for research pointing at the need in the contemporary scientific situation, to practice mul, inter and transdisciplinarity. After exploring both disciplines and complexity as a philosophical category, a industrial safety model is presented. The fourth step conceptualise, dynamically, links between several key dimensions of industrial safety, linking together technological and social ones. Finally, in the last step, the model is applied in a case study. It shows how the model offers guidance for collecting and interpreting data, relying on two approaches, one investigating in depth incidents, the other approaching normal operations. "
"We establish asymptotic links between two classes of stochastic volatility models describing the same derivative market : - a generic stochastic instantaneous volatility (SInsV) model, whose SDE system is a formal Wiener chaos without any specified state variable. - a sliding stochastic implied volatility (SImpV) class, another market model describing explicitly the joint dynamics of the underlying and of the associated European option surface. Each of these connections is achieved by layer, between a group of SInsV coefficients and set of (static and dynamic) SImpV differentials. The asymptotic approach leads to these cross-differentials being taken at the zero-expiry, At-The-Money point. We progress from a simple single-underlying and bi-dimensional setup, first to a multi-dimensional configuration, and then to a term-structure framework. We expose the structural modelling constraints and the asymmetry between the direct problem (from SInsV to SImpV) and the inverse one. We show that this Asymptotic Chaos Expansion (ACE) methodology is a powerful tool for model design and analysis. Focusing on local volatility models and their extensions, we compare ACE with the literature and exhibit a systematic bias in Gatheral's heuristics. In the multi-dimensional context we focus on stochastic-weights baskets, for which ACE provides intuitive results underlining the embedded induction. In the interest rates environment, we derive the first layer of smile descriptors for caplets, swaptions and bond options, within both a SV-HJM and a SV-LMM framework. Also, we prove that ACE can be automated for generic models, at any order, without formal calculus. The interest this algorithm is demonstrated by computing manually the 2nd and 3rd layers, in a generic bi-dimensional SInsV model. We present the applicative potential of ACE for calibration, pricing, hedging or relative value purposes, illustrated with numerical tests on the CEV-SABR model"

"This thesis aims at studying the changes that have taken place in the population registered with Caisses Primaires d'Assurance Maladie (Health Autorities in each French département), private bodies endowed with a public mission. For years now, media attention has been focusing on the sector of health coverage. Despite the deficit having basically causes unconnected with the management of the Caisses, they resulted in a trend toward a streamlining of the management. This is how circumstances brought about the emergence and development of management control. The amplitude of the evolution in management control depends on the Caisses. Hence the key question of the research : can one identify the factors thaht might explain the changes ? In the light of various theories and exploratory qualitative survey, I shall first demonstrate that there is a real need for management control, then suggest a model for the changes in the Caisses Primaires d'Assurance Maladie. Afterwards, the suggested model shall be tested by means of a quantitative survey which on the whole bears it out. Eventually, proposals shall be made to those in charge of the Caisses Primaires d'Assurance Maladie with a view to improve the implementation and development of management control. "

"The objective of this thesis is the understanding of learning and coupling phenomena during common design projects. We revisit the organizational learning model by the generic concept of coupling in order to propose an original analysis of organizational systems. This conceptual framework enables to study loose ant tight couplings which are representative, respectively, of formals and informal learning activities between individuals within collectives. These two kinds of coupling enable a dialectical approach which is adapted to analyze rational and indeterministic dimensions of an organization. Even if tight couplings prevail during a common design, our results show that loose couplings are essential because they do systemic regulations – such as feedbacks or self-organisations – enabling actors to learn in different ways. Finally, we present a list of behavioural, structural and environmental factors contributing to performance and reliability of a new organisation model qualified by the expression of complex enterprise.

"The objective of this thesis is to contribute as well on the theoretical level as empirical to the research on the links between the macro-economic policies and the social indicators and that in a context of the post-conflict country, the case of Rwanda. The main issue raised here to know what is really the economic policies which can be set up in a country post-conflict in order to reduce poverty within the households? Our thesis is based on two assumptions: First, the economic reforms should converge towards the economic growth and the reduction of poverty in the only condition which this growth is equitably distributed. In addition, we consider the political good-will and the stable macroeconomic environment. It is clear that it is difficult for a poor country as Rwanda which underwent during four years of the ethnic conflicts leading to a genocide waits at intervals of fast growth of its GDP per capita without setting up a parallel program of “family planning” in order to reduce the growth rate of its population estimated currently at 2,9%. It’s required also a solid program of the social sectors through the education and the health. To try to answer this question, we used the Model developed by the World Bank called “Poverty Analysis Macroeconomic Model”. PAMS is a model which link the households survey to the macro-economic framework. It’s evaluate the impact of macro-economic policies - in particular those associated the strategies of reduction of poverty - on employment with the centre of the various socio-economic groups, the households’s income, the incidence of poverty and the distribution of income. This thesis is articulated on four chapters; the first one which tried to the poverty under all its dimensions, it weaves the difference between the thresholds of poverty according to various authors; it analyzes then and measures the indicators relating to poverty. This first part of the thesis also makes the overall picture of the empirical literature in context of poverty, etc; finally, it defined and analyzes the Millenium Development Goals, and set out the level that Rwanda reached and the challenges to reach the vision 2020. The second chapter try to set out the links between economic growth and monetary and non monetary dimensions of poverty; it examine the inequalities resulting from this “growth”. It presents and analyzes briefly the evolution of the certain macroeconomic aggregates and principal measurements of economic policies in post-conflict context. The third chapter analyzes the decade 1990-2000, it makes initially the diagnosis of the year 1990, it analyzes different macro-economic incoherencies on which Rwanda Government was faced too during the period, the impact of the international community, the principal products of exports of Rwanda (coffee and tea), it makes then an outline on the political tendencies and the origin of the genocide of 1994 in Rwanda and the effects of this one on the socio-economic situation; this chapter releases the role of the international community in the genocide and finally compares the results of the economic reforms in end period 1990- 1995-2000. The fourth chapter finally brings additional information on the links between the growth and the poverty reduction using PAMS. This chapter makes simulations on the economic policies and judges the effect on poverty against different external shocks, the goal being not to reduce the poverty of half in a 2020, poverty located at 60% in 2003 but a scenario much more realistic to reduce poverty to 45, 6% in 2020. From the reference scenario, other simulations of economic policy were made by analyzing their effects on poverty and inequalities among different quintiles. We selected five of them:(I) modification of the volume of exports; (II) increase in the agricultural production; (III) the rise of the civil servant salaries and; (iv) modification of the composition of GDP growth and finally, to take an economic socio group like target of economic policy. In conclusion, this analytical work formulated some simulations and recommendations within the macroeconomic framework"

"This PhD dissertation deals with the comprehension of the origin of herding behaviors, in financial markets. After a literature review, the development of Scharfstein and Stein’s (1990) model enables us to structure several hypotheses on herding behavior, considered as a binary choice: to follow other agents or act as contrarian. Since herding behavior cannot be clearly proved by econometric tests, two alternative empiric approaches are successively envisaged. An exploratory questioning of portfolio managers bring fruitful testimonies on this topic. On the other hand, an experimental design, inspired from Cote and Sanders (1997), allows us to measure the variables at stake. The main contribution of this research is to provide concrete empiric elements on real herding behavior, and its reasons. The two essential factors revealed by these approaches are (1) the importance of the preservation of the manager’s reputation and (2) the inverse correlation between herding behaviors and the ability of actors.

"The research investigates and emphasizes the importance of boycotting which is an innovative, 'bottom-up' form of communication between the consumer and the firm which indicates that the needs of some consumers have not been understood. The work is largely conceptual in nature and consists of researching and modelling the various dimensions of boycotting. A definition of consumer boycotting is suggested and a predictive model is supplied to demonstrate the potential impact of boycotting on a targeted organization over the short, medium and long terms. A structural equation model was used to analyse the link between the motivations of those involved in various forms of boycotting as compared to its organizational impact. A twofold approach was used recognizing the cognitive and affective dimensions of boycotting at each stage of the model. In this manner management should be able to implement strategies to either avoid a potential boycott or to disentangle themselves from an existing one at low cost. "
"The environmental crisis is a major challenge for the twenty-first century capitalism: how companies can indeed become both ""green"" and competitive? An original response appears during the 1990s among engineers and designers with the practice known as ""eco-design"", which is now implemented in many large companies and innovative SMEs. This approach, which aims to redesign the goods and services to make them more durable, has brought many innovations such as life cycle analysis (LCA) which introduces a breakthrough in the way of mapping the environmental issues of an object by switching from the territory to the physical life cycle. But what are the strategic horizons involved in this industrial rationalization? Are there different ways to practice eco-design? And if so, what are their rationales and their effects? Based on different methods of investigation (research-interventions, genealogies of professions) and a logic of ""prospective of the present time"", this thesis shows that eco-design experiences in companies are following two ""rational myths"" (Hatchuel), the engineers one, from the reasoning of the LCA, and the designers one, based on the critical redesign of user-object relations, rational myths which are themselves connected to two possible strategic horizons. The first is the assessment on the markets: its objective is to instrument ""green markets"" with prescription devices such as the eco-labels, in which LCA works as a new norm of truth. In this horizon which is marked by rule-based eco-design approaches and competition by environmental standards strategies (e. G. Settlement of the eco-label), the LCA engineer appears to be a dominant player. The second horizon is the transformation of the self through tools to optimize or redesign a lifestyle (manuals for sustainable consumers, critical catalogs and fictions of designers). These approaches are here analyzed with Foucault's concept of technologies of the self and Ricoeur's concept of narrative identity. In this horizon where strategy plays as designing scenographies (Aggeri) we find that the designer is carrying out a more radical criticism through more innovative eco-design approaches that change together the identity of objects, markets and individuals. Thus, it is by taking into account the variety of these problematizations that eco-design will be able to provide innovative solutions to the challenges of sustainable development. "
"Real tool for understanding the causes and consequences of damaging or catastrophic events, the models of accident took place at the heart of critical approaches to accident investigations, and / or risk assessments within the socio-technical systems. Their effectiveness has been proven and many organizations are using them for answering a need for safety and performance requirements and progress. Many models of accident have been developed. Originally based on the principle of representation of a chain of events linked by cause and effect relationships, contemporary models are now based, for a minority even on systems theory and control theory, thus promoting systems analysis and a holistic view of accidents and disasters. Among latest modeling approaches, systemic accident model called STAMP (System-Theoretic Accident Modeling and Processes), developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and based on the concepts of ""constraint"", ""structure"" and ""Model of process"" was chosen in the framework of this thesis. This model assumes that accidents result from inadequate and ineffective control of the structure of a socio-technical system leading them to an accidental state. The thesis has three objectives. The first is to capture the epistemological, theoretical and methodological fundamentals underlying the STAMP. The second is the effective implementation of the model in the context of risk assessment of an innovative industrial process to clean up contaminated sediments. The third aims to assess the contributions and limitations of the model and propose with regard to the limits identified proposals to improve both the theoretical and methodological aspects. "
"The present dissertation attempts to answer to the following questions. (1) How does the development of the financial system favor economic growth, and thereby economic development? (2) What are the drawbacks of the development of the financial system? How to take full advantage of financial system development while minimizing the costs resulting from financial crises? The task consists of two main parts. In the first part, we set up simple endogenous growth models that establish a positive relationship between financial development (i. E. Financial intermediaries and stock markets development) and economic growth. We also investigate empirically the relationship in question. In the second part, we investigate the issues of the determinants of banking stability, contagion, and measures to foster financial stability. The main results findings are: (1) There is a positive between finance and economic growth. (2) Financial intermediaries stimulate economic growth if countries have attained a minimum initial level of education. The development of stock markets boosts economic growth if countries have a high level of initial income (threshold effect). (3) The direction of the causality between financial development and economic growth is country specific. It is either unidirectional or bi-directional, with more cases where finance Granger causes economic growth. (4) Banking crises are likely to occur every ten years or so, even if financial system has been stable (i. E. Absence of crises) until the year before the crises. (5) The US financial Market appears to be the leader in the world: a shock in US financial market rapidly contaminate other financial markets in the world. Whilst Hong Kong and Thailand appear to be the leading markets in Asia. The policy implications are: (a) Developing countries have interest to favor the development of their financial systems by progressively liberalizing their financial markets. (b) Developing countries should invest in education so that financial intermediaries that constitute the main component of their financial systems could foster their economic growth. (c) An international financial coordination in prudential supervision and regulation policies is required in order to minimize the costs of financial crises"
"Our research is motivated by an observation. Employee Ownership is a form of savings that is becoming more and more sought after these days. The concentration of the employee savings into employee ownership is becoming stronger. These evolutions translate into a fact: employees facing a savings menu tend to choose Employee Ownership. The high exposure to risk of the employee-shareholders might have some consequence for their assets and their job. For companies, the cost of this exposure to risk can also be high. These observations have led us to wonder about the causes of employees’ investments in their company stock. Thus, this research tries to answer the question: Which are determinants of employees’ investments in their employer’s stock? We will specifically focus on the case of Employee Ownership in the French company savings plan (PEE). We can find several results through the empirical study. The exploratory phase shows the influence of the French legal system on the investment choice of employees. It makes it possible to identify four groups of determinants of employees’ investment in their company stock: the employee stock purchase plans, the context of employee savings, the company’s and the employees’ characteristics. Concerning the results of the quantitative analysis, they deal with the effect of several dependent variables on three dimensions of the employee investment decision of a company that is quoted on the stock exchange. We first of all analyze the decision of participating in the employee stock purchase plan. For those employees who have subscribed to the employee stock purchase plan, we will then study the determinants of the amount invested. The dependent variable is the total amount of the subscription to the company’s stocks. Finally, we analyse the relationship between the dependent variables and the exposure to employee ownership. The dependent variable is thus the percentage of the total employee savings invested in employer’s stocks after the employee stock purchase plan. Most of the obtained results are significant and similar for the three decisions that have been considered (the participation, the intensity of the participation and the concentration of savings into employee ownership). However, some results diverge indicating the different nature of three decisions that have been analyzed. "

"Considering the co-existence of specifically dedicated devices (like for instance Collectif des Femmes in Leuven)and generic devices such as ""Boutiques de Gestion"" for training migrant and ethnic entrepreneurship in France, the author of this work builds a new model of ethnic and migrant entrepreneurship which differs from the usual minority theories which generally only consider ethnic resources and networks and focus on group dynamics. This model is based on Inter-cultural psychology and on French Theory of conventions. This model is an illustration of the dialectical and teleogical prospect GREENE and alii (2003) recommended for analizing Minoruty entrepreneurship in a more complex way. Based on this model and on observed datas, the author defends the thesis that to analize and train correctly migrant entrepreneurship in France, one needs to know about the individual integration strategy of the migrant. After describing the specificities and diversity of Migrant Entrepreneurship in France, a managerial model is proposed for helping entrepreneurship trainers. This model was applied in a French generic device : a ""Boutique de Gestion"""

"Slum policies play an important role in poverty alleviation efforts at the local scale and at the national scale - as poverty becomes increasingly 'urban' phenomena. However, poverty reduction is rarely positioned as the main objective of slum policies and, when occurring, is an indirect result of their application. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a more complete understanding of how slum policies affect households' welfare. To explore these issues, two slum-upgrading interventions are used as case studies: the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme in Mumbai (India) and Urban Integral Projects in Medellin (Colombia). This research has addressed issues ranging from the causes of post-rehabilitation residential mobility to the impacts of slum rehabilitation on households' access to credit as well as the effects of Urban Renewal Projects on housing consolidation. We used recent evolution in empirical economics methodologies that allow comparing policy beneficiaries to non-beneficiaries. In the case of Mumbai a household's survey was carried out by the author in 9 slum pockets, 4 of which had already been rehabilitated and 5 to-be rehabilitated slums. In the case of Medellin household level information was obtained from three secondary sources (the Quality of Life Survey, the Medellin Solidaria Survey and the SISBEN Survey) that allowed following a set of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries before and after Urban Renewal Projects took place.

"The constituent articles of this dissertation analyze the financial market failures traditionally identified by economists (associated with externalities, information asymmetries and incompleteness of markets) and the policy responses. A central observation is that public interventions have almost never resulted from a cold analysis of these market failures but are decided in a hurry to respond to the most obvious shortcomings observed during a crisis. This pragmatic and a-theoretical approach leads to poorly calibrated interventions. These articles are addressing in particular the lender of last resort policy that encourages the issuance of various short-term debts by financial institutions and feeds systemic risk. They also highlight the risks of certain reforms decided after the ""subprime"" crisis. Governments should focus on the provision of public goods clearly identified by economic analysis (control of ""agents"" and information), and should not multiply risky interventions that sometimes create more market imperfections than they claim to solve."
"At the height of the crisis, the international monetary system is powerless to reduce theinstability of exchange rates, the imbalance of the current account of balance ofpayments, instability of exchange rates and the development of speculation in financialmarkets the and the asymmetry between net exporters countries and net deficits countries.This thesis, which had the merit of opening new tracks in order to understand thecomplex relationships between global imbalances and the actual system, showed thatthese global imbalances are intrinsically linked to the failures of the internationalmonetary structure. To stop the deterioration of global imbalances, we propose that thesystem turns towards an international system payment with the creation of aninternational currency and a clearing house. This thesis, which reactualizes the KeynesPlan, also includes statutory dispositions for automatically adjusting the external debt tothe capacities payment of countries. Although this reform is a step forward, we don’t hidethe progress that can be done to reduce external imbalances. To increase the efficiencyand sustainability of the international payments system, it is useful to boost thecooperation between central banks, particularly in a context marked by the external debtcrises. In this sense, this thesis shows the opportunities which offered the creation ofregional monetary zones which are integrated in a monetary union international"
"The Bolivian urban system is outstanding : three major cities concentrate about half of the nation’s population and employment. Their territories’ trajectories lead us to question their economic role in the face of the successful economic achievement of Potosi and Tarija, territories well endowed in natural resources. We wanted to highlight the Bolivian current territorial tripolarization, firstly by studying its emergence, through the study of their economical history; secondly, by investigating the most recent economical data in order to display the strengths and weaknesses of this tripolarized system. Each component of the tripole is situated in a different geographical setting. In the West, La Paz, where the government is based, belongs to a mountainous region of high plateaus; in the East, Santa Cruz, 900 km distant, belongs to the central area of Amazonian plains, whereas Cochabamba rests between those two, in the region of intermediate valleys. This tripolarization is recent ; Urban hierarchy previously dominated by a major city is now characterized by three of them ranking first in this hierarchy. The specific emergence of such a system in Bolivia, together with the abundance of natural resources in certain territories, contributes to explaining the current situation, which has been analyzed using indicators of economical activity and of the international role of the territories. This economical approach combined with geographical, demographical, historical, political and human development elements, helps us to disclose two different but complementary logics: a kind of territorial domination of La Paz - Cochabamba - Santa Cruz, permitted though made vulnerable by the exploitation of natural resources in Potosi and Tarija"
"The online community (OC) is a popular form of specialized knowledge transfer, where geographically dispersed users can for a community by sharing ideas, send and post messages, debate topics, and forge online friendships. One of the problems with OC’s is that they tend to have a life cycle, where there is the birth and growth of the OC but then there is a stagnant stage where users stop posting to the OC and the community eventually dies due to inactivity. Trying to extend the vibrant growth stage of an OC is a relevant topic for any administrator of an OC. One way that an OC can stay vibrant is to encourage contributions.This research stream will look at how OC’s can keep their vibrancy for a longer period of time, by looking at various aspects of OC’s such as measures of user contribution and how new users in an OC behave. I propose to use different measures to evaluate users contributions to an OC. One of these measures is a non-invasive bibliometric measure using the Hirsch-index methodology as a way to identify high-level contributors. Another stream of this research will look at how new users behave and how this might be explained by preferential attachment."
"Today, companies require a higher customer participation in service experiences. This research aims at studying the relationship between customer support, motivation to participate and customer productivity from the company point of view, through qualitative and quantitative studies. The qualitative research is founded on two complementary studies: the first one is based on customer comments in store, the second one on the customer journey analysis. The quantitative research is subdivided in two parts. First, the relationship between customer support (availability, nature and medium) and customer productivity is analyzed through the observation of 557 customer journeys. Then, the influence of motivation paths (emotions and rational motivation) are studied in a scenario based study in order to consider how customer support increases customer productivity.Research contributions are methodological and theoretical.  This research brings a new methodology to study participation: the customer productivity is measured through the observation of customer real behavior and not through a declarative process. On a theoretical perspective, the customer support availability increases customer productivity and the emotions are a way to motivate customers to participate. These contributions lead companies to implement new processes to increase customer productivity and self-service activities during the service experience."
"Every year, more than 400 natural disasters hit the world. To assist those affected populations, humanitarian organizations store in advance emergency aid in warehouses. This PhD thesis provides tools for support decisions on localization and sizing of humanitarian warehouses. Our approach is based on the design of representative and realistic scenarios. A scenario expresses some disasters’ occurrences for which epicenters are known, as well as their gravity and frequency. This step is based on the exploitation and analysis of databases of past disasters. The second step tackles about possible disaster’s propagation. The objective consists in determining their impact on population on each affected area. This impact depends on vulnerability and resilience of the territory. Vulnerability measures expected damage values meanwhile resilience estimates the ability to withstand some shock and recover quickly. Both are largely determined by social and economic factors, being structural (geography, GDP, etc.) or political (establishment or not relief infrastructure, presence and strict enforcement of construction standards, etc.). We propose through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify, for each territory, influential factors of resilience and vulnerability and then estimate the number of victims concerned using these factors. Often, infrastructure (water, telecommunications, electricity, communication channels) are destroyed or damaged by the disaster (e.g. Haiti in 2010). The last step aims to assess the disaster logistics impact, specifically those related to with: transportation flows capacity limitations and destruction of all or part of emergency relief inventories. The following of our study focuses on location and allocation of a warehouses’ network. The proposed models have the originality to consider potential resources and infrastructure degradation after a disaster (resilience dimension) and seek optimizing the equilibrium between costs and results (effectiveness dimension). Initially we consider a single scenario. The problem is an extension of classical location studies. Then we consider a set of probable scenarios. This approach is essential due to the highly uncertain character of humanitarian disasters. All of these contributions have been tested and validated through a real application case: Peruvian recurrent disasters. These crises, mainly due to earthquakes and floods (El Niño), require establishment of a first aid logistics network that should be resilient and efficient."
"The present thesis is a contribution to the analysis of the relationship between the real and the financial sector of the economy. The corresponding gap in the scientific literature is closed. It is concluded that the classical concept of the ""wages fund"", after some modifications, can serve as a useful tool in the macroeconomic analysis of the financial market. This approach simplifies the study and the exact description of the real functions accomplished by the financial market. It is maintained that the function of this market consists in allocating the available fund of consumers' goods - the wages fund - to those places where it is needed the most. So there is a very close relationship between the financial market and the satisfaction of human needs. The second important concept for the analysis of the relationship between the real and the financial sector is the value of money. We argue that money is only accepted in business and on the financial market because it has the power to purchase consumers' goods. If it did not have this power, nobody would be ready to exchange a real good against it. So in allocating the monetary savings, the financial market, in real terms, indeed allocates the available consumers' good. The analysis of the value of money thus opens up the way to a new conception of the real side of the financial market based on the wages fund theory. We apply our results to empirical data of the German economic crisis of 1873, which very much resembles the recent financial crisis on the occidental financial markets. "

"The purpose of this research is to study the impact of redefining the role of first-line managers on their legitimacy, as well as the eventual implications on the management of the team. The literature underlines some evolution of the role, particularly as a consequence of changes in work organization and of the evolution of Human resources. Empirical data collected first through an exploratory study then through a more thorough study, show that the legitimacy of ""1st HR managers"" with France Telecom has been undermined. This is mainly explained by the fact that their new role no longer requires them to have deep knowledge of the job of the team they manage. It is this rational-legal dimension of legitimacy (in the sense of the Weber theory) that has been most reduced through the redifinition on the role. This reduction of the legitimacy is coexistent with the limited efficiency of managers when seeking to gain the support of the staff to the firm's orientations. This mainly leads to some fatalism in response to the evolutions required by the managers. The main contributions of this research are theoretical. The theoretical frame transfers and adapts Weber's legitimacy sources to first-line managers. The results of this study contribute to the literature on first-line management and confirm the finding of the sociology of managerial action. "
"The aim of this thesis is to define the role of craft guilds in the emergence and extension of the medieval european markets. It comes within the framework of the New Economic History which uses explicitly the economic theory to interpret history. The contributions of the economics of information are particularly successful in analysing an organization as complex as the medieval craft guilds. Asymmetric information about product quality explains the logical birth of these organizations by highlighting their positive role in the structuralization of markets and the definition of regulating rules in industrial and commercial activities. Adverse selection and moral hazard allow to justify the relevance of the medieval agents choice to resort to an organization rather than the market. The contrast between this essay and the conventional monopolistic wisdom could not be starker. Usually described as inefficient cartels, we show that craft guilds mitigated the failings of the medieval markets. At first, they encouraged men to make mutually advantageous trades ; trades they would not have made if guilds had not mitigated adverse selection and moral hazard. Then, complex interactions between authorities, merchant guilds and craft guilds removed to these last ones the possibility of implementing monopoly policy. Finally, these organizations contributed to create an institutional structure favourable for human capital accumulation and technological innovation. This new view contends craft guilds encouraged commerce and increased economic efficiency. "
"This research aims to show the importance of spin-off as a tool around which various organizational strategies can be articuled. In this respect, a number of strategic coalitions and close links are etablished among the different entities constituting spin-off. So, the nature and intensity of these relationships depend on the nature of the adopted spin-off strategy as well as the endogenous rationale associated with it. Thus, in order to shape a better understanding of the procedure, this research suggests, based on a theorical and typological framework, a practical outline which highlights the multiple dimensions of spin-off. Consequently, an abductive research strategy based on multiple case studies has been implemented."
"The management of risk activities involves many decisions that concern a group of actors with different areas of expertise or action to design or operate a complex system. First, we focus on the role of an interactive group decision support system (GDSS) in the management of risk activities. The functionalities of the system are specified so as to minimize the impact of human and organizational errors that may affect collective decision-making. The GDSS is seen as the mediator between human beings and the system they aim to control: it supports them detecting critical situations, understanding situations, interpreting and diagnosing before remedy, but it also promotes collective resolution as a medium for communication and coordination of stakeholders. The decision is seen as a dynamic process whose response time depends on the efficiency with which the deliberation phase is managed. Several variables and models to control the debate are thus proposed. A first type of decisional situation depicts a manager who requires the support of a panel of experts to make a decision based on a process of fusion of expert advice. The uncertainty attached to the evaluation of alternatives is due in part to the imprecision of expert opinion, divergences of opinion between experts. A control model is proposed to manage this uncertainty and identify the criteria on which to focus the panel discussion. We then turn to the concept of influence in a social network to offer two models of control of the deliberation phase. One is based upon argued deliberation and the other one on stochastic simulations with a formalism of state equations to represent the evolution of beliefs during the debate. Next, decisions that concern improvement of a complex system are presented. Strategic and operational points of view are confronted in such a process. When achievable goals are negotiated, a model based on a problem of constraint programming techniques is used to compute the most efficient actions to be carried out to perform the improvement. In this case, either the collective is seen as a set of collaborative agents and deliberation is driven by an efficient decision; or the agents are simply cooperative, with collective goals but individual issues and thus the negotiation model is based on argumentation theory. Our models all deal with the control of a cognitive process, i. E. , collective decision: cognitive automation aims to reduce human and organizational errors that could affect the decision in particular assessment and coordination errors. Conclusion and perspectives complete this manuscript which is illustrated with several examples related to the management of risk activities. "
"The drying-up of liquidity and freezing of the interbank markets during the crisis of 2007 led to the debasement of banks' balance sheets. At the same time, both bank lending and business production suffered from the drop in consumer demand. The near-collapse of Bear Stearns and failure of Lehman Brothers are both characterized as liquidity shocks that had a greater impact on financially fragile non-financial firms. In the second half of 2008, after a series of bankruptcies of large financial institutions, the U.S. Treasury poured capital infusions into domestic financial institutions under the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), thus helping to avert a complete collapse of the U.S. banking sector. Government regulators had to distinguish between those banks deserving of being bailed out and those that should be allowed to fail. The results of this study show that the CPP favored larger financial institutions whose potential failure represented higher degrees of systemic risk. This allocation of CPP funds was cost-effective from the point of view of taxpayers, as such banks reimbursed the government for their CPP bailouts sooner than expected. In contrast, smaller banks that were heavily into mortgage-backed securities, mortgages, and non¬performing loans were less likely to be bailed out. Finally, the effectiveness of the CPP is analyzed in chapter 4 in terms of restoring banks' loan provisions. Banks that have a higher level of capitalization tend to lend more both during the crisis and in normal rimes. Moreover, bailed-out banks that repurchased their shares from the V.S. Treasury provided more loans during the crisis than those banks that did not."
"This dissertation analyses the functioning of domiciliary eldercare, a market mainly characterised by uncertainty on quality. Drawing on the economics of information, quality and conventions, the analysis is based on a questionnaire-based inquiry among 530 older people and a surve of 14 suppliers and 4 coordinating structures. The first part presents the difficulties concerning the coordination on the market, the sources of development of the market and the main issues about quality. The second part offers an economic analysis of uncertainty, through a discussion of the interest and limits of economic theories of choice under uncertainty. Definitions of quality and qualitative uncertainty are proposed. The main results of the survey among elder people are presented in the third part. The goal of this empirical research was to understand how people make choice in a market with no differentiation of suppliers’ qualities. Resulting from several factor analyses, typologies of behavior and choice under uncertainty are proposed. The fourth part illustrates the role of trust and networks in the coordination of this market. Some organisational models associated to quality conventions are analysed further. The analysis of the stability of these models emphasises the existence of a multi-conventional quality model at the core of domiciliary eldercare services."
"This study of HR practices in medium-sized enterprises emphasizes on the significative influence of organizational and institutional factors. In this research, we examine these HR practices through an approach which integrates mobilized theories. We also point-out the specificities of these HRpractices in terms of: 1/ differentiation and structural hybridity, 2/ institutional legitimacy and 3/ relational complexity.Based on a methodology of qualitative research, this empirical study includes 40 interviews, 13 of which were part of two case studies. These interviews with different HR actors allow to make comparisons between medium-sized enterprises of different sizes.In light of the specificities of the medium-sized enterprises, our results highlight a variety of HR practices. Our research confirms that beyond the leader, there is a strong interest for a « nonconsensual » approach of HR practices, given that the hierarchy was forced to play a lesser role after the arrival of the managers. Our results show that in medium-sized enterprises, HR practicesare personal, conformist, pseudo-conformist, pseudo-innovative and innovative."
"While the issue of cluster dynamics has been poorly addressed in the literature, cluster models actually display different levels of collaboration and different levels of adaptability to change. However, difficulties to consider industrial clusters in its environment lead to reduce clusters as attraction areas given the homogenisation of its member characteristics. In order to go past this ad hoc approach, our contribution aims at identify cluster dynamics to improve the understanding of this model regarding performance (competition and collaboration dynamics) and social and geographic setting (structural and relational embeddedness). Through recourse to the literature on proximity, we analyse the modalities of coordination of organisations within clusters for the creation of localised specific assets. This thesis develops the idea that cluster dynamics are governed by two coevolutive relational logics: short-term strategies as common problem solving processes according to a professional logic; the setting up of long-term relations as patrimonial alliances reinforcing the embeddedness between actors according to a historic logic. Both logics allow us to jointly consider the two temporal perspectives of cluster members strategies (search for flexibility, sustainability of activities) and interaction dynamics (strengthening of embeddeness and decoupling). We develop a simulation model to assess the consequences of the two strategies on clusters: network structure and resulting forms of embeddedness, as well as individual and collective performance of its members. We apply this theoretical framework to the specialised plant cluster located in the Pays-de-la-Loire region. "

"In a complex economic environment, the involvement of managers in training theiremployees seems important. In a French automotive group and a multinational in digitalsecurity, we try to identify the different roles of managers in training, the effects of theseroles, challenges and finally the requirements to carry out these roles.Now, managers live discomfort and it is certain that their position confronts them tomultiple constraints. Work and training activities merge more and more: work activities areplaced at the heart of education and training activities are investing in the workplace: hencethe need to study managers’ roles in the formal and informal training.To answer our research goal, we used the qualitative research method by semistructuredinterviews. It found that managers are heavily involved in training: from animatingtraining sessions until monitoring and knowledge transfer in day to day activities.Our research highlights the “trainer” roles of the manager in a context of instability.Indeed, the personal involvement of managers to train their team can be largely explained bythe complexity of the context that requires from them to act urgently to overcome failures dueto the complexity and the slowness of the formal training process."
"This paper augments the existing literature related to the concistency concept that critically discusses the meaning of « consistency », its theoretical restraints and its practicability. An interpretation of the consistency concept using systems theory leads to the conclusion that « consistency » is to be interpreted as a « social equilibrium » of a national accounting system. Therefore an historical grown interpretation of « consistency » cannot be used as an appraisal benchmark for foreign accounting systems. This concern corresponds with the usual criticism addressed to the normative concistency notion. Despite this criticism the paper argues that the consistency discourse can result in an essential contribution to the development of an accepted, theoretically well-founded international accounting system."
"One of e-commerce development implications is the metamorphosis of all marketing-mixaspects. Especially, new price forms have emerged, leading both academicians and managers to deal with new challenges. Prices with more than one component, known as complex prices, become the main form used within this channel. The dominant stream of marketing research interested within this area has focused on cognitive biases that affect complex price judgments. Most researchers have recommended managers to use this form of price in a manner that reduce perceived price, and therefore enhance sales. Regarding the lack of research considering negative effects of such tactics, the principal aim of this work is to put the spotlight on complex price incidence on its perception within three aspects: (1) the determination of visual presentation forms that may damage this perception (2) the effects of such presentation forms on complex price perceived fairness, and consequently, on determinant variables such as offer value and purchase intentions (3) and the control of moderating variables associated with situational differences. The results of an experiment conducted on 504 respondents show the presence of a degradation of complex price perceivedfairness caused by its visual presentation form, with a determinant contribution of the process: procedural fairness is henceforth an essential pillar of an offer judgment."
"The Quantity Theory of money which always links the increase in the high-Powered money supply and the general rise in prices is one of the oldest concepts in economics. After to have been the subject of many controversies at different times, it seems nowadays to hold less attention from the economists because the dispute is dissipated in a kind of religious choice to believe or not to believe to quantity theory. This theory officially influences the monetary policy of most of central banks in the world that bind conventional measures to control the money supply to curb inflation process. In many orthodox economics’ textbooks, the quantity theory is still deployed in perpetuum to explain the price crisis in history.By using the methods of political economy, we will counterbalance the economic facts like they are recorded and the economic theory; our thesis aims to provide a critical assessment of orthodox monetary doctrines based on the quantity theory, in the interpretation of historical price crises. Our approach relies on a factual reinterpretation of two major historical price crises in Europe, and we will seek to see if the quantity theory is relevant. Thereby, the “price revolution” of the sixteenth in Europe and the German hyperinflation are two periods of price crisis where the quantity theory is insufficient to explain all sides of the problem studied. Yet the quantity conception of money is much transformed over time, based each time on the doctrines of equilibrium and value. Our thesis is back critically in details on all aspects of this transformation: the contribution from the classics until the neoclassical School, all with a focus on the contribution of Keynes, to account for the long survival of quantity thinking in monetary economics."
"This dissertation studies the role of criticism in the social construction of markets. Fair Trade, and especially ethical fashion, are analyzed as extreme cases of moral uncertainty related to the organization of markets. The qualitative analysis of secondary data, observations, interviews, and artefacts enables us to follow the actors through perfomative controversies. Inspired by French pragmatic sociology (Boltanski, Callon, Latour), this research highlights the process of framing, reframing and overframing that makes the compromises on values and market rules more or less stable. Historically, the frame of fair clothes values the production process of goods. Then, in the 2000’s, the emergence of pure players contributes to reframe fair clothes to fashion goods. Finally, at the end of the 2000’s, conventional brands of the fashion market raise controversies by involving in the ethical fashion markets. More precisely, this research studies the endeavour of the Ethical Fashion Show to organize the market. It aims at making three contributions. First, it proposes the notion of market entre-preneurship to describe the activity consisting in making compromises between market and its criticisms. Second, it highlights the notion of economic performativity by clarifying the multiple ways that criticisms shape market agencements. Third, it sheds light on the material and spatial dimensions of the social construction of markets by analyzing devices of qualification, disqualification and control."
"In Tunisia, enrollment rates in tertiary education had soared up over the past two decades. A significant increase of student annual flows imposed the implementation of reforms that led to an increase in the number of higher education institutions and universities. One of the challenges in Tunisia and many African countries is to improve the efficiency of education systems to promote employability and graduates employment. This thesis discuss the question of the efficiency of education from an economic approach based on returns to education in the labor market. The first chapter analyses private returns to education particularly higher education in African countries. Our findings highlight the large differences to RORE estimates across countries, particularly when it takes into account the employment rate. The second chapter focuses on the impact of university quality on labor market outcomes in Tunisia. The empirical results suggest that institutions selectivity and university professor’s qualifications seem to affect earnings of graduates. The third chapter focuses on the evaluation of reform of university curriculum providing entrepreneurship education to Tunisian university students. This research based on randomized assignment to the entrepreneurship track measure its impacts on labor market outcomes as well as on intermediary outcomes such as business skills and behavioral skills. This chapter underlines the role of entrepreneurship program."

"We evaluate the ALMP’s with a particular attention to the differentiation of impacts by categories of programmes and categories of beneficiaries. These two forms of heterogeneity can in fact lead to erroneous evaluations or too partial:i)	The heterogeneity of programmes proposed, in particular their characteristics (type of contract, duration, remuneration, training, etc.) are an important source of complexity in behavior of self-selection of job seekers: behaviors can be multiples and strategic.ii)	The heterogeneity of target-populations (low-skilled, youth, women, priority category, first-job seekers, etc.) is an important source of complexity in the behavior selection of employment advisor.There is finally no reason that different types of programmes have the same average effect on various public as well. We evaluate so ALMP’s on multiple criteria of effectiveness (heterogeneity of criteria)."
"The purpose of this work is to analyze the influence of CEO’s compensation package on the risk taking behavior of the firm. We focus on the financial incentives contained in equity based compensation and their interaction. Our sample consists of US firms for the period 1992-2005. The data come from the Compustat and Execucomp databases. The purpose of the first chapter explores the link between CEO’s compensation and the financial constraints of the firm. In a second chapter, we empirically analyze the effect of financial incentives on the risk of investment. We use Research and Development expenses level as a proxy of the risk of investment. In a third chapter, we focus on target debt leverage level determinants using a dynamic adjustment model. In the last chapter we analyze default risk determinants. The main result of this work is that the efficiency of risk incentive is highly dependent of CEO’s performance incentive reaching a given threshold."
"This thesis examines the impact of institutions, especially the financial institutions, on international trade and foreign direct investments. The first four chapters study the financial institutions and their impact on trade and international specialization. Specifically, the first chapter examines these financial institutions and the determinants of their level of development. The second chapter examines how finance impacts bilateral trade. The third chapter builds a theoretical model and aims to explain the impact of finance on the sectoral trade as a function of the degree of financial intensity of each sector. The fourth chapter analyzes the heterogeneous impact of finance on the different manufacturing sectors. The last chapter of the thesis uses the term ""institution"" in a broader sense and studies theoretically and empirically whether the similarities and differences in institutional environments across countries explain the international patterns of foreign direct investment (FDI)."
"The research aims to understand the perception of the performance concept by cluster actors. We focus on clusters which are not controlled by a leading firm, but include strategic governance institutions. Despite a vast literature on clusters, researches on the perception of their performance are still emerging. Supported by an interpretative framework to clarify what can cover the concept of performance in a cluster, this research, mobilizing social representation theory, explores the perception of heterogeneous actors composing French seaports, using the methodology of cognitive maps. 36 interviews were conducted with participants of the main French Seaports. The results show that the shared representations are fairly limited in terms of meta-criterias and performance determinants, but identifies common logics, paradigms and representations classes. The results also show that there is a frequent focalisation of the perceptions on very few keys actors involved in the service chain. The study concludes on the management control perspectives in these clusters."
"The main objective of this thesis is to examine the impact of internal governance mechanisms on tax risk in the Tunisian context. The concepts of tax risk and tax risk management were defined in the first chapter. The second chapter presented the theoretical framework of our study. In fact, game theory provides a suitable framework for analyzing the behavior of the two main actors in the context of this study, firms and tax authority, vis-à-vis the tax risk. Governance stakeholder theory was also mobilized to examine the role of governance mechanisms in reducing tax risk. Assumptions from this theory assumes the existence of a negative effect of board independence, separation of the positions of CEO and Chairman of the Board,  accounting or fiscal expertise of the audit committee and accounting or tax expertise of the internal audit function on the tax risk. Our research methodology involves three steps. First, a content analysis of tax judgments between businesses and tax administration has identified various types of firm tax risks detected during the control and confirmed by judicial proceedings. Second, the content analysis of financial statements and reports of the auditors of listed Tunisian firms over a period of five years has emphasized the existence of tax risk disclosures in accordance with regulatory requirements. Finally, logistic regression analysis has highlighted the role played by the board of directors and the external advisor in the accounting management of tax risk. This analysis also showed that the actors who have an impact on the accounting management of tax risk differ between financial and non-financial firms. Overall, the analysis of the interaction between governance and tax risk identified actors who are actively involved in the accounting management of tax risk. These actors appear in favor of the tax transparency of the company in respect of stockholders and tax authorities. Thus, this thesis fits into the broader issues of corporate social responsibility."
"Tunisia experiences a noticeable growth in health expenditures and in Tunisians’ life expectancy. However, there are inequalities in health care access that motivated a reform of the health insurance which took place in 2007. The main changes were the improvement of the coverage for chronic diseases and the expansion of the access to insurance for care provided in the private sector. This PhD uses a micro econometric approach to examine the impact of this reform on access to health care and the out of pocket (OOP) born by individuals. The estimations are implemented on two surveys realized in 2005 and 2010 and relative to several thousand individuals. We first present the motivations of the reform. Then we analyze the individual insurance choice and its influence on the use of public or private care providers in 2010, i.e. after the reform. To evaluate this reform, we use a double difference approach. In total, our results show that the 2007 reform has attained many of its objectives: improvement of health care access for National Social Security Fund’s (NSSF) members, better access for private health care, decrease of OOP and catastrophic health expenses for individuals with chronic diseases."
"The study reveals a multidisciplinary character concerning, in the first time, the economy of the sustainable development, economy of the environment and ecological economy.In the second time, we will study precisely, the way public policies on energy are carried out and regarded at, on a continental, national and territorial ladder, by leaning on the political data of the macroeconomics of energy politics for Europe, France and finally the Corsican region. The frame of the analysis was delimited by an applied formal perimeter, and inscribes itself in a continuum of integration of sustainable development as an aim. All the aspects of the particular situation of Corsica due to its insularity will be approached and studiedA multicriteria simulation and evaluation of different energy scenarios which will conclude our work. The objective here is to determine the best possible ways for Corsica to source its energy in the future.This includes the construction of scenarios, a presentation of the research typology of a multicriteria evaluation, including a summary of the scientific literature applied to energy scenarios as part of the multicriteria evaluation, and a synthesis of multicriteria problematic, as well as a development concerning the choice of the applied method.The results of our study point out a strong preference for the scenario of sustainable development. They determine the best possible compromise between the different hypothetical scenarios according to our chosen criteria. Our obtained result points out that sustainable development offers the best solutions to local given problems."
"Death is the unescapable event that most of individuals want to hide motivated by a fundamental will to stay alive. Because it can be source of mystery, fascination and anxiety, this topic has been of specific interest in psychology thanks to the Terror Management Theory (TMT). This theory enables to understand how fear of death is fundamentally anchored in the human nature and the defense mechanisms that are used in response to death reminders that are aroused by the mortality salience situation. This doctoral research aims at filling the gap in the litterature on TMT while studying specifically the impact of mortality salience on situational regulatory focus, i.e. the adoption of an approach versus avoidance strategy and the preferences for promotion versus prevention products. In this perspective, an experimentation has been conducted among 360 individuals from two distinct age classes (40-59 and 60-79). The results confirm the existence of two independent processes (approach vs. avoidance), so that the mortality salience manipulation leads to the adoption of a specific strategy and distinct product preferences. They also show the main moderator role of chronological age in this process, that can be mainly explained by the aging process."
"This research contributes to the problem of economic and accounting valuation of the assets reserves and resources in the extractive industry. It aims to answer the following question: What are the economic values of reserves and resources that are recognized by corporate accounting and what are, in cas of a choice between several types of values, the reasons for these choices? It shows in the first part there is only partial matching between economic values and accounting values that favors neoclassical economic theory. It shows, in the second part, that different accounting methods coexist in the six countries studied, taking int consideration the interests of majors and juniors companies in this industry. The third part of the thesis analyzes the IASB's standard-setting process and underlines the influence of the majors power and the indirect influence of the juniors. This thesis is a continuation of research in critical accounting."
"This PhD dissertation presents the analysis of the link between the government debt market, sovereign risk, financial stability and development of the local currency debt in emerging economies. The reserch contribution to the academic literature lies in the empirical analysis of capital flows in bond markets and, for this purpose, I constructed a novel database covering domestic and foreign holdings of government bonds in developed and emerging economies. As a result, this disertation projects a complete and coherent image of the globalisation of sovereign bond markets."
"The objective of this thesis is to study the mechanisms by which an expert, who is appointed by the judge or by aparty to search evidence, may contribute to increase the quality of the judicial decision-making. We use two criteriato study how the use of experts may benefit to the judicial decision-making : the cost of expertise and the cost oferrors due to incorrect decisions by the judge. Our work is divided into four chapters.Firstly, we study the judicial expert’s incentives and we highlight the existence of moral hazard and adverse selectionproblems in the relationship between the judge and the expert. Secondly, we offer a comparative view of two differentcategories of procedure in which experts may be appointed : the inquisitorial procedure and the adversarial procedure.Thirdly, we study more specifically the relationship between the judge and the expert, when the judge exerts a controleffort and the expert exerts a research effort. Finally, we highlight the consequences of potential conflicts of interestsfrom the expert, or the consequences of a bias in the methodology used to conduct the expertise. Such conflicts ofinterests or bias may create some errors in the decision-making. In this context, we investigate how the presence ofan appeal mechanism may reduce the adverse effects of a potential bias in the results of the expertise."
"I position my doctoral thesis in the broad field of organization science; it stands within the domains of business ethics, sustainability, and corporate responsibility. I appreciate the emergence of a globalized world whereby countries, people, and businesses are connected to each other through economic, political, social, and technological ties. The globalized economies and societies pose complex and multifaceted challenges. To cope with these challenges, businesses will have to assume newer responsibilities and roles. These responsibilities originate from the evolving societal expectations about businesses and their duties. Hence social discourse on business responsibility should highlight the emerging societal expectations. Further, within businesses, the responsibility discourse should give an insight to the reaction of businesses to these emerging responsibilities. And, finally these discourses should affect the consumers’ cognitive development, and consequently impact their attitudes and behaviors. The challenges of sustainability and corporate responsibility are complex, conflicting and at times contradictory. It is imperative to bank on our ability to communicate, to discuss and to co-create universally applicable rules. Therefore I adopt a discursive approach in my thesis, and use Habermas’ theory of communicative action (1981) as an overarching theoretical framework. The thesis contains three research studies, each focusing on one aspect of responsibility, thus covering the three levels of responsibility discourse: societal, corporate and individual. The first article presents a thematic analysis of the business responsibility discourse in popular CSR and sustainability books. Content analyses is used to elicit the apparent and latent responsibility themes of the sample books. The second article focuses on the patterns of social disclosure among large French corporations. The responsibility discourse is analyzed through content analyses of the annual reports of CAC-40 companies. The last article is aimed to comprehend the adoption of ethically conscious behaviors by the consumers. The article first presents a quantitative model of consumers’ ethical decision making and then validates it empirically by structural equation modeling."
"Willing to turn a tremendous item of expenditure into a real organizational resource, organizations usually perceive their spaces as potential management tools, but from conceived spaces to lived ones, a noticeable gap is often to be found. This thesis aims at understanding what an organizational space can reveal about the ongoing management practices: what can we understand from the way space is organized, beyond official discourses? Our research is focused on a case: an international bank's headquarter, from its original architectural project document (written in 1989) to 2014, that is to say: six years of construction (as the towers were delivered in 1995) and nineteen years of spatial practice. This is particularly interesting for those towers were supposed to help implement a ""New Model Worker"" through a particular spatial setting, favorable to informal communication. From our collected data, we've been able to build up a fresh perspective - an analysis grid gathering space, place, and artefacts - to better understand organizational spaces."
"This thesis is an evaluation of the overall technical and economic mitigation potential in China agriculture and the conditions of putting a carbon price in this sector. The research scope is cropland emissions and particularly those related to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use. The thesis is articulated around the construction of a bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) which offers a rational framework for combining biophysical and economic data to reflect mitigation costs. This tool allows the aggregation of the mitigation potential arising from the application of a subset of cost-effective measures above a notional baseline level. An analysis of Chinese climate policies reveals that agriculture is nearly absent in the current national mitigation strategy. We therefore intend to assess the technical, economic and political feasibility of integrating agriculture into domestic mitigation policies. In the first place, the emissions trends and calculation methods are assessed to determine a rigorous approach to build baseline scenarios from projected business-as-usual activities to 2020. Secondly, we identify nine cropland mitigation measures, evaluate their abatement rates and future applicability beyond the baseline scenario to conclude a total feasible technical mitigation potential. The translation to the economic potential is then made by comparing the implementation costs of different mitigation options relative to conventional farming practices. The MACC results show that agriculture provides significant mitigation potential to be able to offset about one-third of baseline emissions and realisation of one-third of the potential is cost-negative for farmers. We finally examine the conditions of using economic instruments to reduce emissions at the lowest cost for the agricultural sector. Given the institutional, behaviour and socials obstacles, we strongly suggest a reform in agriculture fertilizer subsidies to send a clear political signal from central planning. Scaling-up offset projects using carbon intensity as the standardized baseline is recommended and can prepare the grounds for a possible experimental emission trading programme in agriculture. In light with the top priority of safeguarding food security in China, cases studies on regional cereal production are carried out in all these steps, including the analysis of provincial greenhouse gas intensity of production, regional abatement potential related to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use as well as implementation cost disparities in certain regions."
"This thesis deals with a subject that is sharp tourism's contribution to rural poverty reduction. Theoretically speaking we can understand that tourism in general is one of the sectors that contribute most to the economy of the country. Therefore, since we are talking about rural tourism and poverty, our work is composed of three parts. In the first part, we conduct an evaluation and attempt to define the tourism and poverty reduction after having briefly explained the history and evolution of tourism in general. We would have also address the issue of poverty in the world, especially in underdeveloped countries. The second part focuses on the fundamentals of tourism development in rural areas. It then presents the different theories of development and specificities of small rural tourism economies. We try to make a proposal on the choice of rural tourism development strategy to opt emphasis on the criteria and objectives of sustainable development. Our third part makes an empirical analysis of the role of rural tourism in poverty reduction in Casamance (Senegal). Throughout this section, we present our methodology for analyzing field, our field survey, and the results after a comprehensive analysis of the situation of poverty in the region. The results we have had, allow us to make a conclusion as far as rural tourism in poverty reduction is concerned.  However, that conclusion is also questionable."
"Family farming undeniably appears as a pillar of national food security. It represents nearly 80% of farms in sub-Saharan Africa and employs 75% of assets. In the groundnut basin, family farms generally have an average size between one and five hectares, but they face the various challenges of food security, social equity and environmental sustainability. In addition, they face structural constraints of organizational and economic order in a context of climate uncertainty. Thus, this thesis seeks to understand the strategies used by family farms toward the various risks and alternative proposals from other actors in the sector's development. It is, at once, to identify the main constraints arising farms and strategies they cause to propose additional or alternative strategies in the analysis of the risk management framework. For such an aim, we arrested the concepts of family farm, risk, vulnerability and agricultural insurance to reflect the dimensions of this subject for research. This theoretical and conceptual framework was operationalized on the field within farms, giving a voice to farm managers. Several investigations have been conducted and focused on socio-demographic, structural and technical indicators, principal risks and constraints at the farm level, the perception of agricultural insurance. It appears from this study that the main risks identified are agriculture and climate. Family farms consider access to inputs (fertilizer and seed) and farm equipment as a structural constraint in the rainfall deficit. Also, it appears a significant vulnerability in its three components at farm level Basin. This reflection shows the limits of the strategies developed by the farms to improve their resilience in the context of rained groundnut basin; and justifies the need to go to new complementary strategies. One of the tracks that we have explored is the agricultural index insurance. Its coupling to credit, as collateral to financial institutions and to provide working capital is positively appreciated by the subscribers who, up to 95%, are willing to extend the use of insurance policies."
"In information systems (IS) research, there is a solid consensus in acknowledging Henderson’s & Vankatraman’s (1993) concept and model of strategy alignment. It provides a rational technical and managerial standard for optimal choice and management of SI. Paradoxically, many IS reconfigurations are failures and entail firms to go into an escalation of commitment. Based on a critical reading of the literature built on the principles of strategy as practice, (SasP), we seek to describe the organizational dynamics behind the success or failure of such projects. Through four cases and a Delphi study, a qualitative analysis was conducted using a Grounded Theory approach. This body of data underwent coding with the assistance of the software NVivo. Through the use of translation theory, data analysis has given rise to an alternative perspective to that advocated by the traditional literature. A state of alignment is the result of the establishment of a 3-pole project stakeholder network, i.e. the managerial pole, the users’ pole and the technical pole. This network does not exist in itself; it is linked to a collective adherence of its members on the basis of the satisfaction of their individual needs through a translation process. We no longer speak of strategic alignment or IS alignment, but of the stakeholders’ alignment of interests around an IS project."
"This thesis analyses the effects of migration on the behaviors of household of origins members, when newspapers' headlines focus on tragedies related to illegal immigration. Our thesis, applied to Mali, is an in-depth analysis of external and internal migrations both very important in this country, whereas most of the studies only focus on the impact of international migration. We use data from two national large-scale surveys which were fully conducted under our control. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is a descriptive analysis of the two types of migration and highlights the characteristics of migrants. It also evaluates the transfer amounts and their contribution to the living conditions of recipient households. The next chapters resort to micro-econometric techniques which allow us to estimate the effects of migration by controlling for endogeneity problems. The second chapter examines the effects of the two types of migration on schooling of children from households of origins, namely their schooling success. In the third chapter, we evaluate the impact of migrations on agricultural production. We test the hypothesis of an opportunistic behavior because of the existence of an implicit contract between migrants and members of the household of origin. Insertion of return migrants in the labour market is investigated in the fourth chapter. The thesis shows negative impacts of internal and foreign migrations, especially, on the behavior of original household members. Migrations reveal an opportunistic behavior marked by least effort at school (from children's side) and from agricultural workers. In addition, migration experience does not have significant influence on the insertion in the labour market."
"Despite of the increasing importance and the high frequency of the action of recommending websites, marketing has not specified reasons for which a person recommends a website more than others, and the determinants of this behavior. Based on an interdisciplinary literature including Marketing, Information Systems and Knowledge Management, this thesis presents a model of website recommending behaviors. The proposed model has been validated on a sample of 776 Vietnamese web users. The results highlight the impact of utilitarian and hedonistic benefits of the website for interlocutors on the transmitter’s decision and behavior."
"An intense will to influence its environment can be noted particularly in the multinational consulting firms’ sector. These companies try hard to dominate high competitive markets by imposing their new practices. They generalize new managerial doctrines which dismantle the legitimacy of the established practices and require using adapted devices, in other words, theirs. This thesis examines these operations of orientation and proposes a discursive model able to enhance the diffusion of a management practice. The neo-institutional and fashion management theories highlight the fact that managers adopt a practice according to “technico-economic” but also “sociopsychological”criteria. Our model is based on these both adoption motives. It suggests introducing a practice as simple and efficient in order to meet the managers’ “technicoeconomic” needs, but also as modern and rational in order to meet their “sociopsychological” expectations. An empirical test shows this discursive approach brings 85% of the managers interviewed to adopt the FRE model, a fictitious practice with major defects easily recognizable. "
"For the last decade, Web 2.0 tools have entered the corporate sphere and are considered as part of a major technical and managerial shift. However, there is still a lack of theoretical framework to define the collaborative regimes that the new objects of Social Software carry. In this dissertation, we explore the dimensions through which Social Software objects offer a renewal of collaborative regimes. First, we highlight the technical and paradigmatic evolutions between Groupware and Social Software. Then we carry an empirical exploration of the field of Social Software, by analyzing publishers' commercial discourse and presenting four devices that we describe through the taxonomical frameworks of Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Enterprise 2.0. This analysis is supplemented by the modelization of the four devices' evolution paths, relying on a conceptual framework that focuses on the technical object. Finally, we suggest a novel framework to define the collaboration regimes proposed by Social Software devices. This research leads us to further discuss the links between technology and the management of collaboration."
"This thesis intends to highlight, thanks to a longitudinal study, a double paradox between union, management and environment. The process that has enabled unions and more precisely confederations to gain legitimacy about environmental issues since the 1970's was reconstructed based on trade-union archives. In reply to the absurdities of society and owing to the responsibility for the employees they defend, confederations set up union environmental policies. These policies, despite being irregular, are a support to activist actions to protect jobs, working conditions (health, safety) and personal life conditions of workers. Their expertise, partly outshined by other powerful actors, allows them to often be proactive with institutional decision-makers especially in order to have a legal framework favourable to a dialogue concerning the environment. That's how they participated in the creation of the first sustainable development report in 2001. Beyond the construction of a union history, this thesis contributes to the definition of the concept of participation in management and environmental management (Richard, 2012)."
"This thesis aims at deepening the analysis of the effects of financial constraints on international trade performances, with a focus on the BRICS countries, notably Brazil. This thesis includes three chapters. The first chapter aims at evaluating the level of financial vulnerability of Brazilian manufacturing sectors in the 2000s, based on the work of Rajan and Zingales (1998). This chapter stresses the importance of the financial development and of public credits in causing the inter-sectoral capital misallocation. The second chapter focuses on the link between financial constraints and the performances of Brazilian exporters, in a framework of heterogeneous firms as in Manova (2013). Specifically, I revisit the link between firm size and firm exports by focusing on the financial constraints at sector-level. Findings emphasize the importance of problems of access to credit in Brazil, in explaining Brazilian firms’ export performances. The third chapter analyzes the effects of financial development in exporting countries on their exports to BRICS countries, with a focus on the recent financial crisis effects. Results confirm the role of financial development as a source of comparative advantage in sectors with high reliance on external finance. The positive effect related to financial development is lessened during the crisis. This confirms the importance of the trade finance transmission channel of the crisis."
"In this thesis, we acknoledge that the performance of emergency patients flow could be highered. We propose to explore an original function of management tools. Indeed particularly in the public sector, management tools are mainly used to conform the organizations to the representation of a central deciding actor, disconnected from the field, which leads to a low degree of freedom of local workers. We use tools from lean and supply-chain managements respectively in a stroke care chain and a local emergency care chain to prove that management tools can ""generate"" more performing alternative organizations. This thesis proposes two kinds of findings. Firstly on the opening of the functions of management tools. Secondly on emergency healtcare supply chains, for which specificities compared to classical healthcare supply chains imply original management rules and functions."
"In this dissertation, we propose a reading grid of interactions within social networking sites, which is rooted in the theory of the gift developed by Marcel Mauss. This lighting allows us to conceptualize the “virtual social tie” which explains the continuance of usage of these online platforms. It also leads us to develop a taxonomy of social networking sites’ users based on their behavior as “donors” and “receivers” on these websites. Thus, we have identified four groups which are: “connected” and “network-aholics” (category of continuers) then “disenchanted” and “disconnected” (category of discontinuers). We follow here a mix-method research approach as we adopt both quantitative and qualitative methods so as to get data and be able to answer to our research question"
"This dissertation aims at better understanding the determinants of individual health status. It focuses both on determinants of health investments and external factors impacting directly the health status. Chapter 2 focuses on determinants of the demand for prevention among elderly. During last years, the Retirement Insurance has increased prevention supply, in particular for housing adaptation but the take-up for the program still remains very low. We implement a large field experiment with several incentives in order to determine the nature of demand-side barriers for prevention. We provide evidence that providing information is the main fruitful policy avenue. Chapter 3 evaluates the impact of an information campaign on health demand in Mali. The campaign did not take place in all Malian health districts at the same time and was therefore realized in three waves. We exploit these temporal exogenous variations in order to evaluate the impact of the campaign on health demand. We find that providing information has a strong impact on assisted childbirth and prenatal care rates. Chapter 4 points out that the working environment could lead to large consequences on the health status, in particular on the psychological dimension. We overcome methodological problems linked to endogeneity issues by exploiting the exogenous change of the European legislation that aimed at increasing competition in the energy market. We use unique panel data on workers and provide evidence that organizational changes caused a deterioration of the workers' health outcomes. "
"The purpose of this thesis is to identify practices of fiscal management within corporate groups in Tunisia to assess the impact of these practices on fiscal performance of these major players in the Tunisian economy. Thus, the first chapter is devoted to the definition of the concept of group of companies in Tunisia highlighting their economic weight and emphasizing their legal reality. The second chapter focuses on the identification of different fiscal management practices that use these groups through an analysis of fiscal jurisprudence represented by 17 judgments of the Court of Cassation from 2005 to 2011. A survey conducted among managers of parent companies listed on the TSE is also mobilized during this chapter to sound the reasons for the non-application of the tax consolidation regime however supposed to be an effective tax planning tool. The third chapter introduces the theory of transaction costs that seems adequate to detect the relationship between fiscal management practices and fiscal performance. This relationship is developed through three research hypotheses that are forecasting the type of correlation between intra-group transactions, intra-group debt and financial relief on one side, and the effective tax rate on the other (respectively H1, H2 et H3). These hypotheses are tested in a fourth and last chapter through a multivariate statistical analysis conducted on financial data from a sample of 36 groups of companies (21 non-financial groups and 15 financial companies), whose parent company is listed on the TSE over a period from 2007 to 2011. So this statistical analysis led to confirm two of the three research hypotheses (H1 and H3) in the whole sample and in the financial sector and a single hypothesis in the non-financial sector (H3). It was then found that Tunisian groups of companies operate mainly through two practices to reduce their effective tax rate: financial relief and intra-group transactions practices (this last practice has been verified only in the financial sector)."
"The problem of the thesis is based on the study of the nature and the role of the institutions in the process of economic and industrial development in Algeria. The theses is founded on an institutional analysis inspired by Mushtaq Khan (2009). The economic development would be conditional by the convergence between orientation of the distribution of rents by the state, and polotical interests of the coalition in power. The thesis explores from 1830 and nowadays the convenient periods or not in the industrial development and looks for the political obstacles and the captation of unproductive rents."
"Investments by funds in the equity of non listed companies represent a crucial activity of capitalism of the 21st Century. This thesis provides a thorough study on the development and the characteristics of private equity funds operating in China. It applies the framework of institutional analysis and follows the logic of the varieties of capitalism while using a multi-disciplinary approach. We develop a comparative study on Chinese, French and British private equity funds based on the institutional differences among the economic models of the three countries. Our analysis suggests that the specificity of the economic development of China is mainly related to the role of the Chinese state, the importance of guanxi in the sphere of business and the great market complexity created by the “path of dependence”. Accordingly, for private equity in China we observe a stronger influence of the Chinese state, an extensive impact of guanxi, a more diverse use of information sources, a more limited choice of financial tools, and the preference of Chinese entrepreneurs to keep control of their firms. Our econometric study indicates that the rigidity of labor market, economic openness and taxation on company profits have the greatest impact on the activity of the funds and that in comparison with France, the UK and the US, China has stronger coefficients for the factors of GDP growth, household consumption growth, political stability and infrastructure."
"Although horizontal equity is considered a universal guiding principle in socialized health systems, most of the countries where such systems are implemented show social inequalities in health care services consumption.This thesis brings together four studies. It aims at contributing to the analyses of health system reforms regarding equity in access to health care services.The introduction provides a description of social inequalities in health care services consumption in France as well as of the main mechanisms which, inside the French health system, can give rise to these inequalities.In the first chapter we study the links between financial barriers in accessing healthcare and health status. We show that unmet needs for financial reasons are associated with worse future health status.The second chapter proposes an analysis of the doctor-patient interaction and how it can affects inequalities in health care consumption. We first study the categorizations operated by the doctors about their patients according to the patients’ socioeconomic status. We then study how these categorizations interact with observed practices patterns.The third chapter brings together two analyses of the “preferred doctor reform”. A first study analyses the reform and its context, with a focus on the role of the stakeholders. A second study investigates the consequences of the reform on financial access to specialist care."
"The dominant narrative of the collapsing of space due to ICT in organizations is challenged by this study. It is argued that this is due to a general lack of interest in organizational space in IS scholarship combined with technological determinism. This study seeks to understand the relationship between ICT and organizational space by mobilizing affordance theory based on J.J. Gibson’s work. A qualitative multiple-case study covering two business schools, in Canada and the UK, was undertaken. The spatial practices of academics were scrutinized using a model based on affordance theory to ascertain the role of ICT, as part of the wider environment, in the shaping of these practices. The results clearly demonstrate the inadequacy of affordance theory for the study of ICT in general. An alternative perspective based on the phenomenology of perception of Merleau-Ponty is proposed and successfully tested against the data. This alternative perspective suggests that, based on the experience of academics, ICT simultaneously collapses and expands space. ICT acts as a point of singularity where proximate and remote spaces converge to produce a singular sphere of experience. The study further develops Merleau-Ponty’s concepts of intentionality, body schema, habitus, knowing body, and habitual body in the context of the spatial practices of academics. I propose abandoning affordance theory in favour of an experiential approach to understand the relationship between organizational space and ICT."
"The increasingly competitive and uncertain economic environment requires firms to show caution and to anticipate their needs. Based on this observation, this thesis discusses several topics that are closely related to corporate cash management choices. The first chapter of this thesis show that offering an optional stock dividend enables firms to temporarily reduce cash outflows to shareholders without being penalized by the market. This peculiar type of payout then allows firms to maintain their levels of liquidity and flexibility during economic downturns. The second chapter focuses on the link between customer risk and corporate liquidity management choices. High customer risk then appears to firms holding higher cash reserves compared to credit lines. Finally, the third chapter highlights the benefits of maintaining long-term buyer-supplier relationships. These partnerships then arises as sources of increased operating efficiency and profitability for firms."
"After a summary of the main achievements in microfinance, the thesis provides an overview of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in developing countries between 2000 and 2009. A thorough study of microfinance in sub-Saharan Africa is also proposed. It serves as a prelude to the econometric analysis of the determinants of financial and social performances of MFIs and to the review of the trade-offs between the two objectives in this region. The model is also estimated with data from Latin America and the Caribbean to test, amongst others, its spatial robustness. The results show that despite their strong growth, MFIs remain fragile because of arrears and low profitability. In addition, there is no universal model of microfinance without regional specificities. The commercialization of the sector is called into question because although it does not necessarily lead to social mission drift, it does notimprove financial performance. Finally, the richness of the sector comes from itssegmentation while its weakness is due to its lack of organization, with competition leading to increasing risk rather than product diversification."
"The thesis is focused on urban growth control challenge through the Compact City model and its key spatial characteristic: the density. This work deals both with a theoretical, methodological and empirical approach. First, we place ourselves in the theoretical framework of Urban Economic addressing agents’ location choices. We mobilize these theories to identify the key determinants of residential location (employment center, spatial amenities, housing’s service) and analyze the spatial organization that follows (dense or spread). This literature leads us to consider different types of density: structural density, population density and social density. This thesis highlights various methodological challenges associated with the treatment and analysis of urban densities and proposes a more accurate measure of the intensity of space occupancy, the net density ratio. To illustrate this results, we realize two empirical studies on the agglomeration of Grand Dijon. The first is a typology on Dijon urban area neighborhoods that links density levels to theoretical determinants of residential location. The second empirical study implements the method of hedonic prices applied to housing. Relying on the methods and tools of spatial econometrics, we estimate the valuation of the density on the Grand Dijon and identify the conditions for its acceptance by individuals. This thesis sheds light on the conditions of realization and acceptance of current planning policies aiming at achieving Compact City."
"The success of relationship marketing depends on individual preferences, knowing that clients are not all equally receptive to relational approaches. It appears necessary for this purpose to improve knowledge about client’s expected relational benefits. Within a sequential mixed design, non-directive interviews conducted with wealth management clients, then with retail bank clients, show and confirm the existence of three distinct types of relational profiles : transactional, psychological relational and socio-valuable relational. A matrix combining the money attitude and the banker stereotype reveals desirable vs undesirable hybrid profiles. The quantitative study creates a scale to measure the banker stereotype, enriches the money attitude scale with the taboo dimension, and produces a scale for the expected relational benefits. The test of hypotheses in a structural equations model shows the role of the banker stereotype, the money attitude, the cultural values and critical incidents, in the formation of expected relational benefits"
"Workplace well-being and malaise are current concepts that overlap many models and theories from various disciplines and epistemologies. The relevance of these models can be questioned in order to understand the relationship to work of intellectual professions, of expertise activities or knowledge workers.Starting from a synthesis of existing literature on these topics, this thesis studies the relationship to work for natural sciences laboratory occupations. This work is a qualitative, comprehensive and interpretative approach, based on a Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA) four laboratories embedded and cross-cases studies.This research shows that different statuses present in the laboratories share the same commitment and well-being drivers but have different malaise factors. In addition, they all have some kind of “ambiguous relationship with work”, simultaneous combination of well-being and malaise, which requires to rethink the relationship between well-being and malaise at work."
"In liberalised power markets the inability of consumers to adapt their demand in accordance to wholesale prices is increasingly challenged. Nowadays technical progress within the smart grid industry constitutes promising changes for the integration of end-users into the power system, but the deployment of Demand Response (DR) still faces the challenge of its economic viability.  	This thesis aims to assess the economic value of DR. We rely on an energy-only market model under uncertainty in order to quantify the revenues of DR aggregators, classified by category of consumers and end-uses of electricity. The model is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic linear problem and solved by Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming.	It appears that in France, industrial load-shedding and load-shifting of cement, paper, and pulp are profitable. For residential and tertiary consumers, load-shifting of electric heating is not profitable. We also show that the capacity value of DR is crucial. Overall, results show that DR is beginning to become economically attractive, but that fixed costs of smart grid technologies still need to come down further to fully develop its potential."
"Credit rating agencies have recently been under a lot of scrutiny. Their responsibility in the last financial crisis has been questioned.  They received much attention from the media. The credit rating agencies have been blamed for their too generous ratings before the crisis and also for being too severe during the European debt crisis.  In this thesis, after an overlook of the recent literature, I look at two specific issues related to their activity: •	What issues arise when public information is released by a private entity on financial markets? •	Can reputation explains why a credit rating agency can be caught underrating (respectively overrating)"
"This thesis follows a dual objective. First, it aims to summarize previous evidence on the magnitude and channels underpinning a non-financial firm’s operating exposure, i.e. the extent to which currency fluctuations can alter a company's future operating cash flow, and to provide new highlights on the heterogeneity of this exposure across firms. Second, this thesis investigates the product and production strategies that are appropriate for coping with the economic consequences of exchange rate changes on firms’ operating profits. Since the range of these strategies is large, it focuses on providing theoretical and empirical evidence for the strategy of up-market positioning."
"My PhD dissertation studies Ralph G. Hawtrey’s, Harry D. White’s and Robert Triffin’s monetary thought and works between 1919 and 1960. Actively participating to key institutions which shaped the international monetary system – the British Treasury for Hawtrey, the US Treasury for White and the Fed and the IMF in the case of Triffin – those economists influenced the course of monetary theory and history. They both wrote on the non-automatic and asymmetric nature of the balance of payments adjustment mechanism, and formulated an original critic towards the classical Ricardian gold standard theory. Structured around the rejection of this classical theory, the authors’ analysis pointed out the weaknesses of the international monetary system. Since then, all of their reform proposals were grounded on the strengthening of monetary cooperation under a fixed exchange rates system."
"Our research explores the comparative development of neuromarketing between the United States and France. We start by analyzing the literature on neuromarketing. We use as theoretical and methodological framework the Actor Network Theory (ANT) (in the wake of the work of Bruno Latour and Michel Callon). We show how “human and non-human” entities (“actants”): actor-network, traces (publications) and controversies form the pillars of a new discipline such as the neuromarketing. Our hybrid approach “qualitative-quantitative” allows us to build an applied methodology of the ANT: bibliometric analysis (Publish Or Perish), text mining, clustering and semantic analysis of the scientific literature and web of the neuromarketing. From these results, we build data visualizations, mapping of network graphs (Gephi) that reveal the interrelations and associations between actors, traces and controversies about neuromarketing."
"This thesis analyzes the different aspects of the cotton sector in Mali based on its strengths and limitations through a theoretical approach, applied and field. This sector is the result of a long process that began in the early 20th century. Successive governments after the country’s sovereignty in 1960 reserved a special place in the development of activities directly or indirectly related to cotton. The goal was and is to ensure the country’s participation in international trade through a product for which the economy has positive externalities in terms of foreign exchange earnings and job creation.Our research has allowed us to identify the strengths of the country that actors must improve and endogenous challenges they face, in order to sustain the development of this sector called ""space maker"" in the heart of an economy still largely dominated by agriculture. The relevance of specialization in cotton production has proven through an econometric model ""panel data"", which allows to take into account the temporal and spatial structures of cotton production in the country by returning in the regional context of West African countries. The results of the various estimates classify Mali in good position (leader, co-leader or second).This result should reinforce the actors of cotton (states, Malian Textile Development Com¬pany, Producers) and technical and financial partners to do more to improve the competitiveness of the sector, despite the country is experiencing ""price taker"" in an environment where some major economies (USA, China, Spain) produce the same product, using sometimes questionable means, that penalize the situation of producers in non-developed countries.The crisis that hit the industry in the 2000s has replaced cotton by gold as the first export earnings (INSTAT - Mali 2012, Mainguy et al., 2013). Is this a sufficient argument for abandoning the cotton industry? We do not believe it after seeing during our three field surveys its dynamism and its impact on other sectors. In addition, the impact of cotton production on improving socio¬economic conditions of the population remains essential so that, despite its challenges, it remains a major driver of the country’s economic growth."
"Clusters are a dynamic collective space. Therefore, understanding the integration of organizations within this system is strategic. This research focuses on logic then insert the actors in the “pôles”. Mobilized the methodology is based on the qualitative study of two cases: the “pôle” PASS and Mer based in the PACA region. Three levels of results are available. The first level concerns the identification of resources sought by the players when they enter in the pin, then a second level, capture both the intensity of ties mobilized by the actors during their insertion. Finally, drawing on the resources sought and inter-organizational linkages mobilized by different actors, a third level of results allows us to identify three logical integration: technological, economic and political."
"In 2003, the promulgation of the financial security act (LSF) has changed the institutional architecture and audit practice in France. Through the addition of new rules imposed by this act to the persistent specificities since 1966 as the joint audit and tenure of six years, the audit market shows unique. This research examines the impact of this regulatory merger on the quality and the cost of the audit in France. Based on a sample composed by 888 observations of the SBF 250 over the 2005-2010, we found the contribution of rotation audit partners in restricting managerial discretion. Besides its advantage in promoting audit quality, this device supports the negotiation of lower audit fees. We also emphasized the evolution in the parabolic form of the discretionary accruals over tenure. Indeed, the audit quality is lower during the first and last phase of the engagement. This assumption refers to strengthening the skills over time and erosion of critical appraisal at the end of audit tenure. The shift from regulatory fusion helps to maintain the level of high quality on the French market. The combination of the two teams with different listener-audited tenures is a constraint to managerial discretion. However, this shift should not be excessive to limit the oldest’ domination. This drawback of the system of joint audits is limited in the French market. Our results confirm its effectiveness, mainly in the case of two Big 4."

"This thesis explores a particular phenomenon and tests the influence of consumer’s and situation’s characteristics on the decisional process applied to the choice of a novel in the retail shop. To address our problematic, we suggest a typology of the decisional processes that can be used while choosing a novel. These processes refer to different consumption phenomena: procrastination, loyalty, inertia, browsing, pre-purchase researches, mental mechanisms of decision making, influence of the packaging. We determine the variables that can affect these processes thanks to an empirical study based on bivariate and multivariate analyzes. This thesis allows us to investigate the editorial sector and enriches the researches on the situational factors by integrating all the situational variables indentified by Russell Belk. "
"The operations of banks have profundly changed in recent years, due to financial liberalization and technological innovations. The development of new financial instruments and globalization of capital markets has generated new risks and forced supervisors to changing regulatory requirements to ensure the resilience of the financial system. With the entry into force in December 2006 of the reform of Basel II, banks have had to adapt their tools for selecting and measuring credit risk and taking into account operational risks in computing requirements equity. This thesis focuses on the passage of agreements Basel I to Basel II and explains the development of prudential based reform. The shift between the ratio Cooke and the ratio Mac Donough, is presented and analyzed to illustrate the ""rise"" of the self and demonstrate that internal control emerged as the cornerstone of the new device. A study of the internal control in force in France, particulary via regulation No. 97-02 modified of Comittee on Banking and Financial Regulation, is conducted. Then, from a qualitative study conducted in a french cooperative bank, we offer guides to key controls, in terms of governance and by type of risk. "
"The first part explores the efficiency of banking institutions in the North and sub-Saharan Africa. From the observation of many years of banking crises 1980 and 1990 which led to high reorganization costs for many countries, a study of banks efficiency was undertaken which takes into account the macroeconomic and institutional environment. At this end, a cost function of each banking sector has been estimated by stochastic frontiers methods on panel data : a Battese and Coelli (1995) model applied to a translogarithmic function, a fixed effects and a random effects model. In contrast to other studies, macroeconomic and institutional quality control variables have been introduced to identify factors responsible for these underperformance. In the second part, we analyze a widespread problem on credit markets developing countries namely rationing credit to the private sector. Indeed, the banking sector in Africa is often regarded as being heavily influenced by the phenomena of rationing credit which is a consequence of adverse selection. The adverse selection is a situation in which lenders ie bankers, facing a high risk of default on the prevailing financial market, decide to concentrate their loans on the safest borrowers but whose profitability of projects is also lower. The credit is rationed and firms have fewer opportunities to finance their development. Using the techniques of disequilibrium econometrics (see Quandt (1978) and Pérez (1998)), we consider first the level of rationing in each of the banking sectors of the sample and using non-technical panel stationary (Pesaran and Smith (1995) and Pesaran, Shin and Smith (1999)), we create a model of long term economic growth in which we integrate our coefficient rationing. We identify by this process the channel through which this coefficient rationing affect growth. In the third part, we are studying the problem of uncertainty in stock markets in Africa. The role of the stock market is to facilitate the mobilization of savings, provide capital to firms and promote efficient investment choices. Given that efficiency of financial markets in the processing of information affects its ability allocative, and hence its contribution to economic growth, in a competitive market with very few obstacles information, the price of financial assets and portfolios tend to adjust quickly to new information regarding the investment prospects and the business environment. Conversely, in markets where information on firms performance and policies are less available, investors can have difficulty in selecting investment projects. The uncertainty which may result induce potential investors to shorten their investment horizons, or not to enter in the market until the uncertainty disappears. The objective of this part is to seek what are the real causes of the lethargy of financial markets in Sub-Saharan Africa and what are the macroeconomic indicators to improve to increase investment and economic growth. At this end, a model of financial market has been established and using the ARCH/GARCH modeling, indicators of macroeconomic uncertainty have been determined. A method of instrumental variables (GMM) is used to estimate the model and identify lessons in terms of economic policy. "
"This thesis is dedicated to the economic analysis of the process of irrigation technologies selection by farmers. The aim of the first chapter is to analyse factors affecting the diffusion of irrigation technologies in Réunion Island (France). A survey on irrigated farms combined with a review of the empirical literature allow us to sort these key factors with in three axes : farmers characteristics, farmers' adoption context characteristics and irrigation technologies characteristics. Two theoretic framework that conceptualize these key factors are the discussed : the neoclassical approach and the evolutionary approach. Finally, we identify the best model to use for each new irrigation technology studied. In the second chapter, a conceptual framework is designed to assess the impact of public incentives on the selection process of a new irrigation technology by a population of farmers. A methodology in order to estimate the parameters of diffusion is developped and applied to the diffusion of the sprinkler integral cover system in Reunion Island over the 1990-2006 period. In the third chapter, a conceptual framework is presented to evaluate the role played by the determinants of the selection process of new irrigation technologies at farm-level. A methodology in order to estimate the parameters of the probabilities to adopt a given new irrigation technology is proposed and applied to the choice of modern, water-saving irrigation technologies by farmers located in Reunion Island.

"Our thesis sheds light on the status of formal ethical statements in large france based companies. The following definition is given to an ethics document: a statement setting down corporate principles, ethics, rules of conduct, codes of practice or company philosophy. In order to collect data, we joined the 100 largest france based companies. We met corporate directors or senior human resource executives. A semi-directed interview was conducted where we requested a copy of ethics documents. We analysed the contents of these documents (fundamental dimensions, vocabulary, widety-covered topics). The main findings are as follows : large france based companies are becoming interested in formally thinking about ethics in business and drawing up ethics documents. Besides, striking differences towards corporate ethics documents point to the existence of two special approaches to institutionalize ethics. It reveals potentially divergent views among corporations as to the primary nature and purpose of a corporate ethics document: - cultural documents (in search of responsibility) providing statements about the company's aims, objectives, philosophy or values, which exclude specific guidance on employee behavior; - elaborate codes (requiring employees obedience) with detailed rules and guidelines, giving advice on behavior and conduct. This approach is an essentially anglo-saxon practice which has made its way to france via the subsidiaries of u. S. Firms. Ethics documents (ethical code, coporate credo or mission statement) utilize one of these two basic formats but they have one common point: they express corporate ethics in order to set up a homogenization process.

"Pension funds have many aspects, all interesting to be studied. We have chosen to work on their modelisation and also to present a panorama on the retirement systems and their organization worldwide. In the first part of the thesis, we analyse that the three main modes of the retirement systems, that is the redistribution mode, the capitalization mode and the retirement by subvention, although they may seem very different, can be organized simultaneously. Our view on the retirement systems is through an insurance and financial point of view and we give of course, special attention to the french system. Then, we move to how pension fund modelisations are made up to now and we give on an analysis on pension funds risks. We then, introduce the currently used modelisations that are the modelisations in an dynamic discrete-time. We illustrate with examples and we build a static-time modeling case like a particular case of the dynamic discreet-time. Concerning the static-time, we take time to study the ruin probability of the pension funds firm. In the second part of the thesis, we deal again, in a continuous time framework, with all the insurance principles and practical ways of the discrete time. But we go further by incorporating the usual insurance tools in a financial framework. The pension fund population is taken in a restriction free way. We use the feasibility condition, the insurance equilibrium and the mortality probability. We have two stochastic rates : the spot interests rate and the inflator rate. We put both the consumer price index and the fund's liability on the center of the economy by using them as numeraire, one after the other. In an incomplete market, due to the nonhedgeable dimensions of the consumer price index in one hand and the salaries in the other hand, we come to results, in some cases. Our results are consistent to the pension funds optimal allocation literature. Again, we study the ruin probability of the pension funds firms from many points of view"
"We wonder, with the NEG framework, about the empirical validityof some number of explanotory factors of the activities spatial distribution (local labour cost, competition costs, location of the final demand, the transport cost etc. ). Our results, founded by means of various simulations in a context of regional integration process within the PVD, suggest that firms seem to realize an arbitrage between agglomeration (increasing returns due to the market size effect) and dispersion (due to the weaker labour costs). We model, in particular, the advantage of the coastal regions compared with the internal regions in the trade with the rest of the world. This report is particularly true in the Mediterranean south shore which is characterized by an exessive littoral economic and demographic activity. It seems that beyond the international opening policies revealings by Krugman and Elizondo (1996), regional endowment in term of infrastrucutres of transport has certain impact on he degree and the efficiency of the spatial concentration within the PVD. The great second result of this study is that tendency in the redeployment of the activities of great urban poles towards the zones of lesser density confirms with the consideration of centrifugal forces. Indeed, this extension directly influences the production function of firms and drives to a more equal distribution of the economic activity between two regions. Therefore, the long term equilibrium possibilities are wider with the congestion costs consideration. "
"This research deals with economic policies of sustainable urban transport for travellers. The interest lies in the use of environmental economics instruments and their application to transport economics. The main aim of this work is to compare urban toll with tradable emissions permits system. The first part presents the literature and the second describes the development of microeconomic models. In the first approach, I assess the efficiency, experiments, modelling relevance of both tools, and I compare their results. The purpose of the first part is to establish if a tool is better at obtaining sustainable mobility than the other. From a theoretical point of view, no instrument is better than the other. The second part focuses on modelling. I adjust the standard traffic bottleneck model in order to better adapt the urban toll to the theme of sustainable transport. I add two extensions: the car’s environmental cost and a modal policy to encourage modal split. I then develop a new tradable emissions permits system for urban motorists. Analytical and numerical model’s results show both instruments feasibility and efficiency. Important variables in the models must be taken into account: the value of time, the fixed costs of collective transport and environmental knowledge. These variables will indeed impact on the tools’ success. "

"The goodwill is, by nature, complex since this notion encompasses two realities: the first is an economic concept – the expected present value of economic profits – the second is an accounting aggregate – the excess of the acquirer’s purchase price over the fair values of the target’s net assets. As these two concepts overlap, we clarify these notions by disaggregating the accounting goodwill between overpayment, internally generated goodwill (IGG) and external synergies. Our contribution relates to both the valuation of economic goodwill and the analysis of accounting goodwill. With regard to the first subject, we propose a new method to explain the creation and measure the value of IGG. The method is based on the idea that firm value is affected by interactions between assets used in combination to conduct business. Based on Choquet (1953) capacities, i. E. Non-additive aggregation operators, we explain the creation of IGG, and demonstrate from a sample of U. S. Listed firms that this model over-performs the traditional additive Ohlson (1995)-type model on accuracy in forecasting enterprise value. Regarding the second subject, we examine the effects on the equity cost of capital implied by goodwill impairment disclosures. We document a negative association between the relevant information disclosed and commitment to transparency, and the cost of capital. We also investigate the economic consequences of purchase price allocation disclosures (IFRS 3, FAS 141) on bid-ask spreads as well as on cumulated abnormal returns. We provide evidence that firms disclosing more about purchase price allocation reduce their bid-ask spread and investors’ valuation errors"
"Industrial organizations are changing due to the firms’ vertical disintegration. Therefore, supplier relationships’ regulation is necessary. Meanwhile, firms are incited to get involved in social and environmental issues. Business ethics tries to define common rules relative to the economic system. Thus, ethics formalization allows firms to integrate ethics in its policy. Ethical standard, as a specific tool of formalization, compromises between a responsible behaviour, a state of technique and economic constraints. Ethical standards are relevant since it represents a specific way of inter-firms regulation on the level of coordination and exchanges. Three characteristics of these standards are to be highlighted: they are heterogeneous, numerous and take part of the regulation of private sector by itself. In this context, business ethics is far from being neutral on the role the firm plays in the regulation of suppliers and sub-contractors, and more generally, in the society. Moreover, each ethical standard has it interpretation of supplier relationships. The use of these ethical standards expresses segmentation between primary and secondary suppliers. Ethical standard creates confidence for some and dependency for others. An institutional perspective confirms this segmentation by the analysis of standard constructions and their influence areas. Firms, States and international organizations intervene in the structuralization of ethical standardization’s international architecture. This architecture reveals the structural power of standardization as a means for inter-firms relationships and capitalism regulation. "
"Nowadays food traceability has become a factor of competitiveness in the agribusiness fiels and it is mandatory since January 2005. Facing multiple food crises and mass productions, the consumer, located at the end of the supply chain, feels the need for transparency. Traceability has therefore become an essential component to ensure food quality and safety, and also the reliability of food labels and labelling. It is as well important to restore consumers' trust while guaranteeing the conformity and the authenticity of food products. With the information potentially provided by food traceability, the consumer could play an active role in the construction of his own knowledge by associating external and internal information. In this doctoral work, our ambition is to analyze consumers' decision-making process and its effect on their preferences and choices of food product, with an aim to offer a better understanding of the decision-making process ; in particular through consumers' perception of food traceability. Our research questions thus relate to consumers' assimilation of information within an emotional framework which is food consumption. The succession and the complementarity of various methods used along this research, lead to an apprehension of consumer's preferences construction relating to traced food products. This enabled us to make recommendations for the actors of agribusiness field on possible ways to communicate information to consumers. "

"Burkina Faso is a Sahelian country where aridity is a constant characteristic of the natural environment. The fragile nature of ecological system means that particular care must be paid to the rational use of renewable natural resources in general and forest management in particular. The forest offers a variety goods and services. It is a source of income and food; it conditions the rainy season (a positive externality). However, the multiple and competing uses of the forest are also a source of negative externalities (bush fires, anarchical clearings, etc. ) leading to deforestation. Moreover the State, owner of classified forests, is unable to manage them efficiently. The thesis analyses credible and durable solutions to the coordination problems involved In the use of the forest. Using a survey carried out in villages bordering on the Tiogo forest (February-March 2001), I highlight the failure of the State to adequately manage forest resource, the importance of free riding phenomena and the harmful consequences of agriculture and breeding. The results show that a delegating property rights to local communities is a credible alternative to Stat management. Moreover, local institutions in the bordering villages are able to reduces harmful actions by households, while minimizing the ensuing transaction costs. A contingent valuation assessment of the value of the Tiogo forest shows that it would be possible to ask rural households to take part financially in its maintenance. "
"This thesis examines the geographical distribution of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China. The two major goal of this thesis are : 1. ) To identify the main determinants of the geographical distribution of FDI in China. 2. ) To find out how this distribution evolved as China widened its openness. Empirical studies were carried out at both the provincial and city levels. The thesis is divided into five chapters. The first chapter described China's gradual opening-up to foreign investors and the main characteristics of its inward FDI. The second chapter made a literature review of theories and models related to the location of FDI. The third chapter carried out econometric analyses on the determinants of FDI distribution. The results showed that the FDI distribution in China was mainly determined by the economic size and the geographical position of each region, as well as by the regional difference of China's preferential policies. In addition, the infrastructure and education level had also an important influence on the location choices of foreign investors. Besides, this study underscored that some Chinese regions possessed simultaneously many location advantages, while others were disadvantaged in many respects. Therefore, it suggested that the government should give stronger support to those backward regions. The fourth chapter studied the evolution of the FDI distribution in China. It showed that the provincial FDI concentration degree had fallen during 1986-2000, and that this fall was mainly due to the decrease of the within-group inequality. Besides, most of the FDI dispersion happened before 1994. The FDI concentration degree became rather stable after 1994. Finally, the fifth chapter compared the location choices of four major investing countries (regions) in China. Although most FDI was concentrated in the coastal area, this chapter underlined that different investors had different location preferences within the coastal area. "

"The aim of this thesis is to analyse the impact of Foreign Direct Investment in Centra) Africa. The author uses the gravity Model to show that Natural resources still remain the first determinant of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Centra) Africa, far ahead of the market size and the population. The structural equation model is also used to analyse the positive and negative effects of FDI on Economic growth in Central Africa. The result shows that the contribution of FDI in Cameroon was substantial, fair in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon and quite neal in Congo and Tchad. "

"The aim of this thesis is to understand the position and role of the management control function within the organisation. An analysis framework of the management control function is proposed. A review of the literature, complete with an exploratory study, leads to our considering the management control function as a staff function and as the result of the individual activity of management controllers. The dominant rationale, the centrality of the function (authority and client), and the activity of the management controllers (tasks, relationships and images) enable us to reveal the roles of the management control function. A typology is then drawn out of twelve case studies. Four ideal-types are brought to light: The partner, discrete, foolproof, and omnipotent management control functions. Contingency factors and cases illustrating a change in function are studied. This thesis shows that the management control function can fulfil diverse roles: aiding local decision-making, providing discrete surveillance, centralising power, providing internal and external legitimisation for decisions, and shaping managers.

"How do functional experts manage social issues in neoliberal organizations and what do they do to institutionalize the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy of their company? We hypothesize that the apparent conversion to CSR is a manifestation of society’s growing expectations on the biggest capitalist companies. We track the development of this new institutional logic about work safety in the construction industry. Using the Alceste software we do a content analysis of selected articles from the Moniteur du BTP trade journal since 1906. We find that the 1997-2007 period is defined by a managerial approach to organizing work safety. We draw some propositions about the activities of these functional experts while confronting historical rationalizations of bureaucratic and neoliberal organizations. We study the activities of safety managers in the subsidiaries of a construction company and define them into four main pieces: mutual adjustment with internal stakeholders, boundary spanning job to translate and diffuse of rationalizations, organization of a huge information system, and implementation of soft power. The field study reveals their critics vis-à-vis such a management model, a decoupling between communicated and real performances and the role of politics based on information control. Cultural and political dimensions of institutional work do make the link between institutions and organizational routines. We update the Corporate Social Responsiveness models and underline the limits of the neoliberal organization dealing with uncertainty. "
"The aim of this thesis was to propose a more relevant analysis of the workings of interorganisational relations between furniture manufacturers and transporters in France, by studying the practices of the employees. The choice of a communicational approach was based on a wish to go beyond traditional theoretical models and to promote a dynamic, process-orientated approach. This has made it possible to understand the central, organizing role of the conversational activity of these operators in the successful resolving of issues, as well as the essential place of symbolic tools and mediations. The workings of the concrete practices of interorganisational relations have been analyzed with particular attention to conceptualization, and by focusing our study on operators' verbal interaction within situations.

"Among essential mineral element, iron plays an important role in many biological processes. However, iron physicochemical properties leads to cellular toxicity. Iron homeostasis needs to be tightly controlled. Among the mechanisms involved in iron homeostasis, ferritins are of major importance. Ferritins are ubiquitous multimeric proteins able to store iron in a soluble and non-toxic form. My work aims at identifying molecular elements involved in sensing and signaling of iron nutrient status in plant cells by using the promoter of the ferritin encoding gene AtFer1 as the terminal target of this transduction pathway. In animals, ferritin synthesis is controlled by iron at post-transcriptional level via IRE/IRP binding where IRP1 is a cytosolic aconitase. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we have identified three IRP1 homologues, named ACO1 to –3. By reverse genetic approaches, Taken together, our results demonstrate that, in plants, the cytosolic ACO is not converted into an IRP and does not regulate iron homoeostasis. Indeed, in plants, ferritin synthesis is induced by iron excess, mainly at transcriptional level. A cis regulatory sequence (IDRS) is involved in this mechanism. By combining pharmacological and imaging approaches in an Arabidopsis cell culture system, we have identified several elements in the signal transduction pathway leading to the increase of AtFer1 transcript level after iron treatment. Nitric oxide quickly accumulates in the plastids after iron treatment. This compound acts downstream of iron and upstream of a PP2A-type phosphatase to promote an increase of AtFer1 mRNA level. A repressor acts in low iron condition and is ubiquitinated upon iron treatment and subsequently degraded through a 26 S proteasome-dependent pathway. A nuclear factor, different from the repressor, is able to bind the IDRS independently of iron status. These approaches allow us to discover another regulation mechanism occuring at the post-transcriptional level. Surprisingly, in Arabidopsis cells, iron treatment leads to rapid destabilization of AtFer1 mRNA. The increase of the degradation rate impacts strongly the half-life of ferritin transcripts. Two putative elements (DST sequences and/or antisense RNA) could be involved in this degradation mechanism of AtFer1 mRNA. This new post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism seems to be involved in the tightly control of ferritin expression in response to environmental variations. This work should contribute to understand molecular events involved in iron homeostasis in plant, therefore controlling the plant adaptation to fluctuation of environmental conditions"

"This thesis focuses on the measurement and the understanding of inequality of opportunity in health which are inequalities related to factors beyond the individual responsability, such as the individual's social background. We focus on the contribution of health-related behaviors in the construction of these inequalities. Our analysis is based on three topics: (i) the measure of the respective contribution of early-life conditions, education and lifestyles to health inequality ; (ii) the analysis of the intergenerational transmission of health-related behaviors with the example of smoking and health care habits ; (iii) the measure of cross-country differences in inequality of opportunity in health with a European perspective. Empirical analysis are conducted with both prospective data using a British cohort and retrospective data using a French study and a European study. The results emphasize the contribution of early-life conditions and education to health inequality both directly and indirectly through lifestyles."
"Business processes undergo standardization. This standardization is achieved through domination, confrontation and incorporation, means that have their origins in methods like Taylorism, reengineering or the implementation of tools such as ERP systems. Prescription and standardization of business processes, however, create problems for organizations, at the strategic, functional and operating levels. Our research attempts to uncover on one hand novel ways of standardizing processes and on the other the conditions facilitating the emergence of these new ways.Convinced that change cannot be defined any more as the imposition of an a priori model or a promulgated standard, we investigate how work practices may contribute to the creation of standards, and result in “practiced” standards.  To find solutions to the problems met with current ways of standardizing, we propose a model, which places practice at the heart of a spiral of creation of organizational knowledge. Through an action research project, we analyze the effects of the implementation of this model in two different settings, namely a public banking institute and a conglomerate of national press, requiring different conditions for change.Our findings, which differ considerably from one case to the other, highlight how the “practiced” standard emerges as a novel way of standardizing.  First, we notice that the “practiced” standard feeds on the promulgated standard to anchor business processes in the whole organization. Second, the emergence and the development of the “practiced” standard bring to light specific processes that operate in the organization, namely a process of sensemaking, the support of a structure of power parallel to the official one, and a process of organizational innovation."
"According to economic theory, health insurance raises medical care consumptions by inducing ex-post moral hazard behavior, it is to say the purchase of health care that individual value below their production cost. Nevertheless, among the economists community, some suggest that these additional consumptions may be the consequence of an increase of financial resources in case of illness due to reimbursements, reflecting a better access to health care. Understanding which of these effects dominates is a crucial issue to assess equity and efficiency of health care system. Based on three articles, this thesis aims to estimate how great the effect of complementary health insurance on health care consumptions is in France, and to understand the nature of this effect. The first article analyzes the effect of being covered by a complementary health insurance on the use of physician care, the second article assess how the CMU-C scheme affected health care consumptions of its beneficiaries, and the third article examines the effect of a supplementary health insurance contract that provides reimbursements in addition of the benefits of a basic complementary health insurance contract that covers civil servants. By focusing on complementary and supplementary health insurance, these articles offer the opportunity to study the effect of health insurance at the margin, on different populations."
"The aim of this thesis is to model the dynamics of international term structure of interest rates taking into consideration several dependence channels.Thanks to a new international Treasury yield curve database, we observe that the explained variability decision criterion, suggested by the literature, is not able to select the best combination of factors characterizing the joint dynamics of yield curves. We propose a new methodology based on the maximisation of the likelihood function of a Gaussian state-space model with common and local factors. The associated identification problem is solved in an innovative way. By estimating several sets of countries, we select two global (and three local) factors which are also useful to forecast macroeconomic variables in each considered economy.In addition, our method allows us to detect hidden factors in the international bond returns. They are not visible through a classical principal component analysis of expected bond returns but they are helpful to forecast inflation and industrial production. Keywords: International treasury yield curves, common and local factors, state-space models, EM algorithm, International bond risk premia, principal components."

The first chapter studies the effect of the recognition of directors’ expertise on growth opportunities through directors’ receipt of prestigious awards. The results show that the presence of award-winners on boards leads to better investment opportunities. The second chapter analyzes the impact of a board gender quota in France on market valuation. Before the quota, investors respond positively to female director nominations, especially on male-dominated boards. The announcement of the enactment of the law on January 27, 2011, was viewed as positive news in the stock market, which leads to the anticipation of post-quota female appointments. The third chapter focuses on the impact of the quota on the labor market for corporate directors. The evidence suggests that, by changing the director search technology used by firms, the French quota has improved the stability of director-firm matches."
"This PhD departs from the research literature that underlines the on-going debate arising in creative companies, between art/creative priorities on the one hand and economic/business interests on the other hand. We wonder how actors involved into the creative process deal with economic and rationalization constraints. Through an in-depth, qualitative study in fashion industry -interviews and ethnographic work, we investigate empirically the daily practices of creative actors. First, and notably through Michel de Certeau's work, we reveal the various tactics and arrangements that they develop towards such constraints, as a form of action that plays an important role in creative organizations. This form of action we call creative fuzziness maintains a necessary ambiguity around creative work. Second, we underline the socio-material and affective forces that inherently constitute creative practices, and how much such forces weigh in the economic negotiation. We then suggest the concept of creativity-in-action, an embodied-material and affective way of acting creative, within creative industries."
"Art has been put forward in response to the critiques of Management Education whose activities have become quite academized and where scientifically inspired approaches dominate. In my thesis, I note the homogeneity of the specialized literature which is quite focused on what the “romantic” characteristics of art can bring – art is there taken as the theoretical opposite of management. With a critical perspective, my thesis builds on a longitudinal, qualitative, inductive study of a single case to try to determine if art, used as a teaching method, creates distance with what locally dominates. The analysis indicates it is an experience of a hybrid practice, between art and management, which can resonate with the pillars of Management Education. Art entails less academism, but one remains in the domain of an organized activity that can be compatible with the current managerial values. It brings an experience of the practical, not only the romantic characteristics. It can have an effect on the means more than on the ends, so as to offer a return to a practical foundation which has been the source of Management Education before its progressive academization."
"This thesis concerns the difficulties to access dental care in the semi-regulated French market. The analysis targets the financial barrier of access to dental care and so the role and the mechanism of price setting. The first part gives the background of the French dental care delivery and shows that the profession of dental surgeons is particularly isolated in the French sanitary domain. In the second part we identify the decisive factors of the dental care access. We show that the free preventive program for the children Lov'Ur'Teeth was used only by the wealthiest and affected little the most disadvantaged households, which need it much more. The decisive impact of the social support in access to dental care is also a strong result in our second empirical study. The primary access to the dental treatment presents the main barrier of access. When people overcome this difficulty, they mostly continue the ensuing necessary treatments, that could be very expensive. Following these results, we focused in the role of the price. We showed that the more the prosthetic prices are high, the more is the renunciation for these cares. According to our works, the intensity of the competition impacts negatively the price setting, contrary to the demand's solvency. The prices between competitors are also strategic complements. That are many potential factors to be regulated to fight against the dental unmet need and the resulting social health inequalities."
"The increasing variability of electricity production in Europe, which is mainly due to the intermittent production of renewables such as wind and photovoltaic (VRE), will require significant efforts to reconcile demand and supply at all times. Thus, increasing shares of variability imply increasing amounts of system services. In addition to upgraded interconnections, demand-side management (DSM) and dispatchable backup capacity, electric energy storage (EES) technologies will have a major role to play in this context.However, due to the peculiar price formation mechanism prevailing in energy-only electricity markets, the commercial case for EES is being eroded by the very forces that create the need for its increased deployment at the system level. The private incentives of EES are thus diminishing while its social value, which is determined by the multiple system services these technologies can supply, is increasing.This thesis sets out to (1) model and assess the interplays between variability, flexibility needs and decarbonization objectives, (2) analyze the role and the value of EES technologies in view of the French official objectives by 2020, 2030 and 2050, and (3) discuss regulatory aspects, and propose a set of energy policies allowing to succeed in the energy transition and decarbonization goals."
"This thesis focuses on the study of urban segregation, ie the isolation both social and spatial of certain groups of individuals within cities. Also, to characterize groups of individuals and measure their degree of social integration, this thesis focuses on the definition and measurement of identity, defined as a person' sense of self. In the first chapter we focus on a measure of urban segregation, proposing a theoretical and empirical analysis of an index of Economic segregation on a continuous variable (the income) in France. We then are interested in a second chapter by the social integration of immigrants and children of immigrants in France where the ethnic identity of individuals is an expression of this integration. This chapter introduces an index that allows continuous measurement of ethnic identity and captures a certain distance in identity. We compare this index with other usual measures in the literature and study the socio-economic determinants of ethnic identity. Finally, in the third chapter, we focus on the effects of urban segregation in the degree of cooperation and trust of individuals. We study the potential impact of the neighborhood  residency of a person on his trust . For this, we perform an experimental study in different schools in Rennes among teenagers."
"The different EEC regions present important disparities which have shall been amplified by a structural adjustement started in the 1980's. Yet, many regional development projects have appeared since the last decade. This thesis, after evoking in an introductary part the state of the EEC regions speaks in a first descriptive part, of the technopole as a structuring instrument of the regional space. The technopolitan phenomenon can be observed through its concept, its problematics. A world cartology of the technopoles is drawn up to that effect. A systemic analysis of this phenomenon points out the technopolitan elements and their synergy. The second part - which is analytical and statistical - the technopole ; its evaluation and performance of the tool - , relates the economic effects of three european sites chosen for this work : Nancy-Brabois-Metz 2000, Karlsruhe, Turin. Apattern on in order to help on how to create a technopole allows to assess the viability of a site from the critical size it has to reach. The general conclusion underlines the future prospects of the technopole"
"This thesis studies the interactions between climate and fiscal policies, in terms of dynamic, intergenerational and sectoral effects. First, we identify the main goals encompassed by environmental tax reforms as well as the main structural conditions influencing the success of such a reform. In a second part we develop an overlapping generations model to assess the economic, intergenerational and sectoral impacts of different tax reforms in France. More precisely, our results show that taxing final energy and reducing labor taxes represents the most efficient way to combine climate and economic goals, in terms of welfare, and might lead to reaping the double-dividend. In a final chapter, this thesis focuses on the power generation sector, a major player in the energy transition. We study how different scenarios for climate and fiscal policies can impact production costs and investment decisions in this sector. If pursuing the double-dividend does not allow to reduce public debt, we show that the upward pressure on the capital cost could disadvantage investments in low-carbon technologies such as renewable technologies. On the basis of a macroeconomic approach on one hand and a sectoral approach on the other hand, this thesis illustrates the trade-off that governments may face in designing their climate policy: minimizing the economic cost or prioritizing the repayment of the public debt.

"This thesis has 8 chapters. The chapter 1 is an introduction to the issues encountered in the energy market : low frequency trading, high transaction costs, spread option pricing. The chapter 2 studies the hedging error convergence of a call option in the Bachelier model, for proportional transaction costs (Leland-Lott's model) and when the intervention frequency becomes infinite. We prove that this error is bounded by a random variable proportional to the convergence rate. However, the proof of convergence in probability requires some restrictive regularities on the sensitivities. The following chapters avoid these difficulties by studying the almost sure convergence. The chapter 3 develop new tools for the almost sure convergence. These results have many consequences on the control path by path of martingales and of their quadratic variations, as their increments between two general stopping times. These convergence results are well-known to be difficult to demonstrate without any information on the laws. Moreover, we apply these results to the almost sure minimization of the renormalized quadratic variation of the hedging error for a general payoff (multidimensional setting, Asian and Lookback option) for a broad class of trading dates. A lower bound for our criterion is found and an optimal sequence of stopping times is described, which is given by hitting times of random ellipsoids, depending only on the option gamma. The chapter 4 studies the hedging error convergence of an option with convex payoff (dimension 1) taking into account Leland-Lott's transaction costs. We decompose the error into a martingale part and a negligible part, then we minimize the quadratic variation of this martingale on a class of hitting times for Deltas satisfying some non-linear EDP on the second derivative. Moreover, we find a minimizing sequence of hitting times. Numerical tests illustrate our approach w. R. T. A series of strategies from the literature. The chapter 5 extends the chapter 3 by considering a discrete variation functional of order Y and Z for two Ito processes Y and Z; the minimization is on a broad class of stopping times. Lower bound and minimizing sequence are obtained. A numerical study on the transaction costs is done. The chapter 6 studies the Euler discretization of a multidimensional process X, controlled by a semi-martingale Y. We lessen some quadratic criterion on the error scheme over the discretization time grid. We find a lower bound and an optimal grid, independent of the observable data. The chapter 7 gives a Limit Central Theorem for the discretization of stochastic integrals on hitting times of any adapted ellipsoids. The asymptotic correlation is a consequence of sharp limits involving solutions to Dirichlet's problem. In the chapter 8, we are interested to expansion formulas for spread options in local volatility model. The originality of our approach is to keep the martingale property for the approximation and to exploit the call payoff structure. Numerical tests show the relevance of our approach"
"This thesis provide an economic analysis of the broadband market. More specifically we study the market of information and communication infrastructure. Three main issues are analyzed in this PH. D. Thesis. In the first chapter, we analyze the demand of broadband services and more particularly the inequalities in the access and the use of the Internet. We use a database of 5600 french households, and propose two econometric analyses of the digital divide. In the second chapter, we study the unbundling debates in telecommunications. First, we provide an empirical analysis of the effect of the unbundling access price on the broadband penetration. Then, we provide a theoritical model to analyze the ladder of investment concept. In the third chapter, we analyze the exclusive distribution of premium content (e. G. , premium channel) by the network operators. We provide a theoritical model in which a firm vertcially integrated is active in the network operators market and in the content distribution market. We analyze under which conditions this firm is incitate to distribute its content exclusively to its own (Internet) customers. "
"This study seeks to shed the light on the role of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) as a management tool adopted by multinational corporations in their monitoring of the headquarters/ subsidiary performance. We have opted for a deductive approach, focusing on multinational corporations whose subsidiaries are based in Morocco and which are endowed with the ERP tool. To meet this end, we have carried out both a qualitative and a quantitative study. Qualitatively, the six semi directive interviews conducted with the subsidiaries management fit in harmoniously with the items that figure in our questionnaire, submitted to 104 subsidiaries in the framework of a quantitative study. We have found out that even if subsidiaries benefit from autonomy as far as management is concerned, the headquarters still impose the strategic vision and intervene at how ERP must be implemented. Indeed, ERP acts positively on the headquarters/subsidiary relationship by rendering data even, making coordination fluid and facilitating budget control and goals follow- up. Other merits that the ERP tool offers include: time saving, ease of use, tracking, availability and easy data exchange. Nevertheless, ERP has not been fully utilized due to the difficulty of matching its features. Basically, head offices make use of ERP in evaluating financial performance, namely reporting sales and inventory management. Otherwise, it remains less operational."
"This thesis studies the changes in the organizational structure determined by the implementation of open innovation. Specifically, we consider the changes in the deep and formal structure of a firm. We study these changes in nine firms by using primary data collected through semi-structured interviews and secondary data consisting of firms’ annual reports and journal articles. Our results consist of a new definition of inbound open innovation, a proposition of a contingency model of open innovation at firm level and a deep understanding of the way open innovation impacts the firm. The definition of inbound open innovation we propose emphasizes three main aspects : the integration the openness of innovation into the firm’s formal innovation strategy and the systematic and frequent use of collaborations with various actors in the innovation process."
"In civil liability actions, the proportion of cases that are settled through conciliation remains very low in some countries. Negotiation failures lead to trials, the cost of which is high for both the state and the parties involved in litigation. in this thesis, we use a wide range of empirical tools to investigate the determinants that contribute to the success or failure of settlement between two parties involved in a legal action. We contribute to this topic through four original studies. We first investigate the rationality of players in one of the most simple bargaining games : the ultimatum game. For that purpose, we perform a metaanalysis of the three last decades of experimental research. Proposers’ choices, that do no match the theoretical equilibrium of the game, are found to be rationalegiven the observed behavior of responders. Subsequently, we perform a comparative meta-analysis of the ultimatum and the dictator game to investigate the “fairness hypothesis” according to which off ers in these two games are not significantly different. We find that the more developed a country, the more likely the “fairness hypothesis” is to be rejected. In a third place, we aim to identify the forces that shape decision-making in the pretrial conciliation phase of French labor courts. The results are twofold. First, conciliation is less likely when plaintiff s are assisted by a lawyer. Second, we find that the likelihood of settlement decreases as the amount at stake increases. Finally, through an original experiment, we empirically investigate the behavior of individuals who do not want to bargain, but are forced to do so. We show that individuals who are forced to bargain make less generous offers and are less likely to conciliate."
"My thesis entitled « Corporate governance and product market competition : three essays » is a theoretical research in industrial organization. The primary objective is to investigate how product market (competition or collusion) interacts with the top-level design of corporate governance, which concerns specifically the stakeholders' relationships and managerial incentives (static and dynamic) under imperfect information. It is mainly based on three chapters dealing with different subtopics of this theme.The first chapter examines how social concern and product market competition (Cournot vs. Bertrand) may influence the relationships (conflicting or conciliating) between main stakeholders (shareholders, consumers and employees). We consider two identical firms, both taking care of the interests of consumers in their objective functions and allowing their employees' wages be negotiated with labor unions. We show that social concern may reverse the traditional ranking between Cournot and Bertrand equilibria. Our model also shows that price competition (compared to quantity competition) can to some extent attenuate the shareholders' conflicts with both consumers and employees.The second chapter investigates how managerial incentive payment under both adverse selection and moral hazard might interact with product market competition. We consider a Cournot oligopoly market consisting of n identical managerial firms, of which the initial marginal cost is the manager's private information and his unobservable effort indirectly reduces the initial level of marginal cost. We show with this setting that the optimal incentive payment solving informational problems is not necessarily influenced by product market competition.The third chapter studies how the optimal contract between shareholder and manager (solving repeated moral hazard) may influence the stability of a cartel. We consider a cartel consisting of two identical firms, within each a risk neutral shareholder offers a menu of contracts to a risk-averse manager who may shirk in each period. The manager's unobservable effort influences the firm's marginal cost (as in chapter 2). We show in contrary with the benchmark case (under perfect information) that the degree of risk-aversion plays no longer a role upon the stability of collusion: when the managerial compensation is independent of gross profit, the implementation of the optimal long-term contract solves repeated moral hazard but also constrains the manager's discretion over the decision of market conduct (collusion, deviation, or competition)."
"In the present context, Information and Communication technologies are recognized as an inevitable element to improve business practices. Particularly in the home-care field in order to meet challenges of coordination and care continuity. However, these organizations operate in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. In view of these endogenous and exogenous disruptions, they have to react in an agile way to face risks and to ensure their resilience. The Business Continuity Management (BCM) meets these expectations. Our motivation in this research work is to define a methodological framework to implement the business continuity management within a socio -technical system as an integral part of a new approach to model driven enterprise engineering. After delivering a synthesis of related work to Business Continuity Management, a research question concerning the structuring of this knowledge has been addressed. A methodological framework for business continuity management is then suggested. It is based on (i) the definition and the design of a meta-model integrating BCM and enterprise engineering, (ii) the development of a set criticality assessment matrix to support the business impact analysis, and finally on (iii) the definition of a modeling language adapted to concepts of BCM. A case study from the home-care sector illustrates the foundation of the methodological framework."
"The research deals with the definition of the stakes and requirements involved in setting up an employers group in the cultural sector, with the specific application of recent music. After having drawn a picture of the fragmented, insecure, and lower paid part-time jobs in that sector, the research consists of two case studies in regional “recent music” networks. Firstly to observe human resources characteristics in small size organizations, who are mainly part of the non-profit sector, and secondly to identify what criteria may create a stumbling block for the implementation of an employers group. This research is of an abductive nature and includes exploratory questionnaires run on the first regional network composed of 22 structures. The second methodological step is based on 63 semistructured interviews held in the second regional network. The results are used to identify the recommendations on the conditions, both technico-economic and socio-politic criteria to be considered in the context of the establishment of a group of employers. The research’s theoretical framework, refers to the non-profit sector sociological studies, the “conventions” theory (Boltanski and Thévenot 1991), and the social regulation approach (Reynaud 1993). We hypothesize that the different governance levels in cultural non-profit organizations, as well as the various conventions and social regulations to be found in those structures, must be taken into account in order to predict the possible creation and development of an employers group.

"The objective of this dissertation is to develop the quantitative models that adopt the real options analysis for financially evaluating the entrepreneurial strategic choices. However, it does not only focus on the technical aspects (or its mathematical methodologies). The models proposed in the dissertation aim to provide the practically useful information in order for both entrepreneurs and investors to make decisions in the contractual negotiation of financing and investing in the start-ups and ventures.This dissertation consists of two parts. The first part gives the definitions of the essential concepts that shall be incorporated into the research question. Adopting the perspectives that are provided in entrepreneurial finance leads us to focus on the fair negotiations among participants in the process of decision-making, while the traditional corporate finance emphasises the principal-agent problem. Actually, the common methods, such as Discounted Cash-Flows and Internal Rate of Return, are not always suitable for implementing financial valuations in the context of entrepreneurial finance. Therefore, the research question of this dissertation can be set as follows: How should strategic choices in contract negotiation be financially evaluated?In order to deal with this problem, three particular issues are introduced in the second part. The real options analysis is utilised in all of the three issues, which is quite suitable for analysing them.The first article deals with the issue of licensing contract with bio-pharma venture. In summary, when closing a licensing contract negotiation, those in charge of the negotiation must consider many factors, such as the phases of R&D, the investment costs and the market volatility. In addition to those, the interaction of the participants of the contractual negotiation should be taken into account. For modelling this relationship, the assumption of dynamic interaction between licensor and licensee is introduced.The second article focuses on the dilution problem in the second financing round under the existence of convertible note holders. According to the simulation results, “discount” and “valuation cap” have a great impact on the equity decision-making cost. The results also show that the costs increase when the degree of discount becomes greater and the valuation cap becomes smaller. This may jeopardize the success of negotiation. Entrepreneurs should take these factors into consideration in the second financing round.The third article analyses the exit choice (acquisition or IPO), especially the “IPO valuation premium puzzle” proposed by Bayar et Chemmanur (2011). While entrepreneurs and venture capitalists prefer an IPO, acquisition can be chosen. Utilising the game theory, this contradictory phenomenon can be explained as the two Nash equilibria. In addition to financial market risks, entrepreneurs should pay attention to the relationship with venture capitalists, when they choose the exit strategy."
"This dissertation investigates the evolution of the Chief Financial Officers’ (CFO) backgrounds, roles and agencies along with the financialization process in France. By studying financialization and CFOs from an institutional perspective, it presents their reciprocal relationships since the 1980s. While the financialization process has influenced the evolution of the CFO profession, CFOs also have various repercussions on financialization. Thanks to 1,040 resumes of CFOs and 58 interviews analyzed through a multiphase mixed method, this dissertation offers both a large scale and an in-depth study of the evolution of the CFOs along with the financialization process."

"Recent years have witnessed a lack of momentum in equity markets that has driven a growing number of investors to turn to private markets, including private equity.This manuscript addresses research questions that characterize the changes that private equity is experiencing today: a search for relative liquidity, a quest for superior returns in new markets, and a stability in human capital, which remains an important vector of communication during fundraising.The first dissertation of this thesis examines the impact of the public listing of private equity vehicles on their performance and shows that exposure to liquidity induces significantly lower realized performances.The second dissertation examines the performance of private equity in emerging markets and shows that the success of these investments is related to the geographic distance and the cultural proximity between private equity firms and the investee companies.Finally, the last dissertation of this thesis examines the importance of human capital for private equity firms and shows that manager mobility deteriorates performance."
"Today, the accumulation of risks associated with factors such as increasing urbanization, climate change and variability, terrorism, animal and human epidemics or pandemics and enlarged mobility of people and goods have increased the disruptive and even destructive impact of various types of disasters. Crisis management plans are developed to better manage the crisis or even to avoid it. The purpose of this research is to develop decision aid tools to support the different phases of the crisis management plan for home health care (HHC) structures, mainly for preparation and response phases. A set of scenarios, considering the different sources of crises and the impacted business processes, with regard to their frequency and their human and material impacts, have been defined. An original approach of vulnerability analysis based on graph theory and matrix methods has been developed. The objective is to measure the impact of different crises on the HHC structure in terms of actors and exchanged flows. Based on this assessment phase we have proposed a classification of HHC actors. Different methods have been proposed for the design of mitigation strategies and countermeasures for each class of actors. The problem of access to care in the context of a scenario of massive intoxication is considered. A linear programming model has been proposed to simulate the studied scenario and evaluate its consequences. It models a foodborne infection and its medical response as part of a HHC-Hospital collaboration, in the framework of an extended white plan. The issue of access to patients' homes has been investigated in the context of a flood-like scenario. The proposed tool provides an evacuation plan for critical patients to evacuate and a home support plan for low-risk patients who will be kept at home, using clustering based on each patient's risk assessment."
"China is in the process of accelerated urbanization. The National Bureau of Statistics has reported the population of 1.3 billion at the end of year 2010, at least half of them live in the urban area. The Chinese urbanization since 1949 shows a specific model by the historical heritage of the centralized planned economy. After the economic transition of 1978, the system of residence notebooks, the hukou, which keeps the peasant population in the rural areas is gradually relaxed to allow, without changing the status, to mobilize rural workforce for serving the gigantesque construction of urban agglomeration. The movement took its real start in 1990. China has entered a new urban stage: that the megalopolization.  The object of this thesis is to understand, to analyze, through the nature and the evolution of principal Chinese megalopole, the specialty of Chinese urban model, with the institutional characteristics and the public politics, and of lighting all the diversity of real situations in the object for the urbanization and the economic development of China more stable and durable. We study to explain China’s by agglomeration economics, especially to examine the characteristics of urban grow during this recent period of strong urbanization pour understand why in China the megalopolization is taken on the metropolization. During this discussion, both theoretical and empirical, we have require in which scale the Chinese urbanization strategy can do object of comparison with others emerging countries, surtout with India who is the same grand population of China, to enrich the urban development model for the others countries in developing."
"This thesis deals with various issues related to collateral management in the context of centralized trading through central clearing houses. In the first place, we present the notions of cost of capital and funding cost for a bank, placing them in an elementary Black–Scholes framework where the payoff of a standard call is used as the exposure at default of a counterparty. It is assumed that the bank can’t perfectly hedge this call and must face with a funding cost higher than the risk free rate, hence pricing corrections of the FVA and KVA type appear in top of the Black–Scholes price. Then, we look at the different costs that a bank has to face when trading in the CCP context. To this end, we transpose the well-known XVA analysis framework from the bilateral trading world to the central clearing one. The total cost for a member trading through a CCP is thus decomposed into a CVA corresponding to the cost for the member to reimburse its contribution to the guarantee fund in the event of losses due to the defaults of other members, a MVA which is the cost of financing its initial margin and a KVA corresponding to the cost of capital put at risk by the member in the form of its contribution to the guarantee fund. Afterwards, we question the previously used regulatory assumptions, focusing on alternatives in which members would borrow their initial margin to a third party who would post the margin instead of the member himself, and this, in exchange for remuneration. We also consider a method of computing the guarantee fund and its allocation taking into account the risk of the CCP in the sense of fluctuations of its P&L over the following year, as it results from the market risk and the counterparty risk of the members. Finally, we propose the application of multivariate risk measure methodologies for the computation of margins and/or the CCP guarantee fund. We introduce a notion of systemic risk measures in the sense that they are sensitive not only to the marginal risks of the components of a financial system (for example, but not necessarily the positions of the members of a CCP) but also to the dependence of their components."
"Do the prices of financial assets reflect all previous information as well as all that is public? The efficient market hypothesis (EMH), in a semi-strong form (Fama, 1970), states that securities prices represent, at all times, their respective intrinsic values. Testing this EMH requires the use of an asset pricing model, the CAPM. However, it does not explain significant portions of the returns: the market anomalies. What to conclude? Is it a misspecified model or a valid one that, in its failures, indicates that markets are inefficient? Fama and French (1992) argue that the risk of an asset is a combination of several risk factors. Market anomalies, according to these authors, do not exist. They result from the omission of risk factors that influence the formation of the price that the beta of the market does not capture. The authors formalize a three (1993) and a five factor model (2015) to explain the completeness of the ex post returns in time series as well as in cross section. Despite their shortcomings in theoretical foundations, can ad-hoc models gain some form of legitimacy by integrating broad informational content and appearing as relevant and effective solutions for risk estimation of financial assets. From a French sample of 1,163 individual securities over the period 1990-2016 and from a European one of 12,144 stocks between 2002 and 2015, three empirical studies are done. The first interrogates the generalizability of multifactorial models at the national level and more specifically to the French market. The second study seeks to overcome the limitations of the CAPM by adding co-moments of orders three and four in the combinations of factors tested. In an axis of generalization of the CAPM, do the co-skewness and the co-kurtosis constitute an informational contribution likely to explain the market anomalies, which consequently makes the risk premiums outdated? In a third essay on the European market, we test the EMH through the extra-financial rating. This rating is a public information integrated into the prices. In this regional context, what about the ability of multifactor models to integrate a dimension of the risk associated with the extra-financial rating? We show that this rating of environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions approximates information content perceived by investors as a risk factor. Ad-hoc models show a higher explanatory power than the ex post CAPM. They succeed in integrating broad and disparate information contents not captured by the beta and find in this, a form of legitimacy for estimating the risk of financial assets."
"It is well recognized in the management control literature that control systems become more complex as the size of the company increases. The objective of this research is to question the relation between the expansion of small and medium-sized companies and their efforts to implement additional control systems. This is why a family-owned medium-sized company in a strong growth period with belated management structuring will be described and analyzed through a longitudinal field study. Many attempts to implement management control systems in this company have been tried but none of them succeeded. The failed implementation cases will be investigated in order to identify the conditions that obstruct the successful implementation of management control systems. In sum, what this research may demonstrate is that the implementation of management control systems is not a context-free process and should not be modelled in static relationships. It mainly depends on the actors (in a cognitive approach, their knowledge and their systems of representations) and the type of control in the organization. An awareness of the key-factors and the concerned actors may provide a new way of understanding the implementation of management control systems. The study makes several contributions to the literature. Furthermore, it provides the basis for the development of more complex models to extend our understanding of the process of implementing control systems and the influencing factors"
"Today the Corporate Social Responsibility can be considered as particularly relevant as far as the operational management of companies and organisations are concerned. It is indeed necessary to clarify the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility because this notion does not only concern the social aspects of organisations, and it does not apply only to companies. First of all, this concept should be applied in the decisions and practice of Strategic Management and be set up thanks to strategic engineering. Eventually, the impacts on the general performance of companies or on organisations will be assessed at three different levels: environmental, social and economical in order to measure the efficiency and the efficacy along the periods of time. We suggest a model to facilitate the implementation of Social Responsibility in the companies through a three dimensional engineering. It consists of the three main lines of the Corporate Social Responsibility and its implementation process which includes three different stages. We drew on our research on nine different preliminary fields from which we have obtained the necessary elements to develop our model of Corporate Social Responsibility strategic management. Then we have tested this model on two organisations and we carried out a three year longitudinal analysis."
"Literature on methodology reveals a serious problem related to the use of semantic differential scales to measure individuals’ global evaluations. Two types of evaluations are incorporated—in an artificial and unsuitable way—into these bipolar continuums that contain two opposing adjectives: indifferent reactions and ambivalent reactions. The distinction between these two types of evaluation is significant because they reflect different realities. While indifference corresponds to an absence of positive or negative reactions, an ambivalent evaluation is composed of both positive and negative reactions. This research demonstrates the advantages of using a new measurement tool, the Evaluative Space Grid (Larsen & al., 2009), developed in psychology research; this tool is able to capture the ambivalent component in consumers’ global evaluations. Using a mixed design method comprising five empirical studies, we demonstrate that the Evaluative Space Grid has psychometric properties that match those of semantic differential scales; however, in contrast to semantic differential scales, the ESG is capable of differentiating between indifferent reactions and ambivalent reactions. This research therefore constitutes a major methodological contribution that will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners."
"While a majority of the work focuses on the control mechanisms and the ethics around management practices, few empirical studies focus on the emergence, effectiveness or appropriateness of these mechanisms in the context in which they apply. We conducted our study on the specific case of the leather sector in Ethiopia to understand how governance mechanisms are born and what their influence on business performance is. The thesis objective is thus the identification and analysis of governance mechanisms in a specific territory by focusing on employees. If employees are an integral part of the business, their inclusion in the governance mechanisms should influence the company's performance. This raises the issue on how to qualify performance, the terms of employees’ consideration, the evaluation of its effects and their inclusion in a cultural context conceived in its historical depth."
"The objective of this doctoral thesis is to put forth the role of psychology in the fluctuations of production, redistribution and inequalities. Our work is centered on two axes : i) the importance of psychology with regards to inequalities in determining individual beliefs about the role of effort ii) the impact of beliefs on the dynamics of economic aggregates. The objective of the first chapter is to provide a literature review on the relationship between beliefs and economic events. In the second chapter, we develop a theoretical model, in which we introduce an unchanging psychological component in individual beliefs. We end at an explanation, of a psychological nature, for cross-country disparities in TFP, production, redistribution and inequalities volatilities. In the third chapter, we provide an empirical verification of the model implications."

"The aim of this thesis is to study the impact on work of the managerial turn in healthcare organizations and to identify the organizational and managerial conditions favourable to occupational health. We adopt a double entry: at a micro level through the analysis of work and at a macro level through the increasing external regulations that constrain work in healthcare organizations. We propose an approach using gift theories. We consider that working contains a part of self-giving which has to be recognized and accepted as a gift by the organization, otherwise it leads to a relationship without reciprocity that results in exhausting self-commitment. The research underlines the [ink between we[t-being at work and discussion forums. These forums allow local regulation of activity and expression of recognition. Middle managers play a central rote in leading these discussion forums. The thesis is based on two ethnographic intervention-researches. The first one takes place in a follow-up care center and the second one in a private hospital, both suffering from a managerial hyperactivity. The studies confirm that the malaise at work can be understood as a malaise of gift dynamics which need to be recognized. They show the essential rote of first fine and top managers, so that management too[s do not replace relationship and dialogue but sustain commitment and cooperation, being true recognition forums for gift.

"In the current context of extreme competition for the best young Graduates available on the market, Graduate Programmes (GP) are becoming the model of reference in the management of this population at an international level. However, these recruitment, integration, training and development programmes seem overlooked by management research. We mobilize here the strategy-as-practice (SAP) approach to explore in detail the dynamics of implementation of such a programme in a French corporate and investment bank.More concretely, we study the context of emergence of this programme and the day-to-day praxis and activities of HR practitioners in the design and implementation of this programme. We also explore the practices that constitute a GP from the SAP perspective and the benefits, limits and suitable conditions for such a programme. Doing that, we propose a sound portrayal of a key concept in Graduate management nowadays. We therefore claim the importance to be given to SAP in the study of corporate HR activities in the coming years."
"Why, during the digital era, individuals still prefer transaction operations through an estate agent? What do the Internet perspectives offer to the intermediation actors? And what are the Limits of this digital transformation?The work developed in this dissertation aim to provide answers elements to those questions to estate professionals wishing to understand better the behavior of their customers and the market today. The objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the comprehension of improving the intermediation systems, and particularly what brings buyers and sellers to use these services on the real estate French market."
"Interprofessional organizations (OIP), new actors in the Argentine’s agricultural institutional framework, were born in the context of a broader transformation of the sector where technology takes an increasingly central place. The innovative spirit manifested by the OIP raises questions about its role in the innovation process of the value chain. This thesis shows, from the study of three cases (the soybean chain OIP, the sunflower chain OIP and the rice chain OIP) that the OIP have differentiated roles in the innovation process. We have shown that differences in these roles are related to the forms of insertion of Argentine industries in global value chains and also the type of players that dominate the innovation systems of each chain. The framework combines institutionalist approaches to the coordination mechanisms of the actors in the innovation processes with a focus on critical geography, which can account for the processes that affect the development of agricultural chains."
"The goal of the thesis is to understand the link between the international rankings, the publication system, and the academics in business studies. We will study their relations by using the Giddens’ theory of structuration and the concepts of habitus and field of Bourdieu. Rankings build performance indicators are usually based on articles in international journals. Rankings criterias are internalized by institutions and influence their strategy and their evaluation system. It’s a system which is built around the publications to measure the quality of institutions. However, the academics do not have the same attitude towards the publication system. We have developed a typology to reflect this diversity of agents and their adaptation strategies towards the new institutional injunctions."
"This thesis has set a comprehensive framework to assess the relevance of financial stress tests, identifying their main drawbacks. Three robust and flexible model frameworks have been proposed to improve current practices in each of the tests’ stages. This is achieved through: (i) a semi-parametric EVT–Pair-copulas model for financial risk factors, with a specific focus on extreme values, (ii) a valuation model to assess the impact of risk factors on a financial system, through direct and indirect effects, contagion channels, and considering private and public response functions, and (iii) a Bayesian-based approach to run a systematic selection of stress scenarios for nonlinear portfolios. The presented risk model has proven to outperform commonly used specifications, hence increasing the test’s credibility. Estimated for the French banking system, the valuation model revealed the related risk profile and the main vulnerabilities. Public responses turned to be of vital interest. Finally, the Bayesian approach allows replacing the traditional subjective scenarios and including the tests’ results in quantitative risk management alongside with other conventional tools"
"This PhD dissertation examines how management accountants construct their professional identity in organization. To answer this question, we have built a conceptual framework based on the sociological french work of Dubar and based on identity regulation as organizational control. The construction of identity is the result of two transactions : a biographical transaction (individualchanges himself) and a relational transaction (individual attempts to change others’ eyes). We focused our attention on management accountants of a french organisation : Saint-Gobain. Our results lead us to discuss about the financialisation of organisations. Moreover, we offer a new vision of who business partners are."
"This paper analyzes different approaches in poverty in Senegal, relying in particular on data provided by the last two household surveys (ESPS-2-2002 and ESAM 2006) conducted by the National Agency of Statistics and Demography in partnership with the World Bank.In the analysis of monetary poverty, we reveal important differences in terms of poverty lines in regions with at extremes, Dakar 923,55 F CFA (1,40 €) and Tambacounda 515,70 FCFA (0,78€), suggesting little relevance to the use of a threshold at national level alone. On basis of these thresholds, the indices of poverty stemming from the Foster's generic formula, to Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) reveal a reduction in the rate of poverty between 2002 and 2006 from the 57.1 % to 50.8 %, that is 6.9 in the whole of country and a gap in the poverty's line passing from 18 % to 16,4 %. This decline is particularly observed in the regions of Dakar, Diourbel, Kaolack, Saint-Louis and Thies. At the departmental level, poverty rates show a significant concentration in rural areas and the existence of pockets of poverty enclaved in urban areas. The estimation of a spatial econometric model highlights the socioeconomic factors that may explain the interdepartmental differences in poverty rates observed in 2006, including the level of regional economic development (urbanization, employment) and household behavior related at infrastructure (education, health and fertility). Furthermore, we propose a dichotomous model from which it is possible to identify the determinants of income poverty of household heads. The results show that female-headed households are not the poorest layer. In general way, differences of poverty apparent between urban and rural areas are largely correlated with disabilities in terms of education and unequal access to information and communication resources.We are entering a multidimensional analysis of poverty in Senegal, through an estimate of the degree of deprivation of some basic household needs. The approach by the theory of fuzzy sets used for this purpose shows that poverty declined slightly: 1% against 7% for monetary poverty. Unlike the monetary approach, the observed decrease from non-monetary poverty affects other regions as Kolda and Ziguinchor and Kaolack and Diourbel saw an increase. The estimation of one-dimensional fuzzy indexes allowed identifying the domains in which the households post the degree of largest deprivation: the quality of housing, education and information and communication technologies, beyond income.The profiles of monetary poverty as well as multidimensional are excellent tools to target the most destitute groups of the population. However, these tools remain dumb on the perception of these poor people as for their own socioeconomic situation. In this sense, an econometric analysis of the determinants of poverty felt in Senegal in 2006 brings up the importance of certain non-economic dimensions (social exclusion, cultural and lack of consultation of stakeholders on policy development and cutter fight poverty)."
"This thesis investigates pension reforms in developing countries, their ability to provide retirees with a decent income, and the issue of extending their coverage to the entire population, including informal workers. The first two chapters assess the transition from pay-as-you-go to fully funded or multipillar schemes. A case study based on  macro-data and pension funds data from 7 Latin American countries show that such reforms had very low effect on coverage rates and labour formalization and did not succeed in protecting people from old-age poverty. The third chapter describes the Moroccan pension system and shows that the reform currently in discussion is not sufficient either to achieve this goal. The last two chapters are empirical studies based on Moroccan labour force survey and household survey data. The first one draws a complete panorama of the non-contributing share of the population and estimates the probability of informal employment depending on both individual and professional characteristics. The second one studies the economic lives of the elderly. Overall results confirm that the informal labour market is heterogeneous and that most informal jobs are involuntary, not a choice made by workers to avoid paying taxes and social security contributions. It also appears that households that include aged members are poorer, the intergenerational cohabitation is high and therefore, creating a solidarity pension will help alleviate poverty at a cost not exceeding 0.5% of GDP."
"In a context of economic, financial, social crisis through social dumping reinforced by globalization and environmental crisis by the scarcity of natural resources and pollution of the environment, the boom of sustainable development, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and extra-financial analysis should be involved in a process of creating innovations according to Schumpeter theory with the emergence of environmental technology (green tech), and new social models (Buddhist economy, base of the pyramid and social business) and environmental models (circular Economy, cradle-to-cradle and functional economy), source of competitiveness according to Michael Porter. This process of creating innovations generates a destruction of established situations according to the Schumpeterian theory. Beyond the debate on the performance of SRI funds, socially responsible investments have a varying role in the development of this new economic wave according to the management of SRI funds is active or passive. Therefore, the strengthening of the ESG analyses helps the development and enrichment of extra-financial information, as well as the promotion of a social choice, environmental and corporate governance by investors."
"To investigate on the question of the formation of the economic magnitudes, and on the question of value seems to be pointless, since those notions appear to be understood and to fall under the scope of our daily experiment. We show in the present work that several fundamental concepts and central notions do not receive a proper definition within our discipline.  As a consequence, it is all the economic discourse that is weakened, at such a point that it talks about things that, actually, do not exist, but in the economist’s mind, and do not consider its true matter. In our wage economy, value is sometimes created sometimes destructed respectively in the formation and the destruction of income. The latter is an objective magnitude in the sense that it confers to its owner the tangible ability to buy goods and services. We thus make sure that income unifies the two opposite operations that are production and consumption, and that it is the true object of the economic science. We also insure that income is a monetary by naturee, and cannot be expressed in “real” terms; value is not hidden behind things. In a second time, we see that income is measured, and that its objectivity comes from the fact that it is measured. In economics, measure is specific since the unit of measurement is monetary and by no mean physical. The operation of measurement happens in the payment of wages to the benefit of the employees. By showing that product is “born” in the same operation by which it is measured, we are leading to a strong conclusion: all income is derived from wages."
"Whilst experts have predicted the downfall of wholesaler, the latter has survived and e to environmental pressures. This thesis, consisting of three in-depth case studies, investigates into the resources mobilization underpinning wholesalers' survival. The meticulous empirical setting sheds light on the transformations impacting the wholesaling field and on local actors' specific responses. This thesis contributes to illuminate the meaning and role of resources vis-à-vis interactions with institutions. Moreover, it promotes the concept of Institutional Biography as a lens to better understand action origins. The model derived from my analyses describes and explains fruit and vegetables wholesalers’ efforts to become a guarantor for quality, despite prejudices about their inertia and predictions of their disappearance"
"The debate on the optimum level of transparency in financial markets found a major point of controversy: the ownership of public companies. The design of new financial products and the development of shareholder activism called the blockholding disclosure rules into question. This thesis analyzes the economic impact of changes in regulation, measures the value relevance of the content of blockholding announcements, and introduces a new conceptual framework allowing strategic behavior of the involved economic agents. According to our empirical results, the information disclosed by blockholders are value relevant, even when the blockholder commits to remain passive. Our theoretical model suggests that blockholders make a strategic use of the reporting window, and predicts that a shortening of the legal time period would be favorable to minority shareholders."
"Since the early days of management research, its relevance to practice has been the subject of vigorous debate. Understanding the relationship between research and practice implies studying how management knowledge is produced. We first aim at understanding the controversy surrounding the relevance of management research. We develop four complementary approaches on how academics apprehend the relationship between research and practice. Then, we develop a framework that allows the identification of four modes of interactions between scholars and practitioners and discover a developmental process that is specific to the management innovations that are developed between research and practice. Then, we study how the strategic concept of “Blue Ocean Strategy” is performed. We show how its innovators have performed the concept by applying its own principles. Finally, we are interested in scholar-practitioners given they straddle the worlds of research and practice to produce management knowledge. We seek to understand how they overcome role conflicts related to their activities in both research and practice. These four studies shed light on how management knowledge is produced."
"Regional trade agreements (RTAs) have surged in a context of stalled multilateral trade negotiations. This doctoral thesis intends to advance scientific knowledge in the field. Thus, thanks to a gravity model theoretical framework, three chapters of applied empirical econometrics analysis have been completed. The first chapter examines the effects of RTAs, the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) and World Trade Organization memberships on bilateral trade flows. I put into practice different econometric specifications and estimation methods, notably Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML), which is the one that better seems to contend with well-known biases and endogeneity problems.  I conduct this research with an international trade gravity model estimated across 153 countries from the year 1980 to 2012.I consistently found a strong positive impact of regional trade agreement RTAs on most specifications and low or non-significant results for WTO membership. The estimates from the PPML method that includes controls for unobserved heterogeneity show non-significant effects of the Generalized System of Preference (GSP) on trade.The second chapter, co-authored with my supervisor Jean-Marc Siroën, explores the effect of heterogeneity of RTAs in the scope of deep integration. We intend to determine if deeper RTAs promote trade more effectively than less ambitious agreements. We make use of two recently available data sets from the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Trade Institute (WTI-DESTA) to generate credible indicators of deep integration. Additive and Multiple Correspondence Analysis derived indicators for the depth of the agreements are then computed and their significance is tested in a gravity model. We find that deeper agreements increase trade more than shallow ones, whereas the provisions they included are within or outside of the WTO domain.The third chapter investigates the existence of trade potentials between Colombia and the EU. I obtain in-sample predictions after the estimation of a gravity model with the Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator. I control for unobserved omitted variable bias by the inclusion of exporter and importer time varying fixed effects, and run a series of sensitivity analysis.Untapped trade potentials are found between Colombia and a group of EU countries in both directions of the trade flows. Exports from Colombia have a gap to bridge with Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Sweden. In the other direction, Sweden, Ireland, Finland and Poland have an interesting margin to gain in the Colombian market."
"The main objective of this thesis is to analyse the health consequences of career shocks in Europe. It considers two actual career shocks over the lifecourse: leaving full-time education in a bad economy, and, at the other end of the age spectrum, retiring. In-between these two critical periods, it investigates how an anticipated career shock -- i.e. anticipated job loss -- damages health. Empirical analyses are conducted using large European and British surveys. We use institutional features and natural experiments to find neat instruments for causal identification~: the existence of compulsory schooling laws, the cross-country variation in employment protection legislations, the cross-country variation in retirement systems and the 1973 oil crisis. The results emphasise the causal and health-damaging impact of career shocks, both in the short and in the long-term."

"This thesis studies the consequences for innovation of international trade allowing for spatial interdependence. Indeed, the mechanisms through which international trade affects innovation are based on highlighting factors that, because they are the source of increasing returns, represent real engines of the growth. Yet, the accumulation process of these factors depends on effects which are constraints in space .First, trade flows by which technology is supposed to transmit between countries are interdependent. Second, the results highlighted in existing literature capture only the direct effect of trade on innovation. However, it is possible that a country benefits technology from an another country without any trade between the two countries. It seems convenient to revise the relation between international trade and innovation in the context of spatial interdependence. Based on endogenous growth models, we derive two spatial structural models in order to take into account spatial interdependence. The empirical analysis of spatial models revealed that in addition to traditional variables such as R&D and human capital, externalities contribute strongly to productivity growth and these externalities are especially important for low-income countries. Regarding competition, the effects are mixed. Trade liberalization, by increasing competition, promotes innovation in developped countries. However, it reduces innovation in low-income countries."
"In France an objective of dividing greenhouse gas emissions by four, from the 1990 level, by 2050 has been set. Are these ambitions out of our reach? What will the price to pay for this objective be?We have built a long-term backcasting transport demand model (TILT, Transport Issues in the Long Term). This model is centered on defined behavior types -in which the speed-GDP elasticity plays a key role- in order to determine demand estimations. This model lets us understand past tendencies -the coupling between growth and personal and freight mobility and adapt behavioral hypothesis -linked to the evolution of public policies- in order to show how a 75% reduction objective can be attained.The main results are an estimation of CO2 emissions for the transport sector taking into account technical progress and demand. These results are presented as three scenario families named: Pegasus, Chronos and Hestia. Each family corresponds to a growing degree of constraint on mobility.It is possible to divide greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector by four. Technical progress is able to lead to more than half of these reductions. The interest of these scenarios is to show that there exist different paths –through organizational change- to getting the other half of the reductions."

"This thesis aims at better understanding long-term care insurance puzzle. Three determinants of the long-term care insurance market low development are studied here: individual preferences, self-insurance and myopia. To do so, we use two surveys that have introduced dependency-specific modules: “Preferences and patrimony against time and risk” and “Health Care and Insurance”. The results highlight the role of these three determinants of long-term care insurance demand in the low development of the market. If myopia advocate for a government intervention in French citizens long-term care planning, the impact of individual preference and self-insurance behaviors suggest that the nonpurchase of long-term care policies is economically rational."
"The statistical and bibliographical sources show that the Greek Industry of the last 50 years is not a field of ruins which the recent crisis would have finished destroying. It has followed the general evolution in the world of the industrial product towards the industrial service and the immaterial or cultural forms and thereby escaped to historians sight. It holds in Greece a place similar to that hold in the European Union. Its specialization strongly increased because of its insertion in competitive spaces and because of the crisis. It occupies original spaces in Greece, which favor the evolution of the product and its distribution on the whole territory, far from the traditional opposition between Athens and the province. His Diaspora in the world helped to build aparticularly opened foreign trade.  The company is the geometrical place of the growth, as it is of the adaptation to the crisis, particularly violent since 2010. The company led the industrial restructuring, the reduction of the employment and the modification of the forms of employment, but also the recovery of the productivity and the restoration of its financial autonomy. The latter is built in a original way, based as well on the family self-financing as on the practices of delaying payments of bank and administrative debts. These corporate strategies invite to a closer observation of the entrepreneurialité in Greece, its vigour, its characteristics in terms of size, legal form and employment. They point to the role of the family and its values in the historic construction of the entrepreneurial spirit, in properties of some branches of industry, in the relation between companies and the State."
"Cities are not homogeneous territories: some neighborhoods concentrate wealth while others face difficulties such as unemployment, poverty, exclusion or crime. These fractures are a consequence of urban segregation, i.e. socioeconomic inequalities spatial pattern. To that matter, this thesis addresses three objectives: (i) the characterization and explanation of segregated urban structures appearance, (ii) the link between segregation and labor market, and eventually (iii) the link between segregation and education. According to Urban Economics, the urban structure influences individual’s employment status through the distance to jobs. This hypothesis is tested via an empirical study on the Marseille urban area. The link between segregation and education is apprehended through the educational public policies evaluations. The effects of these policies are characterized through a critical literature review and an empirical study of the role of the “Politique de la Ville” on the junior high school student’s schooling in Ile-de-France. This approach highlights the effects of job distance, neighborhoods and peer effects on individual’s employment status. This approach also shows the “Politique de la Ville” positive effect on grade retention and the nuanced effect on schooling choices. Finally, this thesis provides an explication to the existence and form of the urban segregation in France."
"At the end of 2009, the competition authorities have granted a 4th mobile license to Free, French operator already present in the fixed telephony and the Internet. The new operator not having a good coverage, he obtained permission to sign a roaming agreement with the incumbent operator Orange, enabling Free subscribers access to the network in areas not yet covered. Given its dependence on Orange, Free can be seen as a virtual mobile operator. We use a parameter that describes the level of independence of Free and can take three possible values. At first Free is an operator totally dependent on Orange. Then, a part of the traffic of Free passes by its own network. Finally, Free is an independant operator like Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom. From a comparative static analysis, we study the consequences of the granting of this license under Cournot competition. When Free is an operator totally dependent on Orange, with a low rate of access to the Orange network, its entry leads to a reduction of price and profits of some incumbent operators with an increase in consumer surplus. However the magnitude of the reduction is greater when Free becomes more independent. Stackelberg competition allows to notice better the price reduction after the entry of Free. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to highlight the importance of the inclusion of the roaming contract to analyze the effects of the entry of Free. Free had negative impacts on his competitors, in particular Bouygues Telecom. To remain in the sector, there are three possibilities of merger. The mergers with Free or SFR-Numericable are made with reduction of costs, whereas that with Orange is without synergy. The analysis of these mergers show that they are at the same time profitable and socially beneficial. Thus in this thesis, we show that any merger creates no synergy, is not necessarily anti-competitive. However a dilemma arises for Bouygues Telecom, because the merger accepted by the authorities of regulation is not the one that gives him the highest profit."
"This thesis deals with social inequalities in health-Related behaviours such as lifestyle risk factors for health (precisely, obesity and alcohol consumption) and the utilisation of health care services, in a number of OECD countries. This work relies on an applied micro-Economics approach, using several national health survey data. This thesis aims to (a) compare social inequalities in health-Related behaviours across countries with different settings; (b) shed light on the understanding of social disparities in health-Related behaviours; and (c) examine how self-Reporting may affect the rating of behavioural risk-Factors, and therefore affect the measurement of social inequalities."
"Vietnam has attained outstanding performance in education during the past two decades. However, inequality in educational opportunities aggravates disparities among children and threaten the improvement of labour productivity. The underlying mechanism for transmitting inequality and role of skills in the process remaining unclear motivates this thesis. It aims to study how skills interact with environmental factors to determine outcomes on education and livelihoods in Vietnam. Firstly, Chapter 1 examines how skills predict dropping out Then Chapter 2 inspects whether full-day schooling reduces educational inequality. Finally, Chapter 3 investigates the relative importance of skills in determining labour market outcomes. To this end, the research applies diversified quantitative approaches using data from the Young Lives in Vietnam. The contributions of the thesis are threefold, namely taking into consideration the non-cognitive skill in the analysis, addressing the interaction between social background and school environment, and the measurement errors accompanied poor proxies for skills in Vietnam. The thesis hints at further levelling educational opportunities of children and enhancement of non-cognitive skills for greater outcomes in life and economic growth"
"In the light of critical perspectives on accounting theories and practices, sustainability accounting (SA) as a relatively new discipline has emerged. Compared to various SA models developed under the mainstream neoliberal ideology, some alternative models with “stronger” capital conservation strategies, notably the “Triple Deprecation Line” (TDL) (Richard, 2012; Rambaud & Richard, 2013), seem to have a lot of potentials to make some fundamental changes. This dissertation is essentially an investigation of necessary conditions and possible resistances faced by the establishment of the TDL model. The agriculture sector of the People’s Republic of China is chosen as the field of research in order to study the institutional environment and historical context in real-world settings. The investigation on the Chinese context is conducted with reference to theories of institutionalist political economy, inspired by Karl Polanyi (2002[1944]), Mancur Olson (1965), and Chang Ha-Joon (1994, 2002)."
"This thesis analyses how the production of space helps to create and sustain alternative organizations. In this study, space is seen as a source of power. In order to answer this question we conduct a single case study: the intermediary places in the French theatre sector. Two organizational models prevail in this sector: the lucrative private sector and the public non-profit one. Intermediary places tend to establish a third model neither private nor public: third sector organizations. We combine semi-structured interviews, observations and secondary data. We show alternative organizations produce different type of individual and collective spaces on multiple scales. Thanks to this combination, intermediary places become mobile and more resistant to dominant space reactions. They are most likely to sustain themselves."
"Consumers are most of the time left at the margins of neo-institutional theory. Yet, the institutional work concept makes it possible to consider consumer practices aimed at maintaining or disrupting formerly institutionalized practices or at creating new ones. Furthermore, taking into account the practices material dimension allows us to consider how objects play a role in consumer institutional work processes. The case of the French recorded music industry from 1994 to 2014 - when MP3 downloading then streaming overcame CD consumption practices - is studied with a grounded theory inductive approach. Our dissertation shows that consumers collaborate in order to perform institutional work (maintaining, disrupting and creating institutionalized practices). To disrupt institutionalized practices, they use « bricolage » to assemble available practices and objects, among themcommunity-objects that play a specific role: sharing information and objects. Moreover, material resilience, not only contributes to practice maintenance but also to disruption and new practices institutionalization."
"In this dissertation we identify the determinants of the longevity and the probability of survival of small businesses created by young graduates benefiting from bank loans at enhanced rates. The focus is on the policy impact of public support for the creation of companies. The data are based on a survey conducted in 2013 under the tutelage of the University of Sfax (Tunisia) of a cohort of 160 companies five years after they were first formed. The response rate was 81.25%. After discussing the issue of the survival of newly-established companies and the factors that promote their survival, we use duration models specifically the Cox model (1972). This analysis allows us to shed light on a business is more likely to survive if the entrepreneur is a male who started his business within a year of graduating and comes from an entrepreneurial background, stimulating his entrepreneurial spirit. The improved longevity of small companies ensues from the similarity between the entrepreneur’s previous occupation and the activity of his own company, and from the initial start-up capital if it exceeds 30.000 DT. Aid granted by the State for new promoters (investment subsidy, grant, and reduction in social security contributions) does not help reduce the risk of entrepreneurial failure with the exception of State aid to support a portion of employees’ wages. On the other hand, a company benefiting from entrepreneurial training before creation and from support post-creation sees its probability of survival rise."
"The Communities of Practice (CP) are identified as conductive structures for learning and knowledge transfer between members of the organization. Besides practitioners in management, many researchers were interested in these groups. Some have highlighted their operational roles in organizations (Lave et Wenger 1991 ; Brown et Duguid,  1991 ; Wenger 1998 ; Smith et Farquhar 2000 ; Lesser et Stork 2001 ; Mc Dermott 2002 ; Guérin 2005 ; Schenkel et Teigland, 2008 ; Hemmasi et Csanda, 2009), and others have tried to identify their structural and epistemic characteristics (Wenger 1998 ; Chanal 2000 ; Cohendet et al., 2003 ; Blunt, 2003 ; Josserand et St Leger, 2004 ; Guérin 2005 ; Thompson 2005.).  However, the link between such communities and employee performance is seldom investi¬gated, especially in service firms. This has encouraged us to conduct our study on the relationship between CP and member’s performance in the context of service relationships and more specifically in the front office of these companies. Furthermore, our thesis is part of the Human Resource Management sciences, and we aim to  draw some lessons for HRM practices in organizations. This is an attempt to bring the concept of CP and HRM that gives a certain originality in our work. This allows us to get some current common and dominant in the field of study of CP, where contributions are often recorded mainly in the approach to Knowledge Management in organization. •  Our problemOur problem is based on the understanding and analysis of the CP's links with the  performance of its members. The CP does contribute to the performance of its members in service relationships? To develop these questions, we decided to decompose it as follows:-  Is there link between membership of an employee to a CP and its performance in the context of service relationships?-  If this link exists, how this last one is built? What are the different mechanisms by which it was constuct in service relationships?-  If this link exists, what are the lessons that may have drawn some HRM practices in organizations? •  Our Method      Following several authors’ advices, we turned in our empirical part to the case study approach. Un empirical work investigating a contemporary phenomenon in its context of real life (Yin, on 1994; Eisenhardt, on 1989 ; Baumard and Ibert, on 1998; Hoepfl, on 2007; Giordano, 2003) Our study is led in the front-office of two public organizations and in a bank (private sector). Eight units composing these devices of reception were studied : four call centers and four reception desks. Our study revealed interesting results. They have greatly enriched the knowledge in the various areas covered, as well as lessons for certain practices in organizations."
"In three parts, this thesis evaluated the results and the chances for the successful financial liberalization in MENA countries. In this research we observed that the financial repression had negative impacts on the financial development system and the economic growth. But in facts, the financial liberalization did not respect the directives of the theory of liberalization. Liberalization was entirely followed in the Middle East, but was progressively made in the North Africa. In addition, the stages of the reforms didn't not follow in a clear order. Economic stabilization was often accompanied by other reforms such as the introduction of indirect instruments of monetary control (Morocco, Tunisia) or the fast liberalization of the interest rates (Egypt, Jordan). In the same way, the banking restructuring was applied at the same time as the introduction of the supervision rules or the development of the monetary market. The imperfections observed in the reforms didn't allow to reach the results predicted at the beginning of the reforms. These results showed that there are no measures to be applied to all the countries. Economic, legal, and political situations are so different from one country to another that the success of a given policy can differ extremely. Thus, it would be more interesting in the analysis of the methods of financial reforms to focus on the individual characteristics of a country in order to explain better the choice and the change made. The effect of external factors on the success or failure of the reforms is another track to be exploited. In the same way, the domestic factors such as the change of the political regimes and/or the spending patterns, the education level exert an obvious impact. To restrict our research to the only economic factors induced by the reforms is on our point view a narrow approach analysis. The social, political and psychological factors influence also the organisation of reforms in developing countries. The explanatory elements of methodologies of the reforms within the MENA as well as the analysis of the results may lead the subject to its greater depth. "
"Thanks a longitudinal study on 39 contracts in water and sewage utility, the author draws two models describing their progress. Whereas most contracts are dominated by opportunism, the most concerned organizations negotiate every few years with the firm in charge with the utility. As there is no other way to create the appropriate incitations in such an incomplete contract, negotiation skills should be developped. Organizations are all the more interested in appropriating a part of the social surplus because they face huge investment in plants. However, transaction costs have to be compared to expected gains.

"In a context of internationalization of large retailers and increased exchanges between companies from diverse countries and cultures, the issue of mutual adjustment between local suppliers in host countries and foreign retailers is essential. This research focuses on this issue. We analyze conflict and adjustment mechanisms between retailers and suppliers in the host country, in the case of Vietnam. Our analysis outlines the determinants and consequences of conflict on the satisfaction of stakeholders, considering culture as a key variable. Four theoretical fields have been mobilized: behavioral theories in the distribution channel, contract, culture and market orientation theories. A quantitative study was conducted to test the hypothesis of our dyadic model. The results indicate that the culture organizational remains a key variable in explaining conflict, its determinants, methods of resolution and impact on stakeholders’ satisfaction. "

"The trend toward globalization seems to be stronger than event for the business community nowadays. Businesses set up new activities in foreign countries in order to gain access to new markets and to increase their sales. Although globalization is gaining in importance, many factors must be taken into account if one aspires to succeed abroad. One of those factors is national culture. National culture is the topic of this dissertation. The goal is to investigate how national culture can impact the relationship between human resources practices and organizational performances of banks in twenty-two countries of North-America, Europe and Asia. Our study looks more closely at the influence of eight dimensions linked to human resources (HR) practices (incentive income, training, recruiting, selection, employee’s performance appraisal, work organization, communication, and job security) on organizational performances (social performances, economic performances, financial performances). We were able to establish that HR practices lead to different outcomes in different countries. For instance, some HR practices can have a positive influence in France but a negative influence in Japan because of the existence of a distinct culture. In order to measure national culture, we have used Geert Hofstede (1991) framework, which identifies national culture with four dimensions, power distance, individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity, in each country"

"The aim of this thesis is to propose a connection between cost and value by promoting a dialogue between ABC model and CRM. In the first part, to reach this objective, we designed a model based on activities and process within a micronutrition firm. We have attempted to implement the ABC-CRM dialogue and tested it on the pharmacy group. We used the acquisition, retention and additional sales model borrowed from relational marketing to develop intermediate objects, support of the profit analysis, and therefore of value for the firm. The result revealed the potential of this dialogue. But, the change occurred in the organization during the research lead to the abandonment of the ABC model we have developed. A new model, also based on activities and process and generated by the reorganization occurred in 2008, succeeded to the former. The second part analyzes the impact of the accounting management change within the firm. The third part highlights the technical, organizational, human and theoretical difficulties due to the implementation of an ABC-CRM articulation project. "
"The main aim of this thesis is to analyze the new accounting system adopted in Libya from 2005. This accounting system has been set up in order to be coupled with the international reference. One of the objectives of this document is to conclude if this accounting system is compatible with the local cultural context. The second part of the thesis will expose the theoretical research, the environmental changes and its influence on the accounting of developing countries. This relation between culture and accounting system is analyzed from the model established by Hosfede and Gray (1988). Through the third part we will develop a pragmatically analysis. We developed and administer our study to 59 Libyan companies and 52 accounting experts. Thus this document analyses the Libyan cultural accounting context and to emphasize on the importance of the culture to establish the Libyan accounting system. "
"This doctoral thesis pursues three inter-related questions of research. Specifically, it tries to: a) identify the sources of tension responsible for the intensifying difficulties encountered by Germany after 1990; b) evaluate their consequences for the institutions underlying Germany’s post-war model of “social market economy” and its coherence; and c) assess the impact of institutional changes after 1990 on the structure, strategies, and specialization of industrial firms in that country. Identifying the principal forces behind the transformation of the German growth model, in particular the growing dominance of market-based finance and reunification, we have divided the dissertation into three different parts. The first part focuses on the progressive disintegration of the traditional bank-industry relation. This is followed by an evaluation of stock market developments and of changes in the ownership structure of the most actively traded companies. In the second part we study the major changes in the system of professional relations, with special emphasis on the model of reproduction and designation of principal actors. The third part constitutes the empirical verification, allowing us to measure the impact of shocks on the systemic coherence of the model and its comparative advantages. Here we analyze also how the pillars of German capitalism adapted to the constraint of shareholder value maximization, as well as the latter’s impact on their structure and industrial strategy. We then concentrate our analysis on the specialization model(s) of the export industry. We end with a discussion of the long-term viability of the model’s recent changes identified above. "
"A transition to a renewable based energy system is crucial. Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources (RES) offers the promise of a clean, sustainable energy carrier that can be produced from domestic energy resources around the globe. The production of hydrogen from renewable energy resources is not well understood. This complexity that exists comes from many facts such that related to the intermittent behaviour of renewable energy resources. The alternative fuels and energy carriers that are produced from the RES are challenging for the sustainable development of renewable energy. These systems need to be better investigated to first manage the flux of renewable energy and hence produce alternative fuel and energy. In addition, attention must be given to the technical feasibility of the hydrogen supply chain, which is mainly driven by uncertain, but clean solar and wind energy resources. Furthermore, the infrastructure of hydrogen presents many challenges and defies that need to be overcome for a successful transition to a future hydrogen economy. These challenges are mainly due to the existence of many technological options for the production, storage, transportation and end users. Given this main reason, it is essential to understand and analyse the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) in advance, in order to detect the important factors that may play increasing role in obtaining the optimal configuration.

"In Chapter 1, we show that imperfect substitutability in the indirect utility function can lead to disparity either between WTA and WTP – due to the opportunity loss – or between gains and losses, which reflects a net loss. In Chapter 2, we evaluate the impact of three auction mechanisms in the measurement of private willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept for a pure public good. Our results show that the endowment effect can be eliminated with repetitions of the BDM mechanism. Yet, on a logarithmic scale, the random nth-price auction yields the highest speed of convergence to welfare indices’ equality. In Chapter 3, we introduce a model which shows that bidders bid according to the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, contingent on a sequential weighting function, which neither ignores the incentive-compatibility constraints nor rejects the posted prices issued from others’ bids. In Chapter 4, we show that when agents are intrinsically impulsed, that is, they mostly provide the public good in order to alleviate their guilt, they tend to free-ride. In contrast, when agents are extrinsically impulsed and compete for social status, their provisions become strategic complements. In the latter case, the aggregate level of the public good increases as the disparity between agents’ incomes shrinks"

"The company can profit from a ""market advantage"" if it is perceived as ""socially responsible"" by its customers. From this point of view, it can aim to integrate ethics or sustainable development values in its strategy , even though efficiency then depends on the marketers' ability to turn those values into customer benefits through an adapted marketing policy. The goal of this research means to define the main dimensions of an ethics or sustainable development oriented marketing strategy in order to enhance the corporate institutional image as well as customer relational quality. Such a goal has required prior reflection on the ethic concept and has led to prefer a ""competence ethic"" whose utilitarian and strategic nature allows better anchoring in management sciences. It also led to a reflection on the integrated approach characteristics of ethic or responsible marketing. The approach is focused on three main features : Product (P), Relation (R) and Company Institution (I) and is highly impregnated with complementary logics of the Stakeholder theory, the Resource and Competence Theory and the Legitimacy Theory. In order to elaborate and back up our research, many empirical investigations like surveys, discussions, have been carried out among corporate managers as well as consumers, with a view to understanding their idea of a ""socially responsible"" organization"
"This thesis addresses several issues raised by the introduction in France of economic incentives such as pay-For-Performance applied to general practice. These incentive schemes are designed to improve the quality of care, but they are discussed both in terms of effectiveness and potential side effects. Initially, we assess the impact of the CAPI scheme on various indicators of quality of care: the consultation length and cancers screening. Then, using the discrete choice experiment methodology, we reveal general practitioners (GPs) preferences for devices aimed at improving the early detection of cancers. Finally, we analyse empirically the relationship between French GPs' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. We show that the CAPI has not had a significant impact on the selected quality indicators. In addition, GPs would be sensitive to potentially less costly nonmonetary devices. Eventually, we highlight a negative relationship between GPs' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Our results call for greater caution in the definition of economic incentives in general practice."
"This research discusses public policies related to the spatial organization of defense production as a public good with industrial dimensions. Our framework enables to incorporate the spatial factor in modeling such a production. How to integrate geographical space in defense economics? How does space structure the organization of defense production? Conversely, how does defense production structure space? Our research deals with the case of France and more particularly with the Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) of French defense equipment. In France, according to the Direction Générale de l’Armement, MRO costs represent between 35% and 50% of the whole life cycle cost of defense equipment. In 2012, they accounted for about 15% of total French defense budget. Optimizing MRO costs has become a top priority issue since the beginning of the 1990s. Such costs are still of concern during the 2010-2014 period, since maintenance equipment expenditures are rising about 8.7% on average. A good management of MRO aims at keeping – or improving – the availability of defense equipment while at the same time reducing MRO costs. With this objective and considering the evolution of the sizes of army sections and their equipment, the spatial organization of MRO appears as a structuring dimension from both static and dynamic perspectives. The dissertation is organized in four chapters: Chapter I is a literature review that legitimates the methodological approach adopted in this research. We survey the regional economics literature that has mainly focused on the location of defense activities within their surrounding economic environment. Chapter II examines the contemporary transformations in French defense (doctrine, budget and size of the army) in order to identify the geographic consequences of such changes. Chapter III deals with the evolution of MRO since the end of the Cold War. We study the evolution of the availability of military platforms, the MRO costs evolution and the main reforms that the French State put in place to improve the management of MRO. Chapter IV discusses the optimal spatial organization of defense MRO. Our model suggests that space provides an opportunity to optimize MRO cost. However, it remains a constraint that is hard to cope with, because of transport costs but also due to the military nature of MRO. We model a strategic constraint with an Operational Social Cost.This constraint takes into account the intrinsic specificities of military activities (e.g. availability of military platforms, strategic imposed locations). It allows us to underline and to discuss the balance of forces between agglomeration and dispersion in the production of defense MRO. The main contribution of this research is to incorporate space in modeling defense production. We defend the idea that the organization of defense production cannot be understood without taking space into account. Optimizing the defense effort is based on a spatial dimension inherent to the concept of defense itself and the territory that has to be defended. As a result, economic research about optimality in the spatial organization of defense should fit in a spatial framework. Beyond MRO matters, our methodology can be applied to other dimensions of defense and more particularly in a multinational framework with two countries, several countries or within an alliance."
"Commodity futures markets have a long history. However, since the beginning of the 21st century, both the financialization process and the development of futures markets on a non-storable commodity (the electricity) have shake up their functioning.The three essays of this thesis study theoretically and empirically commodity futures markets in different situations of functioning.The first essay is an empirical study that shows that the Samuelson effect exists on electricity derivative markets. As a consequence, it shows that storage is not a necessary condition for such an effect.The second essay is a model that shows how the dynamic behavior of storable commodity prices on a segmented futures market is affected by its physical characteristics, and more precisely by the cost of storage.Further, the third essay is a model that shows that financialization changes the risk sharing function of commodity futures markets, whatever the concerned maturity."
"This thesis investigates relationships between the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and energy markets. A special focus is given to fuel switching, the main shortterm abatement measure within the EU ETS. This consists in substituting Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) for hard-coal plants in off-peak power generation. Thereby coal plants run for shorter periods, which allows power producers to reduce their CO2 emissions. In Chapter 1, we outline different approaches explaining relationships between carbon and energy markets. We also review the literature relating to these issues. Next, we further describe the fuel switching process and, in particular, we analyze the influence of energy and environmental efficiency of thermal power plants (coal and gas) on fuel switching. In Chapter 2, we provide a theoretical analysis that shows how differences in the efficiency of CCGTs can rule interactions between gas and carbon prices. The main result shows that the allowance price becomes more sensitive to the gas price when the level of CO2 emissions increases. In Chapter 3, we examine interactions between carbon, coal, gas and electricity prices in an empirical study. Among the main results, we find that there is a significant link between carbon and gas prices in the long-run equilibrium.In Chapter 4, we analyze the cross-market price discovery process between gas and CO2 markets. We identified in previous chapters that there is a robust significant link between gas and CO2 markets. They are linked commodities, and their prices are affected by the same information. In an empirical analysis, we find that the carbon market is the leader in cross-market price discovery process."
"Exchange rate fluctuations have impacts on all the economic sectors mostly exports and imports, choice of investment, purchase power last but not least tourism. Tourism and exchange rate are very vulnerable to exogenous factors, hence the complexity that arises at the management level. Ensuring sustainable development became a priority for governments as well as for tourism businesses, thus, another complexity adds up for the tourism industry.Our studies have shown a notable impact of exchange rate on tourism, especially on the economic development of this sector. Applying an economic model based on tourism price competitiveness, we were able to estimate that an appreciation of 10% of the Euro could deteriorate the French tourism receipts by around 4 Billion Euros. On the other hand, a comparative study between Greece and Turkey showed price competitiveness on favor of Greece despite the economic crisis. Finally, the domestic tourism constitutes an essential pillar for any national tourism policy, at the same time, it prevents national currency deterioration."
"The topic of fuel poverty has generated an increasing interest in the economic, political and social spheres. This economics thesis examines the measurement and analysis of the interactions between three fundamental indicators of forced household expenses in terms of health, housing, and energy to identify the relevant factors needed for the implementation of actions that address and prevent fuel poverty. This paper presents an original theoretical and analytical study that investigates this phenomenon first in terms of equity, highlighting the existence of disparities and justifying the implementation of additional potentially new measures that promote greater equity in the allocation of energy among individuals. Furthermore, the study characterizes the dynamics of this phenomenon, providing invaluable information on the types of measures (e.g., social tariffs for energy, innovative models of payment for energy, housing renovation assistance) that could be implemented to prevent fuel poverty and thus address the underlying objectives of equity. The thesis then presents an analysis of the consequences of energy vulnerability on dimensions other than those directly referring to energy (i.e., health), raising political decision-makers’ awareness of the multidimensional and broad effects of fuel poverty on other dimensions of social vulnerability. Fuel poverty is a factor that contributes to the worsening of other disparities (i.e., health disparities), compromising public decision-makers’ pursuit of the objective of equity. Finally, the analysis of new innovative methods of payment that provide energy (i.e., prepayment) with fewer costs indicated that prepayment is a tool that could contribute to the respective goals of horizontal and vertical equity."
"This PhD dissertation is dedicated to the issue of ‘exclusivist’ growth and vulnerability characterizing Vietnam as well as developing Asia today. The chapters address three important aspects of vulnerability and inclusive development, namely: Informality (chapter 1), Education dilemma (chapter 2) and Non-standard employment (chapter 3). The contribution of this work lies in the novelty and relevance of research topics; the wide range of data used, both quantitative and qualitative, including Household Business and Informal Sector Surveys in Vietnam, and national Labor Force Surveys of various countries in Asia; as well as the originality of methodology. Chapter 1 investigates the heterogeneity of the informal sector in Vietnam, based on a unique quali-quanti approach. Chapter 2 focuses on the variation of the returns to higher education across the Vietnamese population with different estimation models. Chapter 3 is the first study that systematically examines the wage differentials induced by temporary job status in Asian developing countries. Overall, the whole thesis implies that human capital, employment, and income are interrelated facets of individual well-being, and that some development phenomena should be analyzed in their heterogeneity."
"In liberalised electricity systems, power markets are expected to ensure the long-term coordination of investments in order to guarantee security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness. In the reference energy-only market, it relies on the ability of power markets — where the hourly price is aligned with the marginal cost of the system — to provide an adequate price-signal for investors. However, in practice, questions have been raised about its ability to trigger investments in low-carbon technologies including in particular Renewable Energy Sources of Electricity (RES-E), and its ability to ensure capacity adequacy. After a characterisation of these market failures, this dissertation tackles the two research topics within a methodological framework based on a System Dynamics model developed to simulate private investment decisions in power markets.First, the results show that substituting out-of-market support mechanisms for RES-E by market-based investments helped by the sole implementation of a carbon price appears as a feasible solution to trigger RES-E development providing that there is a political commitment on a high carbon price. Second, it also appears that the energy-only market with price cap is ineffective to ensure capacity adequacy. Adding a capacity market or removing the price cap both bring benefits in terms of loss of load expectation and social welfare. Moreover, the capacity market is identified as the best option for regulators among the considered market designs."
"Chapter one examines the long run statistical characteristics of financial returns in France and the USA for selected assets. This study clearly shows that the returns’ distributions diverge from the Gaussian strategy as regards longholding periods. Thereafter we analyze the consequences of the non-Gaussian nature of stock returns on default-option retirement plans.Chapter two provides a reasonable explanation to the strong debate on the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The cause of the debate is often attributed to small sample sizes in combination with statistical tests for mean reversion that lackpower. In order to bypass this problem, we use the approach developed by Campbell and Viceira (2005) who have settled a vectorial autoregressive methodology (VAR) to measure the mean reversion of asset returns.The third chapter evaluates the speed of convergence of stock prices. A convenient way to characterize the speed of mean reversion is the half-life. Comparing the stock indexes of four developed countries (US, UK, France and Japan) during the period 1950-2014, we establish significant mean reversion, with a half-life lying between 4,0 and 5,8 years.The final chapter provides some results from a model built in order to study the linked impacts of demography and economy on the French pension scheme. In order to reveal the risks that are contained in pension fund investment, we use a Trending Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process instead of the typical GBM for modeling stock returns. We find that funded scheme returns, net of management fees, are slightly lower thanthe PAYG internal rate of return."
"This thesis studies the influence of work on job and life quality, the latter being considered through the perception that individuals have of their own health. The first chapter focuses on the long-term effects of job losses due to plant closure on job quality. We show that job loss negatively affects wages, perceived job insecurity, the quality of the working environment and job satisfaction, including in the long run. The two last chapters investigate gender differences in self-reported health. The second chapter provides descriptive evidence on the relationships between self-assessed health, gender and mental health problems, i.e. depression and/or affective pains. Finally, in the last chapter, we study the influence of social norms as proxied by the gender structure of the workplace environment, on gender differences in self-reported health. We show that both women and men working in female-dominated environments report more specific health problems than those who work in male-dominated environments. The overall findings of this thesis are twofold. First, losing a job has a negative impact on several dimensions of job quality and satisfaction in the long run. Secondly, mental diseases and social norms at work are important to understand gender-related differences in health perceptions."
"The aim of this thesis is to propose and develop the various multidimensional measures of poverty. There is a consensus on the multidimensional nature of poverty. Scientists, policy makers and development professionals agree that the monetary dimension (lack of income) is inadequate to represent poverty. On the basis of the work of Sen (Nobel Proze of Economics), particularly on the capability approach, we propose four different measures of poverty. The first one is a monetary measure based on the utilitarian approach ; the second is a subjective measure founded on household experience ; the third is a multidimensional axiomatic measure and the final one is a non-axiomatic measure based on the theory of fuzzy sets. They are implemented using survey data EDAM3-IS (Djiboutian Survey of Households 2012). The esults fall within the framework of economic growth in Djibouti. However, all the measures used have shown great disparities between the capital and the regions in terms of basic infrastructure and household welfare. Each method produced results with different interpretations of the determinants of poverty. This does not mean that there is one method being better than the other but rather each approach, in a particular context, may be more relevant. Thus, identifying the poor by applying the different measures of poverty gave us a clear-cut profile, which implies that the decision-maker must first set the aim in view in the implementation of anti-poverty policies. It can be emphasized that the inclusion of a subjective weighting in the process of measuring of poverty is one of our contributions towards the development of multidimensional measures of poverty."
"Microfinance aims at facilitating access to financial services for vulnerable people excluded from the traditional banking system. In that regard, it appears as a key tool to reduce inequalities, especially between men and women, to access credit. However, on the basis of a case study about the main Tunisian microfinance institution, this research work shows that when considering the loan conditions granted, the objective of inequality reduction is not fully achieved. If the institution indeed favors women in terms of access to credit, and despite the lesser risk female clients represent for the institution, women still receive lower loan amounts than men all along their credit history. The most ambitious women are in particular the most rationed ones. Putting the  analyses on microdata, experimental data and impact assessment of a training on loan officers into perspective suggests that gender inequalities existing in Tunisia and among clients contribute to create gender-based stereotypes among loan officers. Since current granting procedures leave some room for subjectivity, some inequalities are reproduced instead of reduced."
"The purpose of this doctoral research is to analyse the notion of innovation support through skills from clusters in regard to high-technology SMEs. More specifically, it intends to undertake a critical review of Competency Management implementation - as recommended by public institutions, in favour of Knowledge Management implementation. Therefore, we exploit the conceptual field of KM in SMEs and demonstrate the embedding of KM processes within SMEs’ business activity and organisation. Although the conceptual link between business activity and organisation has been already covered in the literature, we are here focusing on its operationalisation in high-tech SMEs to support innovation. Within the context of our CIFRE grant, we have applied a PAR Methodology (Participatory Action Research) allowing to study the OPTITEC cluster. The interest of this methodology lies in the ability to integrate key actors and implementing partners into the research activity. Thus, we frame the theoretical concept of KM in high-tech SMEs and imply a repositioning of the competitiveness cluster on the basis of this knowledge creation. Two levels of results are provided. The first consists of identifying the operationalization of KM supporting innovation within high-technology SMEs. The second one challenges the cluster’s role as a ‘third party’ in supporting innovation within high-tech SMEs."
"The objective of this thesis is to study the new dynamics and their impacts in the electricity sector. It discusses the critical issues from the perspectives of macroeconomics, structural configuration, and a transition to renewable energy sources. More precisely, three topics emerge: the nexus between electricity consumption and economic growth, the impacts of vertical integration between power generators and retailers, and the market impacts and integration issues of intermittent renewable generation. By studying these three topics, it provides answers to the key challenges of supply security, competitiveness and sustainable development in the energy sector. By giving new research directions of energy economics, it serves to inspire related policy debates."
"His  thesis  presents  a  series  of  theoretical  studies  sharing  a  common  methodology:  the  use  of  stock-­‐flow  consistent  models.  Based  on  the  failure  of  the  state  of  the  art  analytical  tool  of  the mainstream, the so-­‐called DSGE models, I attempt to show what are the main drawbacks of these models, which include both methodological problems and the omission of some aspects of reality that are crucial (e.g., the role of money and financial markets). In the first chapter of this thesis I show  why  stock-­‐flow  consistent  models  offer  a  more  accurate  vehicle  to  the  understanding  of  modern  economies.  These  reasons,  which  are  connected  to  a  higher  concern  with  realism, accounting  accuracy  and  the  interaction  between  the  different  economic  agents  and  social  institutions,  explain  why  stock-­‐flow  consistent  models  have  been  successful  in  detecting  the instabilities that were accumulating in the years before the outbreak of the global financial crisis..."
"This thesis is interested in accounting practices within SMEs, factors that are able to influence the use of accounting practices, the most developed costs as well as the operational and strategic contribution of these practices within the SMEs while making a comparison with the characteristics of midsize companies. We resorted to the contingency theory to set up our research. We contacted eight companies through several face- to -face interviews, and seventy companies through questioning. We found out that the SMEs characteristics as regards accounting of costs are different. This difference can be explained by three factors: the organization’s size, the product's diversity, and the decentralized structure of the company. Equally, we found out that the operational utility of instruments of accounting costs is looked as the most mannered one by companies that do not use them. However, the perception of the strategic utility do not differ between users and non-users of new methods"
"This thesis examines the effect of public policies on the functioning of competitive markets. It addresses one issue of competition policy and one issue of sectoral regulation. The first part of the thesis focuses on merger control: it first examines the effects of mergers on the prices of goods, and then the decision of the competition authority is endogenised. The first article examines whether one of the objectives justifying the existence of competition policy - the enhancement of consumer surplus - is achieved in practice for merger control. Using French multi-sectoral data, the effects of mergers on the prices of goods and services in the relevant sectors is estimated. In a second article, the decision of the competition authority is examined through an empirical analysis of the determinants of the opinions of the French Competition Council on mergers. The second part of this thesis deals with a regulation question: how restrictions on free entry are valued by the actors on the market, because of the anticipated profits. The determinants of this value are then estimated. This question is addressed in two situations: first, the value of the so called “digital dividend”, which corresponds to the spectrum released by the extinction of analogue broadcasting of television, then the value of a taxi license. The elasticity of the licence value to the number of granted licenses is estimated. "

"Since the first industrial revolution, “innovation” has been mentioned in numerous occasions. This term has often been associated with ""technological innovation"". Recently, a new type of innovation, management innovation, and its adoption process have been at the heart of attention. In numerous studies on organizational innovations, technological innovation is still a dominant subject and there is a need to go outside the limit of technological innovation studies. Diversified topics on management innovations have been studied, showing a particular attraction of this subject for scholars in this field. Management innovation processes have carefully been explored, in particular the generation, diffusion and adoption processes (with or without adaptation). However, the studies on management innovation adoption seem to be neglected. In addition, the mutual adaptation between management innovations and adopting organizations also need to be studied. In a more concrete way, it is essential to study the tension that can appear when introducing a management innovation into an organization as well as the mutual pressure between them during the adoption process. Nonetheless, the empirical studies on this issue still remain deficient. Consequently, we focus on the adoption processes of a management innovation and the tensions between this management innovation and its adopting organization during the adoption process. Every management innovation comprises a management philosophy while every organization pertains to certain representations. Consequently, the potential tensions during the adoption process can be viewed as the imperfect harmony between the management innovation philosophy and the dominant representations within the “host” organization. Hence, three important sub-questions emerge: (1) how to identify the management innovation philosophy and the organizational representations, (2) how to explain their agreements/disagreements of values during the adoption process and (3) how to avoid potential disagreements that can interrupt this process."
"This research is focused on emerging market of telemedicine. Telemedicine refers to the use of information and communication technologies for the delivery of distant clinical care. Here the concept of market has been considered as a social construction, within a sociotechnical perspective, with a game of actors located within a specific institutional environment, but also within a dynamic use of ict. Our research project aimed at analyzing the ways in which the logics of technology supply can be set out with the construction of relevant usages from the demand side. We laid special emphasis on the construction of an analytical framework of the emerging telemedicine market, which has enabled us to propose several hypotheses on its structuring. Since several years, the telemedicine market has been characterized by experiments on ict applications to healthcare. These experiments, which are main organizational configurations, have been brought mainly by stakes of technological innovations or organizational and socio-economic integration of devices. This assessment provided the analytical and methodological cornerstone of our work: to study, in situ and through specific conceptual frameworks, two experimental projects as archetypes of telemedicine projects. Our thesis statement is that telemedicine markets can be structured by the coalition of heterogeneous actors involved around a common value, expressed around a technological standard, platforms of technological and medical service offers; or a strategic view of territories. Therefore, business ecosystem models could be considered as a relevant organizational configuration to boost the emerging market of telemedicine. "
"Alliances have to deal with the dynamic of exploration and exploitation to innovate, which conducts to the ambidexterity concept. Managing ambidexterity is potentially led by the alliance managers who are boundary-spanners in alliances. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning their roles. The research seeks to identify the roles of alliance managers as boundary-spanners in managing ambidexterity in alliances."
"This thesis aims at modelling and optimize an agent's (called ""he"") investment strategies when subjected to a Markovian environment, and to a liquidity risk happening when he runs out of liquid assets during an expense. Throughout this work, we deem that he aims at avoiding default; for this purpose, investment opportunities are available to him, allowing to increase his future expected incomes at the price of an immediate expense, therefore risking premature bankruptcy since investment is deemed illiquid: our goal is to find conditions under which incurring such liquidity risks is more advisable than declining a permanent income."

"In a context of internationalization of higher education and research, we focus on two issues related to the recent dynamics of national university systems. First, from a supply microeconomic approach, we show that the level of public intervention and the non-rigid capacities of institutions explain the divergence of tuition fees between regulated and deregulated university systems. Then, from a macroeconomic demand approach, we try to underline the inelasticity of the demand from gravity models with non-price determinants of international student mobility"

"Until the late 90's, the most widely used software development methods were based on sequential approaches often referred to as plan-driven or document-driven methods. This type of development approach emphasizes upfront requirements definition, documentation and detaile plans. In order to adapt and rapidly react to technological competitive market, a set of new software methodologies called ""agile"" methods emerged, responding to the limitations of the so-called “heavyweight” approaches. These new methods refer implicitly to ""adhocratic "" organizations where coordination mechanisms are easily achieved (Mintzberg, 1984). What about complex and transversal organizational structures? How these innovation management models are developed and implemented in such contexts? The present thesis aims at analyzing these relevant questions through a longitudinal study using a practice-based perspective. The case study was carried out in a division of a French telecommunication company. This company has decided to change its managerial modes and to implement a set of new managerial practices based on agile methods. "

"Innovation has become a vital need for the firm to deal with a continuously changing environment. Evolutionary theory has emphasized the role of competences in firm analysis. Therefore, specific competences are essential for the fulfillment of firms’ innovation activities.According to evolutionary theory, internal competences are central to the firm. Though, they can be sometimes insufficient for it to innovate. Thus, innovation requires from the firm to look for complementary external competences to reinforce those existing internally.Besides the competences used in-house, competences can be acquired externally through freelancers or cooperative relationships. Basing on an evolutionary analytical framework enhanced with elements of competence-based view, the main body of this thesis analyses the behavior of French companies in terms of innovation. In other words, we seek to determine the factors increasing the innovation capacity of firms while stressing the influence of competences used in-house or acquired externally on the probability for firms to engage in innovation projects.Within this scope, we first invoke different approaches of innovation and then emphasize the importance of firm competences and its staff in addition to their participation into cooperative agreements for innovation. To finalize our interpretation, we conduct a descriptive analysis followed by a study based on the survey data of Innovation CIS 2010. The results show that the probability for firms to engage in innovation activities is affected by elements from the internal and external environment of the firm."
"The densification of urban areas and their periurban extension tend to greatly modify landscapes and lifestyles in these areas. Urban green spaces are becoming essential elements of modern urbanism. These contribute to the sustainability of cities and are acclaimed by the citizens. Despite the existence of opinion polls on green spaces and government reports on the underlying issues, few economic studies have been devoted to them. Given this situation, a better knowledge and understanding of green space policies are needed. Their non-market characteristic leads us to the issue of the management of public goods. We identify the sources of market failures in order to highlight economic problems inherent in the allocation of green spaces. It stems a need to identify individual preferences and understand public choices through both a positive and empirical analysis. The application of the hedonic pricing method in the city of Angers can highlight that resident households give value to green spaces. Through the use of indicators derived from landscape ecology, we show that not only access to green spaces, but also their distribution affects the choice of residential location. The identification of a demand leads us to consider the local supply of green spaces. To do this, we construct three samples from a survey and geographic information systems. We test the model of the median voter for municipalities in the region of Pays de la Loire, and then we test the model of horizontal externalities in samples of municipalities in the department of Loire-Atlantique and the urban area of Angers. Our results show the existence of mimetic behaviour between municipalities. "
"The aim of this dissertation is to analyze the evolution of the agricultural extension system in a Mediterranean context, in terms of organization, types of advice and methods of intervention drawn from a regional analysis of Syrian and Tunisian systems. This evolution responds to profound changes in the agricultural production model, historically based on the principles of the Green Revolution, which is evolving towards agro-ecological models. We situate this work in the movement known as the ""agro-ecological transition"", which proposes a framework of development associating socio-economic and environmental dimensions. This movement allows us to envision a better integration of agriculture and its stakes in the territorial development project. To design and implement the agro-ecological approach requires a profound change in the management of production systems. To ensure these changes, farmers need new support schemes. The analysis of the evolution of the extension systems is conducted from a theoretical and methodological framework constructed with reference to development theories, notably especially evolutionist, which take into account the general forces that determine local actions, and historicist, which give pace to development trajectories and singular territorial combinations. This framework assumes that the development does not depend on producers willing to adopt exogenous innovations but rather to participate in its elaboration. This participation meets two needs: i) the adaptation of innovation to the particularity of situations as the agroecological transition advocates ii) the decentralization of the management of socio-environmental goods, towards common forms. To deal with these challenges of transforming agricultural systems, we can be expected that the organization of agricultural extension has adapted by the passage of a system driven primarily by a public device, based on a single type of technical advice and on diffusionist methods of mass of extension, to a composite system offering several types of advice and individual or joint intervention methods based on the co-construction of the advice. Our analysis is based on an empirical work adapted to the situation of the two countries under study, circumscribed to the regions of Al Ghâb in Syria and Nabeul in Tunisia. The results are quite similar in both countries where the evolution of the agricultural sector occurs through small changes that rely more on the substitution of practices more economical and more respectful of the environment than previous practices, but these changes have not been accompanied by a significant evolution of the agricultural extension system. The state apparatus still occupies a monopoly position in Al Ghâb, and dominant in Nabeul. The organizational evolution of this system is limited, in both regions, to the deconcentration of services, with a timid privatization on the site of Nabeul. In both regions of study, the state apparatus uses classically collective counseling methods of advice based on the ""Training and Visit"" model, and is limited to a technical dimension based mainly on the proceeds of the Green Revolution, their contribution to the evolution of agricultural practices towards agroecology is not notable."
"The PhD studies different empirical methods to detect bid-rigging cartels. It shows first that simple statistical screens perform very well to detect bid-rigging infringement. Second, the econometric method of Bajari, well established in the literature, produces poor results."
"This thesis aims at studying systemic risk in commodity futures markets. A whole strand of the literature is dedicated to the ""financialization of commodity markets"", but also to the influence of the existence of futures markets on the spot price of their underlying asset. Indeed, since these commodity futures have been largely used by in asset management as diversifying assets, their financialization has raised concerns, especially seeing the evolution of their price, which seems to be similar to that of financial assets. My interest here is thus to quantify this systemic risk, provide a toolbox to assess the consequences of various scenarios (stress tests), but also to assess which markets should be monitored more closely (because they could threaten the real economy or the whole system)."
": In this dissertation, I question whether the territories coordinated under food system based on “agriculture of the middle” (SYAM in French) rely on a common set of values. By combining two sets of theoretical approaches (proximity economics and actor-network theory) on four empirical case studies in France, this doctoral research analyses the various merging mechanisms at play among SYAM actors. The research results suggest that SYAM networks strengthen through alternating phases of expansion and contraction, which challenge possibilities of convergence. The common system of values emerges, develops, recomposes and reconfigures itself based on these tensions. At times, the common values create a frame of reference for collective action; at others, it becomes a framework restricting it."
"Chinese footprint in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), as in other parts of the globe, has surged in the last fifteen years. Beyond the traditional drivers of this expansion from an economic perspective (securing resources and new markets), China represents a special partner for Latin-American countries because of grey lines delimiting public and private ownership, strict industrial policy and long-term development goals. Besides, regional discrepancies have appeared between South America, which benefited from the boom of Chinese demand for raw materials, and Mexico, which found itself in direct competition with China on different segments of his secondary sector, and whose integration dynamic in North America was deeply impacted by the growing shares of Chinese companies in the US market. Combining an extensive analysis of existing databases about foreign direct investments (FDI) from China in LAC and three original case studies of Chinese companies located in the manufacturing industry in Mexico, this dissertation shows unique features in these operations such as an accelerated growth path and relative adaptive skills to foreign environments. Nevertheless, the positive or negative externalities of Chinese FDI remain dependent upon the interactions between the institutional context of the host country and the companies’ strategies."
"Although the theoretical and empirical literature studying the effects of the WTO and trade liberalization on the economic performance of countries and the well-being is rich, it remains that there is a lack of consensus on the links trade-growth-poverty. The links are neither simple nor automatic and require to be treated with caution, and to take into account national specificities and the particular context of each country. Hence the special attention given to the Lebanese economy, characterized among others by a chronic trade deficit, and by the second longest WTO accession process, which dates from 1999 and seems far from over. To examine the impacts of Lebanon’s accession to the WTO on macroeconomic variables, a dynamic CGE model is used, and different scenarios are simulated. Using a sequential approach, the general equilibrium analysis is combined with a microsimulation analysis, evaluating the micro-economic impacts on different categories of households, poverty and inequality. The results suggest that the country's accession to the WTO leads to a more favorable economic performances compared to the baseline scenario (especially when the mechanism of the increase in total factor productivity is put into play). It also allows a reduction in poverty and inequality, by improving the situation of unskilled workers."
"Since the late 2000s, psychosocial risks (job strain, anxiety, burn out…) are a debating point. The literature explains it by the dissemination of a results-oriented culture which demands more and more to people and controls their performance by using management tools. Furthermore, to prevent psychosocial risks organizations also use management tools. That's why we focus our attention on the use of management tools in organizations to study the complex links between management control and psychosocial risks. Thus, our thesis aim to answer the following research question: to what extent management tools participate to psychosocial risks, to their creation and to their prevention ? To do this, we have first made an exploratory study and then four case studies in private and public organizations. So our qualitative design is composed by collecting 67 semi-structured interviews, two non-participatory observations and internal and external documents. By studying mutual relationship between perceptions of reality, individuals and management tools, we explore the complex mechanisms binding results-oriented culture, management tools and psychosocial risks."

"While brands are traditional topics for the marketing research, they do not retain much attention from organization studies. This thesis originally draws upon the recent « Brand at Work » trend that considers brands as an internal organizational resource affecting identity, a tool for organizational control. Drawing on an insider-research in the luxury industry and on rich empirical material (59 interviews), we show the existence of an archetypal managerial discourse, deeply infused by the marketing discourse, brand being both used as a management tool, and a way to disguise the reality of practices; turning the luxury into a “storytelling industry”. Looking at managers, both producers and receivers of the brand message, we reveal the role of the brand in their identity regulation (IR) processes. We found that the brand can either support their IR practices, managers willingly buying into the brand, or crystallize tensions, corrode IR and act as a dis-connecting mechanism between identity (re)formation and regulation processes. We show the centrality of brand in managers’ identity regulation processes."
"Volatility strategies have flourished since the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. Nevertheless, the recent catastrophic performance of such exchange-traded products has put into question their contributions for portfolio hedging and diversification. My thesis work aims to rethink and reinvent the philosophy of volatility strategies.From a preliminary empirical study based on the expected utility theory, Chapter 1 makes a diagnostic of traditional volatility strategies, based on buy-and-hold investments and passive replication of implied volatility. It exhibits that, although such portfolio hedging significantly outperforms traditional hedging, it appears strongly inappropriate for risk-loving investors.Chapter 2 paves the way for a new generation of volatility strategies, active, option-based and factor-based investing. Indeed, our both analytical and empirical decomposition of implied volatility smiles into a combination of implied risk premia, distinct and tradeable, enables to harvest actively the compensation for bearing higher-order risks. These insurance risk premia measure the pricing discrepanciesbetween the risk-neutral and the physical probability distributions.Finally, Chapter 3 compares our factor-based investing approach to the strategies usually employed in the hedge fund universe. Our essay clearly evidences that our tail risk premia strategies are incremental determinants in the hedge fund performance, in both the time-series and the cross-section of returns. Hence, we exhibit to what extent hedge fund alpha actually arises from selling crash insurance strategies against tail risks."
"This thesis aims at investigating empirically the effects of two financing strategies for low-income countries; debt relief and taxation. The first three chapters focus on the consequences of debt relief for public finance and new external financing. Results show that cancellations granted under the multilateral debt relief initiatives have been beneficial for recipient countries by significantly improving the composition of their budget and widening financing opportunities. However, findings also underline the risk of moral hazard stemming from these initiatives which thus calls for continuous sound fiscal management, especially after debt relief. Lastly, the fourth chapter revisits the taxation-growth nexus adopting a macro-micro approach. Using firm-level data in developing countries our findings suggest that taxation is favorable to firms' activity, especially when firms operate in poor countries characterized by a significant lack of infrastructure. Moreover, this effect of taxation seems to be maximal in the absence of corruption, hence reaffirming the need for healthy and enabling economic and political environments in developing countries."
"Nowadays, the deep geological repository is generally considered as the reference solution for the definitive management of spent nuclear fuel/high-level waste, but different countries have decided different disposal deployment schedules. Via the economic calculation, we hope to offer some answers to the following question: In terms of disposal time management, how should the present generations, benefiting from the nuclear power generation, bear the costs of radioactive waste management, while taking into account future generations? This thesis proposes to analyze specifically the French decision in its context. We propose a set of tools to evaluate the Utility of the deep geological repository project according to the deployment schedule choices. Our thesis also studies the influence of disposal choices on the nuclear fuel cycle. Beyond, we also take into account the interactions between the deep geological repository, nuclear fleet and cycle choices which constitute a ""complete system""."
"The implicit dimension is a key component to the understanding of organizations. Indeed, service relationships are the fertile ground to its analysis. Within these relationships, the role of third parties, in the activity of the agent in co-action, questions especially the mobilized competence. The agent activity, in turn, explores his/her culture in particular. Culture and competence become two interacting dialectical concepts. The aim of this thesis is to analyze in depth this dialectic in situ. Adopting a social constructivist posture and a cognitive-situational approach, a qualitative study with Agents in Touch with Customers (ACC) of the SNCF was carried to address this issue. For this purpose, we based our analysis on semi-structured interviews combined with an ethnomethodological study, followed by a “confirmatory” survey via focus groups (mirror groups). The results of this research show us that, in situation, a sort of situated culture emerges through the situated and distributed competence; and that this situated culture follows a spiral movement between the implicit and the explicit. It also reveals that this situated culture is an essential element in the competence architecture, in addition to the fact that the distributed competence develops especially in an organization designed as a culture (metaphor of culture)."
"Trade liberalization, the development of mean of transport and the development economic of emerging countries which lead to globalization of supply chain is irreversible phenomen. They can reduce costs, in return, they multiply the risk of disruption from upstream stage to downstream  stage. In this thesis, we focus on the inbound supply chain stage. We treat more specifically the case of a purchasing central to select suppliers and allocate the orders. Each of the suppliers cannot deliver its orders due to internal reasons (poor quality problems) or external reasons (natural disasters, transport problems). According to the selected suppliers deliver their orders or not, the transaction operation will generate a profit or loss. The objective of this thesis is to provide decision support tools to a decision maker faced with this problem by taking into account the behavior of decision maker toward risk. We proposed stochastic mixed integer linear programs to model this problem. In the first part, we focuses on the development of a decision support visual tool that allows a decision maker to find a compromise between  maximizing the expected profit and minimize the risk of loss. In the second part, we integrated the techniques of estimation of risk VaR and CVaR in this problem. The objective is to help decision maker to minimize the expected cost and minimize the conditional value at risk simultanously via calculating of VaR. Result shows that the decision maker must tack into account the different scenarios of disruption regardless their probability of realisation."

"This thesis studies the behaviour of investors in open-end mutual funds and its implications to the liquidity risk. We seek to help the fund managers to avoid the ""fund run"" scenarios where they loss their clients in a sudden way. We begin our research by collecting a unique data set which records the micro-transactions of fund investors. It allows us to monitor investors’ behaviour at the individual level and to accomplish three research articles around this topic. In the first article, we develop a self-exciting counting process to model the stylized facts of fund flows. Therefrom, we highlight a novel risk linked to the fund liability which is different than the asset-related risk documented by the previous literature. We also identify a liquidity contagion among different investors in a same fund. In the next chapter, we study the dispersion in the investing horizons of individual fund clients. These horizons are strongly determined by investors’ characteristics and economic conditions. We show that the fund managers suffer a pre-mature redemption risk, i.e. clients shorten their investing horizons and redeem pre-maturely. Especially, we observe a heterogeneity among investors: long-term ones bring a higher pre-mature redemption risk. In the last chapter, we are interested in the rebalance behaviour. We find that numerous investors hold a multi-funds portfolio and rebalance it to keep the target asset allocation."
"A loss of industrial competitiveness is a major concern for energy and environmental policy design. This thesis studies the impacts of energy prices and environmental regulation asymmetries among countries on the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in Europe and in the World. First, main factors of competitiveness in two energy-intensive industries, steel and paper sectors, are identified with econometric methods. The role of energy is then quantified and weighted relatively to these other factors. In particular, the evolution of exports and production for a national industry, as well as changes in production capacities of a factory, are analysed. Secondly, high energy prices, or a new environmental regulation, do not impact only energy-intensive industries but also downstream manufacturing sectors. The scale of the research is therefore extended to the whole manufacturing industry on a global scope. The objective is to grasp energy interdependencies between industrial sectors all along the production chain, including national differences in energy use. The study is based on a matrix calculation method using Input-Output tables. Energy dependence of national industries is not only a domestic issue, but also an international one."

"This thesis analyses the evolution of national and global clusters at their varying paces. Although they were initiated by French cluster policy, each is based on its specific ecosystem. However, they all have to adapt themselves to their political, socio-territorial and economic environment to “live”, respecting simultaniously the constrainsts imposed from top-down as well as the objectives of the local actors (public and privat research, firms and municipalities) to achieve their assignments: increase the national competitivity. The core objective is to understand the origin of the dynamism of the evolution of a cluster by definition rooted in the area in which it is situated, reltive to its environment. The methodology upheld in our work consists in analysing each of the 71 clusters, not to give a general representation of a model of the evolution of a cluster, but to find a common territorial characteristic in order to understand what differentiates the strongest from the weakest cluster. The framework of reference adopted in this thesis is based on the history of the field of activity of its territory which predetermines its life path. "

"This thesis aims to understand the impact of the internal factors (internal production structures and conflicts between interest groups) for the international economic integration of Russia. The research combines the analysis in terms of international economics with that of international political economy (IPE). The former allows a detailed analysis of Russia's international specialisation in exchanges of goods and capital, while the latter provides the analytical framework for analysing the pattern of changes. Firstly, we show a growing dependency on the export of natural resources, independent of the geographical (political) circle of countries analyzed. Secondly, we argue that the analytical framework of the IPE should be adapted to the Russian context. So, the period of the 1990s is characterized by a large scope of personal arrangements and individualized relations within a captured and fragmented State. After the beginning of the 2000s, this situation is reversed given the centralization of the central State and a quest for more institutionalized relations between the State and firms. This thesis contains three parts. The first part presents an economic analysis of the integration of Russia into the world economy. The second part studies the evolution of Russia’s internal institutional context. The third part compares the internal preferences towards economic integration with those of Russia's main trade partners, which are i) the Commonwealth of Independent States, ii) the European Union and iii) China and the United States.

"This thesis deals with public policy of cultural industries using the tools of industrial organization. The introduction reviews the relationship existing between the fields of industrial organization and cultural economics. It sets out some features of cultural goods that set them apart from the usual objects of industrial organization and shows how the latter can deal with such goods. The first essay deals with the fixed book price. Il reviews the relevant theoretical and empirical literature and assesses the impact of this policy when the sector is confronted to the arrival of the e-book. The second essay develops a model of book retailing. This market is formalizes as two differenciated market a la Salop, one with competitively retailed blockbusters and the other regular titles sold by a monopoly bookshop. It shows that the possibility for publishers to know whether their title will be a blockbuster or not deeply changes strategies, maket outcomes and the efficiency of a fixed book price. When that possibility do not exist, consumers, non-blockbuster publishers and the bookshop are better off. The third essay deals with broadcasting quotas. It shows that faced with consumers of heterogeneous and specific tastes, a radio is confronted to a trade-off between broadcasting more often titles it already broadcasts and choosing new titles. When domestic and foreign titles are imperfect substitutes, a quota of one type of title forces the radio to reduce the diversity of tides it broadcasts. This effect is robust to sequential competition between radios"
"This thesis encompasses the general problematic of the ""new urban question"". Its objective is to question the reality of the urban segregation of the Francilian region during the 1990s. We first define the three theoretical elements that delimit the parameters of this phenomenon's evaluation: the conception of individual well-being and its measure, the general ethical frame used to assess the aggregated level of well-being and the definition of segregation itself. We propose a definition of the individual well-being (the ""effective social condition"") compatible with Sen's capability approach, and we choose an ethical criterion sensitive to inequality. After specifying the statistical tools relevant to an operationalisation of the capability approach, we conduct an empirical application that leads us to the conclusion that many spatial units were indeed segregated in Île-de-France during the 1990s.

"This thesis is composed of three mostly empirical papers related to discrimination on the French labor market and one methodological paper using American data. The first one focuses on the wages and the employment status of French workers of Maghrebian origin, the second one focuses on their wages and hierarchical positions, the third one focuses on the heterogeneity of their employment gap relative to French workers whose parents were French at birth, and the fourth one re-examines the data from a controlled experiment assessing the impact of a criminal record on the probability of being hired. The value added of these papers is twofold. First they provide new evidence regarding the situation of second generation immigrants on the French labor market. Differences in wages and employment are high. However, once taken into account individual characteristics (age, qualification, etc. ), most of the wage gaps disappear, but substantial differences in employment and hierarchical positions remain. Moreover we provide an original description of the heterogeneity of the employment gap showing that it is wider for the individuals whose characteristics are associated to the lower employment probabilities (as identified in the reference population) than for those with the higher ones. Second, these papers bring methodological material to study discrimination. The first three papers try to incorporate notations and ideas which are now standard in public policy evaluation and consequently raise new issues regarding the decompositions of wage and employment gaps. The fourth article tries to discuss the methods commonly used in paired audit studies. "
"The thesis revisits the debates on the socio-economic impacts of a carbon tax reform and the controversies over the choice of a scheme. A diagnosis is primarily based on a review of a French failure (the carbon tax of Nicolas Sarkozy, 2009-2010). It distinguishes between problems of political acceptability and limits of economic analysis to define the scheme. The importance of the discussion about the use made off the tax proceeds is stressed. This point is indeed behind the political problems and determines the economic and legal consistency of the project with regard to the objectives (environment, equity, competitiveness). It shows that existing analytical tools can be improved to enable social dialogue and support collective bargaining on this point. A numerical simulation tool is then proposed and built. It can be used i) to compare the impacts of different schemes on various indicators (CO2, activity, employment, inequality, poverty, public debt), ii) to describe several views about how the economy works and will work in the future, and iii) to link the design of a climate policy with the other challenges of a tax reform (deficits reduction, funding of pensions). This tool is then used to revisit the controversy, clarify the tradeoffs and identify the best ways to find a compromise. It appears that the carbon taxation can provide co-benefits from a socio-economic viewpoint (for activity and employment, inequalities and deficits reduction). But this is not automatic : Some sensitive political choices must be made with regard to, not only the objective of climate action, but also the other challenges of a public finance and fiscal policy reform.

"Relating to the relation between education and growth in sub-Saharan Africa countries, this thesis aims to examine the socio-economic trajectories of 33 Anglophone, Francophone and Maghrebian countries. The goal is to seek the socioeconomic reasons for the socio-economic backlog of the countries of this sample in order to contribute to the debate on the growth promotion policies on the continent. In particular, it aims to show, on the one hand that education is not the only explanatory factor for the weak income trajectories sub-Saharan African countries (SSA), and on the other that, the econometric models as well as the variables of interests have an impact on the results obtained. It is attempts, finally, to question the direction of the strong causality which exists between education and the economic growth. In the present state of knowledge, theories of growth (neoclassical and endogenous), and recent attempts to take into account data from African countries, in particular through the analysis of the effects of threshold and the trap poverty, have all experienced significant difficulties in explaining the socio-economic sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, our thesis proposes an extension that aims to integrate the specific and individual time, while controlling the means of endogeneity and simultaneity of the data in this sub-region. From these analyses, three fundamental lessons emerge. Firstly, the impact of education is positive and significant for all countries of the sample. However, this impact varies on the basis of method and the dependent variable used - GNP and GDP. Secondly, it seems that education is not the main explanatory factor of African economic weakness. Repeated armed conflicts and civilians troubles, the lack of economic opportunities, the importance of socio-economic inequalities, and regional disparities as well as social polarizations are the main brakes on development of the sub-region. Lastly, education appears to be effect rather than the cause of economic growth in this African sample. We conclude that the impact of education is conditioned by political, economic and social stability. In the same way, improvement of transparency and good governance remain requirements to stimulate public and private investments in order to renew the economic growth in SSA"
"This dissertation examines the economic impacts of Civil Union (pacs) and marriage in France. It is divided into three chapters. Chapter 2 evaluates the effect of taxation on the number of pacs contracted in France. Chapter 3 aims at determining if the pacs is a substitute to marriage. On that purpose, it analyzes the evolution of marriage rates and the evolution of the age at first marriage since the pacs has been created in 1999. Chapter 4 questions the economic imp of marriage: it estimates the impact of marriage on credit constraints of couples. Taxation had a clear impact on the increase in the number of contracted pacs by year. But the evolution of the number of pacs has not decreased the number of marriages. The recent trends exhibit declining marriage rates and increasing ages at first marriage but they are a continuation of previous trends observed for the 1ast 25 years. The dec1ine in the marriage rates, joined with the development of cohabitation introduces a difference between unmarried and married couples. The latter are more likely to form investment projects but they do not benefit from their marital status on the credit market. They suffer bad terms of credit, indicating that marriage selects couples more willing to invest in housing. "
"Differences of opinion researchers on the impact of IT on organizational performance and the lack of research on the use of the Internet from a strategic perspective in the hospitality industry seeking the further research, especially in a country like Morocco, where tourism is one of the main engines of the economy and social peace. Given its important informational component due to its characteristics of intangibility, inseparability, heterogeneity and perishability, tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the development of the Internet. However, the penetration of direct electronic distribution is still fairly low in Morocco. The tourism distribution is characterized by the predominance of Tour Operators (TO) despite the undeniable potential international Internet in empowering local tourism providers and the international trend that promotes disintermediation. In this research, we consider that the internet has no eigenvalue but derives its importance from its idiosyncratic use in the development of managerial skills and organizational strategic objectives expected. By enrolling in the current resource theory ""Resource-Based View"", our research aims to explore new approaches to the use of the organization's capabilities. This research explores the dynamic capability perspective as well as strategic alignment - in line with the approach by ""trajectory"" of Henderson and Venkatraman (Strategic Alignment. Leveraging information technology for transforming organizations) initiated in 1993 and later moving to a synchronized approach to urbanization SI - as relevant resources to support the strategic direction of the internet technology and its eco-system opened in the hospitality industry. This research follows a deductive reasoning is to test four hypotheses by the method (PLS regression by partial least squares) over a hundred hotels and tourist establishments located in Morocco in general and in the region of Marrakech in particular. However, before testing the structural model of research, verification of the factor structure of the constructs of the research will be conducted by a principal component analysis (PCA) to propose a reduced number of factors that render much information as possible. Testing of hypotheses in this research indicate that strategic alignment maturity is related significantly with the performance of hotels and increases both the volume and nights billed loyalty tourists users. Note also that the capability maturity provides a dynamic preacher relevant Internet. However, the difficulty of maintaining a stable level of capability maturity and arouses our curiosity tools to study processes and different levels of maturity in a longitudinal and multi-period, this is a track to investigate in the future research in information systems and e-tourism.

"In this thesis, we tackle the problem of data revision. The nonfinal character of the macroeconomic statistics is analyzed, of kind to being able to identify the various aspects of their revision, that it is periodic or not. The first part recalls the literature which approaches the problems of data revision, where we expose the principal results in the statistical description of the phenomenon as of the first analyses, by confronting them with the more recent studies, in order to recognize its evolution. We expose at the same time, the results obtained in the predictibility of the process of revision, by detailing all the techniques of modeling as all the macroeconomic variables which are concerned by this phenomenon, and its influence in the improvement of quality of the forecast and the techniques of modeling. The second part will relate to the monthly series of foreign trade of France, concerned with the phenomenon of data revision. We describe the statistical properties of the periodic revision of our variables of interest, by applying our analyses to an important database, recalling the historical evolution according to an old and a new classifications. We are exerted then in a third and last part, to be able to predict the regular process of revision, for exploiting these results in the improvement of the quality of short-term forecasts. "

"A new accounting system was born in France, following the industrial revolution; it was called ""industrial accounting"", and we try here to describe its birth. In the 18th century France, because of the relatively low level of industrial development and the immaturity of the economical environment (privileges, monopolies, low investments), there was no need for systematic costing, nor for double-entry bookkeeping. Such pioneer practices could only appear solitarily and by a mere chance. After the industrial evolution, former industrial firms (Saint-Gobain, Allevard, Baccarat) made a complete change of their accounting system, as an answer to a new economical environment with generalized competition. Then industrial accounting (costing + double-entry bookkeeping) spread, as a necessity. At the same time, the theory of industrial accounting developped; several books were written, the first in 1817. After 1865, industrial accounting was generally accepted and tought, so that class books were published, according to school programs. "

"The objective of this research is to explain the answers of the French consumers towards a request of personal data from the companies. The study of the literature and two exploratory studies make it possible to identify the factors influencing the behavior of the consumers towards such a request. We deduce a conceptual model aiming at exposing the decision-making process of the individual, since the exposure to the request until its answer, which is tested by an experimental methodology. The results validate the process of answer and show that the situational factors have a major influence, higher than the personal convictions. The effect of the privacy policy and of the quantity of required data is proven. The impact of the context in which information is requested and of the level of familiarity with the company is more delicate to apprehend. "

"The double constraint of climate change and increasing scarcity of oil requires that we consider alternative energies for the medium term. This thesis focuses on the development of a hydrogen economy, which is conditional on the existence of an infrastructure for the distribution of the new fuel and the readiness of fuel cells. The main idea is that the state can play a central role in both infrastructure implementation and preparation of fuel cells technology. The thesis begins with a techno-economic analysis of the hydrogen-energy chain, which highlights the difficulty of setting up the infrastructure. The study of the development of electricity and gas networks in the past provides the empirical basis supporting the hypothesis that government can play an important role to consolidate the diffusion of socio-technical networks. In addition, private projects of stations may be justified by early-move benefits, although their financial viability depends on the demand for hydrogen which is in turn dependent on the performance of the fuel cell vehicle. The introduction of radical innovations, such as fuel cell, has been made more difficult by the domination of conventional technologies. This assertion is particularly true in the transport sector which was progressively locked into fossil fuels by a process of technological and institutional co-evolution driven by increasing returns of scale. Hence, fuel cells may primarily diffuse through the accumulation of niches where the innovation is closer to commercialization. These niches may be located in portable applications segment. Investments in research and demonstration are still necessary in order to reduce costs and increase performances of fuel cells. Using a simple model of multitechnological diffusion, we analyze the competition between the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and the plug-in hybrid car for the automotive market. We show that an early entry of the latter may block the arrival of hydrogen in the market. Other than fuel cell preparedness, a mass diffusion of hydrogen requires a sufficient coverage of the supportive infrastructure. The continuation of public support for R & D, a carbon tax (tax or permits) and demand stimulation are measures capable of accelerating the entry of hydrogen in the market. "

"In this research, we examine the motives underlying fair trade product purchase through two studies using a means-end methodology. Considering the growth of fair trade product consumption and the expansion of its distribution in two different distribution networks, a first exploratory research has been led. It shows that motives and, more particularly, means-end chains underlying fair trade coffee purchase differ depending on the types of retail store chosen (specialized shop vs. Supermarket). Then, fair trade coffee buyers who shop in supermarket have been interviewed in a second study. In the one hand, it permits to define choice criteria, consequences and values underlying this purchase, as well as seven groups of motives and several consumption styles. In the other hand, this purchase appears to be an utilitarian behaviour rather than a symbolic one, and it is led by a fragmentary judgment rather than an emotional one that is why consequences have a more important impact on the fair trade purchase than values underlying this behaviour. Moreover, means-end chains content and structure vary considering contextual variables such as attitudinal, behavioural, demographic and situational variables. Beyond these main results, a new way to collect laddering data has been developed by adding a list of attributes, consequences and values to the paper-and-pencil technique. Several techniques to collect ladders have also been compared and their quantitative analysis by PLS has been improved"
"The objective of this dissertation is to evaluate the effect on growth of reductions in external debt granted through the HIPCs Initiative. After recalling, in the first chapter, the specificities of the debt in HIPCs, we present the HIPC Initiative, in the second chapter. It aims to restore debt sustainability. The third chapter links growth to sustainability through the debt overhang model which highlights the impact of debt on investment. However, limitations appear. The fourth chapter shows the importance of intertemporal preferences in the debt-investment relationship when access to capital markets is limited. Debt depresses investment in presence of a low preference for smoothing. Strong in the case of HIPCs, it calls into question the debt overhang. To make sure, we develop in the next two chapters, a study focusing on HIPCs. This confirms the absence of debt overhang. To complete this study, an evaluation of the results of reduction is presented in the seventh chapter. A higher growth is observed which seems to be the consequence of better governance"

"This research aims to analyse how the relationship between franchisor and franchisee evolves, especially when the networks reach maturity. Time is viewed as linear in terms of the concept of the life cycle and as discontinuous when events occur in franchised networks which may modify the psychological contract between the two partners. This research examines four different life cycles and four different types of event observed in franchise networks. The empirical part of this study consists of case studies of 19 different franchise systems. Both franchisors and franchisees were interviewed in depth using narrative methods. The selection of the samples was undertaken in order to have sufficient diversity. The data were analyses using a combination of classical analysis and computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (Alceste and Sphinx lexical). Several results are discussed: 1) Franchisors tend to be more directive with franchisees as the franchise reaches maturity. 2) A large number of events are observed in franchise systems. Concentration and changes of ownership that entail a unilateral change of contracting party. Changes in strategies that constrain the franchisees. The psychological contract is changed and sometimes the time horizon of the relationship. 3) Franchisees do not constitute a homogeneous group, as many studies assume. Two groups are distinguished in which the psychological contract is different: the franchisee who “creates his job” by joining a franchise system and “developers” who own multiple stores. 4) The industry and the institutional context influence the psychological contract. 5) The concept of a psychological contract is useful as a means of clarifying and making operational the concept of trust between the contractual partners. The thesis provides a synthetic representation of the content of the franchisor-franchisee relationship and suggests recommendation in order to improve the franchisor’s management of the network. "

"Regarding the well known spatial concentration of innovation activities, the issue of partnerships dedicated to innovation has been widely studied for twenty years or so. But this research mainly focused on tacit knowledge exchanges as a determinant of these collaborations. The purpose of our work is to propose new explanations through testing scarcely studied determinants linked to the process of partnerships build up. Within that scope, we develop a theoretical framework which stresses constraints related to the search of complementary resources, on the one hand, and constraints linked to the possibilities to be in contact with partners (through social networks, institutions or past collaborations), on the other. We reveal how these two constraints, behind the problem of knowledge exchange, impact the geography of knowledge collaborations and its dynamic. Based on a qualitative analysis and an econometric treatment of relational data about knowledge collaborations, our work checks the multiscale dimension of innovation and exposes its inertia. We then measure the respective weights of the different determinants of these partnerships geography. We highlight both the structuring role of resources constraints and the spatial proximity effects. These latter effects are less due to constraints of knowledge exchange than to possibilities to connect with partners. More generally, the logics of contact, used in order to find a partner, play a structuring role in the geography of knowledge collaborations. This role happens to be different according to the very nature of these logics and the structural characteristics of the territories"

"Ten years (1994-2004) it took Internet to access the legitimacy in the field of French communication consultancy. Its pioneers, the so called “digital natives”, young people full of audacity with few experiences, would have to fight hard and survive the crisis of the Internet bubble in 2000-2003 before being acknowledged as experts in a field where, historically, advertising people used to control everything. Today, everyone has the eyes on the ""digital"". The future strategies are guided by digital communication which appears to be a powerful lever for growth in the face to traditional media shunned by advertisers. By becoming the stake of the field, Internet has exacerbated tensions which have existed before between advertising and marketing services (direct marketing and sales promotion); creating opportunities for innovative entrepreneurship"

"The aim of this dissertation is to analyze the convergence process between European regions by taking into account spatial patterns of economic activities. First, with the help of literature reviews on theoretical and empirical analyses of growth and convergence and on economic geography models, we show in chapter 1 why geographic disparities should be introduced in the study of convergence between economies. Next, the spatial statistic and econometric tools allowing to reach this goal are detailed in chapter 2. Finally, three empirical studies of the convergence process in presence of geographic disparities are carried out. They are based on a sample for per capita GDP of 138 regions, belonging to 11 countries for the period 1980-1995. The data are extracted from the Eurostat-Regio databank. In chapter 3, an exploratory spatial data analysis shows that the GDP distribution is characterized for the whole period by a strong geographic concentration (positive spatial autocorrélation) and by a North/South polarization pattern (spatial heterogeneity). In chapter 4, regressions linking the average annual growth rate between 1980 and 1995 to the per capita GDP in 1980 are carried out. The estimation of a beta-convergence model with spatial error autocorrelation and structural instability allows detecting positive and significant geographic spillover effects between neighboring regions and differentiating the convergence process between northern regions from the convergence process between southern regions. In chapter 5, the estimation of Markov chains indicates that the mobility of a region within the GDP distribution is very slow and that it is strongly conditioned by its neighbors, highlighting a geographic lock-in effect.

"This dissertation analyzes the decision processes within universities that drive the educational supply using stakeholder analysis as the main theoretical framework. Whereas the value distribution process has an effect on the production process, the organizational context emphasises a peculiar dimension. The integration of the needs of key stakeholders in higher education allows for the measurement of individual contributions to the value creation process, through the decisional process. The dissertation attempts to justify the existence of the mechanisms of control within the universities beginning with the study of the decisional rights and from their alienability. Those concepts allow to define the existing organizational architecture through three dimensions: the distribution of the decision rights, the performance evaluation system, and the system of incentives. These research questions are discussed find preliminary answers in four case studies of French universities, which enable to develop system-wide generalizable hypotheses. "
"The process of regional integration implies the collective awakening of the countries anxious to improve their economic and social advancement. In this study, the principal set of problems is to reconcile the South-South co-operative and economic efficiency. In fact, if the presence of South Africa within the SADC quarantees an international credibility at the zone, it's important all the same to stress that the southern area is victim of the serious evils likely to weaken and to destroy the expected efforts and effects of regionalism. Although it creates trade and attracts the overseas investments, the SADC must be harnessed to reabsorb not only the problem of political inefficiency but also the social problems such as civil violence, racial and ethnic wars, pandemic of HIV/AIDS and others serious diseases, if it wishes to preserve its economic dynamism. That's why regional integration, with the support of the international community, must play a key role in these fields. Indeed, our empirical results show that if the countries of the SADC manage to circumvent the obstacles related to their regional union, the southern zone could to develop better prospects in terms for economic development and emergent area.

"The economic theory suggests that financial development spurs economic growth. However, the implementation of financial liberalization policies in some countries had not yielded the results expected, casting doubt about the broad positive link between financial development and economic growth. The purpose of this dissertation is to figure out factors that can account for the contrasting views on the growth enhancing effects of financial development, and to draw implications for poverty alleviation. First, we consider that financial development may be positively correlated with financial instability, therefore dampening the favourable effect of finance on growth. As a result, we take this relationship into account in order to assess properly the contribution of finance on growth. Second, we study threshold effects in the relation between financial development and growth since below a given level of economic development, financial development may have no effect on economic growth, mainly because of low investment return and a lack of sufficient saving to fund projects. Finally, as much of the literature deals with the link between finance and growth and has devoted little attention to poverty reduction, we investigate the likely positive effect of finance development on poverty reduction beyond its favourable impact through economic growth. In addition, we also consider the negative effect financial instability may have on the poor. Econometric estimates on a sample of developing countries with panel data over the period 1966-2000 support our main hypotheses"
"Although shopping behavior becomes more and more important within marketing academic literature, most of research on this topic does not actually observe shopping behavior. Most of the time, it is measured with questionnaires that capture self-reported behavior, which is potentially very different from actual behavior. However, consumer purchases, most of the time decided in store, directly depend on physical shopping behavior (shopping path, alleys that consumer visits or avoids, products he passes by, actions he performs in front of shelves, products he grabs, investigates, tries and eventually abandons or chooses). This dissertation’s main idea is to study in-store physical shopping behavior. This thesis is divided into two studies. The first study aims at better understanding what physical shopping behavior is: get an intelligible picture of this behavior by determining what its main dimensions are as well as its relationships with purchases. The second study aims at using the information contained in physical shopping behavior in order to improve a probabilistic model of purchase analysis: market basket analysis. Both these studies allow investigating a different angle of the main topic. Together, they bring original insights about in-store shopping behavior. To reach our research objectives, we have developed a new data collection tool allowing to unobtrusively observe consumers, and capture and time-stamp each of their precise actions during the entire shopping trip.

"This thesis is a theoretical and methodological analysis of the contingent valuation method based on a survey on the demand for sanitation services conducted in Mshi (Tanzania). The first part is an historical literature review of the method. It shows that, after having been conceived to value benefits and provide information about the legitimacy of public policies, the contingent valuation method has been used, in developing countries, to measure demand as an indicator of projects’ feasibility. Thus, an independent literature has emerged, using however the same theoretical foundations than the ones of welfare economics. The second part explores this theory, makes a critical appraisal of its utilitarian foundations and propound a new theoretical framework to interpret the results of contingent valuation surveys. Rejecting the possibility of valuing a global benefit, this framework reintroduces society and ethics concept in individuals’ decision making. It suggest to interpret the answers to the questions about non-market goods through the payment vehicle and the compromise presented to the person interviewed. For market goods, this framework propound to interpred the answers as a consumer demand which is not predetermined by a substance (as utility) but constructed in a context dependent process. The third part of the thesis exposes, through the Moshi survey (re-baptized contingent measure of demand), the methodological (time to think, bargaining game, willingness to work, study of the rental market) and operational conclusions of this new theoretical framework.

A second study shows consequences of Internet exploratory on in-store buying behaviour. Chosen product are little modified (essentially in terms of brands) and explained by the joining of persuasion model and planned behaviour model. "
"The general idea of thesis is that European Emissions Trading system (ETS) is the instrument that can facilitate the decarbonisation of European electricity system. However, the necessary conditions ought to be brought together in the context of liberalisation in terms of risk management, market architecture and setting up of the complementary public policy instruments, in order for the carbon price signal to be effective. The introduction of liberalisation in the electricity industry conditions significantly the investment choice. The analysis of theoretical market model allows demonstrating organisational inadequacy for developing an optimal technological mix and for adapting to long-term issues due to the extreme difficulty of interpreting the price signals. The introduction of ETS overlaps with the market risks inherent to liberalisation. The enlargement of the carbon market and the interaction of European objectives in the horizon 2020 in terms of emissions reduction and increase of green electricity influence as well the anticipation of carbon price. The use of the prospective model POLES allows analysing these different configurations of the carbon market and establishing a number of possible scenarios for the carbon price. Additionally, certain measures for the reduction of carbon price volatility are recommended. The modelling exercises with POLES model enable likewise the analysis of European electricity mix in the long term under the uncertainty of carbon constraint. The modelling exercises show therefore that it is possible to have a less emitting electricity mix in the future, the remaining challenge is to construct an organisational and institutional framework capable to stimulate the necessary investments in the near future.

"Long term modelling of residential energy consumption is most often realised by two kinds of models : engineering and economic. The former have the ability to precisely depict the energy demand infrastructure in a technical way but generally lack a necessary level of realism concerning households' behaviours when facing changes of economical context. The research undertaken during this thesis explains how elements of behavioural realism have been implemented in an engineering model of housing space heating consumption in order to combine both technical explicitness and behavioural realism. Results highlight the elasticity of space heating consumption with respect to a number of variables including technical performance, allowing the estimation of the rebound effect phenomenon at a national scale. The second part of the research is dedicated to the techno-economic modelling of households' energy efficient equipment investments. The results obtained from the model enabled the quantification of energy efficiency barriers concerning the main types of housing refurbishment and heating systems. Other results depict how market heterogeneity can be introduced in techno-economic models. These elements were implemented into a prospective model (BEUS), wich was developed during the thesis. Simulation results show that the increase of behavioural realism of engineering models makes it even more difficult to reach mid- and long-term national energy and climate policies targets. Finally, a discussion is proposed on the topic of energy tier-pricing and its fiscal equivalent - a bonus-malus on energy consumption - based on BEUS results. "

"This dissertation had two objectives. First, we wanted to adopt an original approach regarding our literature review, by analyzing the results of six sub-categories of researches we had identified on the topic of voluntary disclosure in annual reports. This literature review shows that the results that were found in these researches can be specific to these sub-categories. Second, as most previous studies had examined the extent of voluntary disclosure in annual reports using a cross-sectional approach and only one operational definition for the measurement of the disclosure levels, we wanted to know if the results in this kind of studies would be stable if two different operational definitions were used in order to measure the disclosure levels and if a longitudinal approach was adopted. The findings of our own study show that the results do not depend on the measurement of the dependent variable (the disclosure levels), but that, conversely, it can exist some differences regarding these results according to the characteristics of the samples and the year that are observed. Thus, the second main conclusion of our dissertation is that a longitudinal approach is more informative than a cross-sectional approach and that it generates more robust results. This conclusion is in line with the conclusion of the methodological review that was conducted by Ball and Foster (1982) twenty years ago"

"This thesis deals with environmental services, in the domain of upkeep and management of rural areas, from a service economics perspective. After having defined those environmental services, we show the different 'institutional sectors' in which the production of these services is organized. Then, in the absence of a statistical source which can be used for environmental services, we present an inventory of these services in three rural territories. It shows that the local authorities, and not the agriculturalists, are main producers of those services. Finally, a specific analysis of the role of 'institutional sectors' is conducted through three case studies: the first is about agri-environmental policy (the 'prime à l'herbe'), the second concerns a social integration structure and the last deals with a local development action focused on environmental services.

This thesis has for object the evolution of the economic optimum in the electric industry under spatial equity constraint that present a strong spatial heterogeneity of its supply conditions. One analyses the evolution of the rural electrification regime in France both in terms of economic and social efficiency. We examine the rationality of extending the sectoral optimization under equity constraint to the rationalization of electricity end-uses in the heterogeneous space of rural electricity supply. To this question are given two responses. The firsts pertains to modify the incentives in the intitutional regime of rural electrification so the MDE may be integrated in the strategies of rural electrification syndicates. One inspire from incentives mechanisms of the anglo-saxon DSM practice. The second is statistical zoning method of demand and distribution grid whose object is to localize action basins for large scale MDE projects.

"Many patterns in stock returns apparently are not explained by the Capital Asset Pricing Model. They are called anomalies. Size and Value effects are the most documented anomalies in financial literature. The aim of this research is to study these two effects on the French stock market. Many empirical studies on the three factor model of Fama and French (1993) are proposed. From July 1976 to June 2001, adding HML and SMB portfolios to the market portfolio helps in explaining time-series and cross-section portfolio returns. Another empirical study testing the proposition of Daniel and Titman (1997) is done. We investigate two other hypothesis explaining the limits of the CAPM. First, we test the hypothesis of adding the co-moments of order three and four to the three factor model. Second, the hypothesis of a mis-specification of the market portfolio, as documented by Ferguson and Shockley (2003), is tested. This specification of the model does not help to explain the totality of size and book to market effects. The true market portfolio does not substitute SMB and HML portfolios. Finally, the SMB and HML portfolios may incorporate economic information. The three factor model does a good job in explaining average portfolio returns in recession as long as in expansion. "
"The importance of the zero lower bound on nominal short term rates for the monetary authorities in the late 90s in Japan and recently in the United States. The recent experience of Japan as well as low levels of interest rates of Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have fueled the debate on the effectiveness of monetary policy when the instrument rate of central bank reached the zero bound. This thesis aims to analyze the influence of monetary policy when the interest rates are bounded at zero. Faced with a threat of deflation, the central bank has so far not denied, even if his rate has been lowered to a level close to the zero bound. Many recent researches, theoretical and empirical, rose particularly by the economic policy debates around the ""lost decade"" of Japan show that the central banks can implement a range of mesures called unconventional monetary policy to avert the threat a liquidity crisis.

"Money has a paradoxal statute in economic. It appeared to solve barter constraints and once instituted, it has an accessory role. Regarding to this point, the Phongsaly province case (Lao PDR ) is from a major interest. From 1975 to 2000, the local monetary field changed. The rural autarkic communities turn into a market model where goods exchanges are vital. In this context does a dynamic between moneys is necessary for market development ? Our results show that the State imposed its money (kip) through a new tax system. Therefore peasants were obliged to trade goods to pay taxes and the markets emerged. Nevertheless, even if the kip became the ordinary currency traditional moneys kept their role for transactions undertaken by specifics agents and foreign currencies appeared with importations and exportations development, organised by traders. Kip and traders are the angular stone of this evolution. The kip, as a common unit of account, gives a generally shared norm to make the price system possible. Then the sustainable goods exchange system become concrete. Traders organised goods and currencies transfers, then supply and demand have been linked and markets are developing. "

"This thesis contributes to the literature on optimal policy choice. It studies the use of policy combinations to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions from electricity production. One finding applies to cases where uncertainty is such that the risk of a nil carbon price cannot be excluded. A cap on emissions alone may then not trigger enough abatements, justifying the addition of e. G. A renewable subsidy. When considering a transition toward a carbon-free electricity sector, capital accumulation causes complex dynamic effects to happen. We find that decisions taken by comparing the levelized costs of abatement technologies, even including carbon costs, would favor intermediate technologies (e. G. Gas plants) to the detriment of more-expensive but lower-carbon technologies (renewable power), leading to a suboptimal investment schedule. This thesis also studies the effects of marginal policy changes in a mix comprising the main French instruments. We find that surprisingly, adding a tariff for renewables financed by a tax on electricity consumption to a cap on emissions and a subsidy for energy efficiency will reduce the consumer electricity price when the capped fossil production does not depend on the carbon price. The assessment of the French climate policies in the electricity sector shows that overlapping policies for mitigation may be justified by multiple carbon price failures, even if the ideal long-term policy mix depends on the carbon price trajectory"
"Abc/abm (activity-based costing/management) is a new methodology to analyze costs and performance. It uses the concept of activity to allocate costs more logically and gives a transversal management of organizations. Abc was born during 70-80 in industry. But abc is now used in the service companies (banks, insurance, hospitals for instance) and in the service activities of companies (computer, marketing, distribution, human resources, support, etc. ). But these activities have some specificities. They are not easy to be measured. Their final products would be different from the industrial ones because they are intangible, non storable, and less standardized. We can wondered if it is necessary to adapt and develop the abc/abm concepts to the service sector. So, this thesis studies the application of this method to the service sector using 5 issues : 1- do the fact to be part of the service sector has an importance concerning the application of abc/abm ? 2- do the cultural aspects have an important influence during the application of abc/abm ? 3- is measurement more difficult to operate in the service sector ? 4- is the way to integrate abc on the existing accounting information systems a factor determining the success of the abc method ? 5- how to implement change during the introduction of abc/abm ? after the study of theoretical concepts, this research tries to give answers using the case study methodology. So the main case study concerns hewlett-packard (and mainly the experience of the hardware support for computers). This case is compared to air france cargo, axa, banque de france, boots, facom, france 3, france telecom, hopitaux de paris, matif, oce graphics, press sector, snecma, sncf, sogep. The goal of this research is to propose a methodology to successfully implement abc/abm to the service sector. "
"In order to prevent groundwater resources from overexploitation and conflicts between water users, two main solutions have been traditionally proposed : market and State. However, such a dichotomy seems to have lost its relevance, as a result of an increasing implication of resource users in the management of water. In this context, this research aims to study the governance of groundwater resources. Governance is defined as a compromise between the coordination of individual actions and two distinct forms of collective action : collective action for public interest and collective action for community interest. Our study aims at describing the various components of governance by confronting theoretical and empirical approaches. It leads us to the construction of the NAPTIC software, aiming at confronting values and practices, so as to become a companion of dialogue on governance of groundwater resources. "
"Greenhouse gas emissions still grow unabated. Instead of blaming policy-makers for the implementation gap, I question the toolbox of neo-classical economists and restate the conundrum as: how inadequate is economic theory as a mental map for climate change? I identify turning points in the history of resource economics and exhibit a constant trend of forgetting the material embeddedness of the economy. Economists' use of the production function is based on a misunderstanding, as the Cambridge controversy shows that it has no technical content. The cost-benefit analysis, allegedly the only way to be positive, is favored to assess climate change, even if it relies on unknown relationships. Damage function extrapolates shared prejudices; the incessant controversy on discounting highlights the inconsistency of the macroeconomic framework. An analysis of a recent article explains how economics can operate this distanciation from reality: loose connections between the mathematical structure of a model, the words used to describe it and its numerical results leave extraordinary space for interpretation. I then explore the relationship between the economy, economics and ideology through the study of two symbols: the homo economicus and the market. The peculier status of economics and the economy in Western societies is traced back to the 18th century. The current prominence of the market enhances the inadequacy of economic theory to address climate change. The sociological phenomenon of climate-skepticism and the failed construction of carbon markets can be seen as impediments to mitigation induced by the market mentality. "

"Given the share of the residential sector in households' energy consumption, residential energy retrofitting is a burning issue in the climate change policy strategy. All the investment barriers faced by households invite us to explore the investment factors and to assess the efficiency of public policies. In a first part, the thesis studies the investment factors by estimating a discrete choice model on data from the French annual ""Energy Management"" survey conducted by Ademe, particularly focusing on factors heterogeneity among retrofitting types. A second part of the thesis deals with the assessment of public policy promoting energy efficiency, both from the demand and the supply sides of the energy efficiency markets. Regarding the demand side, the thesis uses two complementary methods: an ex-post econometric study focuses on the French tax credit called Credit d'lmpot Developpement Durable implemented in 2005 while an ex-ante study uses a hybrid energy-economy model to compare different policies. Regarding the supply side, given the high degree of concentration on the energy efficiency markets, we use a theoretical model to assess public policy efficiency in the presence of three markets imperfections: the negative externality linked to C02 and the imperfections of market competition and information inducing price-quality discrimination.

"The use of poor selective gears in a multi-species and multi-size ecosystem induces desired joint productions corresponding to by-catches and unwanted joint productions that are discarded. These joint- productions can worsen external effects consequences and they complicate moreover classical right-based solutions to fisheries management. A bio-economic analysis of production process using low selective gear is presented in the first part of the thesis with an application to the Nephrops trawl fishery in the bay of Biscay. The production function is spilt into a catch function and a sorting function. The analysis of the catch function highlights that all productions are not joint productions. There is a kind of joint productions control by the fishermen that is useful to fisheries management. The analysis of microeconomic sorting behaviours, from a sorting function defined with analogy to the catch function, then enables to discuss incentives to discards. Discards are considered as an output of a sorting task. In the second part of this thesis, we present a bioeconomic analysis of management measures to reduce negative consequences of joint-productions. A theoric analysis of selectivity shows that social benefits of selectivity improvement depend on the level of effort in the fishery and on the costs of effort. Besides, it is shown that when selectivity is not observable, fishermen are incited to adopt non selective technique. A cost-benefit analysis of several scenarios of improving selectivity is then realized from a bio-economic simulation model applied to the Nephrops fishery. Endogenous behaviours highlight the need to combine technical measures with access regulation measures: when the fishery is non selective, access regulation is complicated to implement and improving selectivity without access regulating do not resolve overcapacity problems. The example of the Nephrops pot fishery in Loch Torridon (Scotland) then enables to discuss profitability conditions of an alternative fishing gear to trawl, pot, whose selectivity is observable and that does not produce joint productions. Profitability of a pot metier in the bay of Biscay is discussed under several conditions. Transition phases are analyzed and highlight the question of transitory subsidies to technical change. The need for a spatial management of these activities is underlined in this case. "
"Our main objective consists in the introduction of the spatial dimension into a computable general equilibrium model so as to model as accurately as possible the processes governing agricultural activities location at a local scale thanks to the use of spatial economics concepts. We therefore develop a multiregional computable general equilibrium model where the studied economic system is split up into several regions which may trade commodities with one another. Giving up the classical Armington assumption on imports and exports, we assume that goods produced in different regions are perfect substitutes, while explicitly introducing transport costs. Production activities and trade relations may thus become active or inactive in counterfactual experiments. Starting with the construction of a national micro-consistent social accounting matrix, we propose an original two-step calibration method which permits the endogenous calculation of the benchmark multiregional equilibrium. The nomenclature identifies 3 production factors, 7 activities producing 10 commodities, 1 representative consumer and one governmental institution. The model is implemented as a mixed complementarity program using the GAMS software. Simulations are run with an 8-region version of the model, but successful tests have been carried out with up to 35 regions. An unconditional systematic sensitivity analysis regarding elasticity parameters concludes to a satisfactory robustness. When the neighbouring relationships between regions, the definition of reference points for the calculation of distances and the distance measure itself are successively modified, it appears that contiguity and accessibility among regions are decisive parameters. Finally the study of two stylised agricultural policy reforms demonstrates the relevance of taking the spatial dimension into account. In particular, the multiregional framework permits the comparison of the impact of seemingly equivalent policies which are defined at different scales"
"Managers face the crucial issue of « just price » for goods and services without market reference (in non-competitive environment and with no market price) very early in an offer development process. The general goal of our research was a methodological one : to compare two methods used to assess consumer willingness to pay, contingent valuation and conjoint analysis designed respectively in economics and marketing, regarding scientific criteria but also practical considerations. After a review of economic and marketing literatures, we have described the similarities of commercial and public goods without market reference. Then we have pointed out some divergences between these two research streams regarding the consumer decision process and the role of price in it. After this review, we could nevertheless draw up the concept of willingness to pay, the sole price concept that can be measured for goods without market reference, to intentional acceptability of price. The requisite measure of willingness to pay has led quickly to the choice of contingent valuation and conjoint analysis in the economic and marketing « toolboxes ». The second step of our work aimed at comparing these two methods on both methodological and practical points of view. Two empirical studies, using several variants of the methods, were conducted : one at an early step in the development process of an innovative multiservices concept, and the other at a more advanced stage. We have came to the conclusion about two types of complementarity between the methods : on one part, a sequential complementarity at an early stage of the development process (a contingent valuation study being used as an exploratory tool of willingness to pay very early and being useful for the design of a conjoint analysis study conducted subsequently) and on the other part, a simultaneous complementarity at a more advanced stage (conjoint analysis helping at price decision for product or service series and contingent valuation allowing demand segmentation given price sensitivities). Finally, recommendations to potential users and future research issues were pointed out. "
"Coastal municipalities need to regulate use and cost land justifies assessing and anticipating effects of urban planning, in particular of zoning of urban land use planning document (called POS), on housing and land prices for residential use. To meet this challenge, two approaches have been used and applied to municipalities of Arcachon Bay, tourist site land and environmental resources of which are threatened by strong residential pressure. The first, microeconomic, is the hedonic price method. The bayesian estimation of housing and land hedonic models, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, establishes existence of implicit price of distance to POS zones and their amenities. This price is positive for protected natural areas and negative for agricultural and forester areas, intended for future construction and those heavily constrained by the Coastal Low. The second, macroeconomic, is based on original model of dynamics of urban land occupation system in which interact housing production, potential land supply, residential attractiveness, and housing and land prices. Scenarios regulating urban growth were simulated: their effect, not always derogatory, on prices is determined by characteristics of municipalities and severity of public interventions. "

"Our dissertation focuses on the links between urban form and energy consumption for urban mobility. More specifically, starting from the study of urban dynamics in developed countries, we analyse the ""automobilisation"" perspectives of Chinese cities. We first present the joint evolution of urban form and transportation systems in developed cities. We can thus show the relationship in developed countries, between energy consumption and land consumption and point to differences between urban forms, depending on the countries' availability of both resources. Nowadays, developing countries are motorizing dramatically. The way cities are built could create oil dependency for the next decades. Our case study is Chinese cities, where the automobile market has been booming for over a decade. Examining the urban development that results from the Chinese economic transition, we suggest what the modern / future? Chinese urban form could be. We notice that the motorization capacity of the most populous country in the world is quite low considering its energy and land availability. Nevertheless, the governance system coming from China's economic transition doesn't turn local governments' attention to the conservation of natural resources. In addition, as the central government can't control urban development, it would be difficult to build an harmonious society without changing the governance model of urban growth. "
"Sustainability science is supposed to be the science of integration (integration of scales, of disciplines, of stakeholder's interests). One way to integrate these different elements is to develop sustainable development indicators. Among these indicators, interaction indicators have a core importance because they allow to link together social objectives, ecological dynamics and human activities. This thesis questions the relevance of existing interaction indicators as well as innovative construction methods that have a main goal to develop adaptive co-management tools for biodiversity conservation.

"This research paper offers some original tools to better take into account the specific features of hedge funds in the evaluation of their risk and performance. At first, we expose the interest of the developments based on Extreme Value Theory to analyse and quantify the extreme risk of hedge funds. A backtesting procedure proves that the Value-at-Risk, estimated from Generalised Pareto Distribution fitting to extreme loses (VaRevt), is more accurate than usual risk measures. Then, we suggest a new performance indicator, called Extreme Sharpe ratio, which makes it possible to consider the non-normality of hedge funds return distributions and the investor's minimum acceptable return rate. At last, four models were set up to detect the main factors explaining the daily return evolution of alternative strategies. This last point enables to emphasize the advantages of Partial Least Squares regression to identify significant factors. This research provides not only, some interesting results to improve understanding of hedge funds world but also, new perspectives for risk and performance evaluation of other financial assets with a fat-tailed and skewed return distribution"
"Traditional economic analyses of externalities remain focused on a unique solution to the coordination problem (Market vs. State) and insufficiently study context elements related to the specificity of each environmental problem. Thus, the aim of our research is to show whether and how accounting for context determines the relevance of potentially available management methods. Within that scope, we develop a new institutional analytical framework of environmental problems, combining a transactional analysis, able to identify key characteristics of the environmental problem and to decide on ways of coordinating agents, with a “socio-institutional” typology able to produce a more accurate analysis of actors’ behaviors and the logic which underlie the decision-making processes. We use our theoretical framework to study the problem of water quantity in Charente-Maritime, based both on econometric treatments of original statistic data and on qualitative analyses of information collected during interviews with experts and involved agents. After having justified the principle of State intervention, we first analyze the combined effects of agricultural and environmental policies and report on the effectiveness of some environmental policy instruments vis-à-vis irrigation practices. In a second time, we highlight how the rural social organization and collective representations allow us to explain the existence of blockages, both internal and external to farm holdings, related to changes in productive practices towards a better integration of environmental issues"
"This thesis aims to explore the monetization potential of non-market values in the environmental sector, for public decisions, through the analysis of two examples : renewable energy produced by photovoltaic solar panels and household waste management. Thus, it was necessary to create a valuation weighting factors reference base, so as to convert the impact of quantitative flows (tons of C02 , kg of nitrogen oxide emissions. . . ) into monetized value (euro per C02, euro per kgNOx. . . ). The economic and environmental assessments of the installation of photovoltaic panels on municipal buildings in Paris show a resulting social cost. Concerning domestic waste management in Paris in 2007, monetized data brought forth several interesting facts : environmental benefit of recycling, environmental performance of the SYCTOM incinerators. . . The analysis was undertaken by pursuing a 30 year projection. This analysis served as a reference to study the effectiveness of actions to improve the future environmental performance thus highlighting another benefit of monetization, which is the possibility to develop and analyze scenarios under budget constraint. The results based on WF coming from different studies and settings are weak but preferable to the lack of data which may lead to potentially arbitrary decisions and therefore contrary to environmental interest (secondary effects not taken into account, mobilizing budget for limited effects. . . ). These verifiable results with ranges of uncertainty represent support of discussion around a single aggregate indicator easier to handle and more comprehensible than multiple physical flows of impacts. A wide set of referenced WF accompanied by rules of use and rules of evolution would allow developing interest in monetization in France and thus generating decision tools. "

"Significant evolutions in the determination of the civil servants's remunerations are observed : the introduction of merit bonus and the development of compensation systems. In the first part of this thesis, we show that the merit bonus fall under a greater process of the state administration's modernisation - characterized by the adoption of principles resulting from privately owned management- and then can install in theory a profit culture. In a second part, starting from empirical studies, we show that the principles of determination of the bonus are very different from the exhibited principles ; bonus are not really differentiated according to the civil servants' merit. Then we explain bonus development in comparison to the laks of the indexes' table which provides some difficulties to maintain the purchasing power of the civil servants and also encounters some difficulties to take into account the new work's qualifications"
"The dissertation studies several factors that impact likelihood judgments and decisions in concrete situations characterized by uncertainty. The first two essays study the entry decision in a lottery where the number of participants is unknown. This decision is not affected by the number of prizes, i. E. By the number of winners to be rewarded (Essay 1), whereas it is influenced by the similarity with the previous winners, a logically irrelevant factor (Essay 2). Consumers’ insensitivity to the number of prizes is driven by the combined effect of the low evaluability of this attribute and decision making without likelihood judgment. Similarity with the previous winners increases participation intention because of the Interpersonal Hot Hand Fallacy: consumers believe their chances of winning the next random drawing are higher when they are similar to the lucky previous winners than when they are dissimilar. The final essay shows that, when regretting a recent decision before its consequences are known, people tend to be optimistic about these consequences, provided that the self-significance of the decision is limited.

"The long Japanese recession is considered under a perspective of liquidity and bankruptcy. Instead of pushing insolvent banks into bankruptcy, authorities tried to deal with this liability problem by guarantying macroeconomic liquidity, and on the micro level, through modernization of microstructure credit activity in order to provide more dynamic market liquidity and decrease the cost of corporate reorganization procedures, thus encouraging their use instead of the informal main bank system. They also attempted to substitute transparency rules in place of weak solvency standards, in order to reduce moral hazard and to make their commitment to gradual prudential tightening more creditable. As liquidity can’t exist without discipline of payment, this strategy resulted in long standing deflation, huge public debt, and incomplete banking system stabilisation. The Great Depression is used to illustrate Japan’s situation and to focus attention on the links that exist between liquidity and bankruptcy at the macro, banking policy, and corporate reorganization levels.

"This thesis investigates the market rules of the European carbon market (EU ETS) during 2005-2007. We provide theoretical and empirical analyses of banking and borrowing provisions, price drivers and risk hedging strategies attached to tradable quotas, which were introduced to cover the CO2 emissions of around 10,600 installations in Europe. In Chapter 1, we outline the economic and environmental effects of banking and borrowing on tradable permits markets. We show statistically that the low levels of CO2 prices recorded until the end of Phase I may be explained by the restriction on the inter-period tranfer of allowances. In Chapter 2, we identify the carbon price drivers since the launch of the EU ETS on January 1, 2005. The main result of this study feature that price drivers of CO2 allowances linked to energy market prices and unanticipated weather events vary around institutionnal events. Moreover, we show the influence of the variation of industrial production in three sectors covered by the EU ETS on CO2 price changes. In Chapter 3, we focus on the risk hedging strategies linked to holding CO2 allowances. During the time period considered, risk aversion has been higher on the carbon market than on the stock market, and that the risk is linked to an increasing price structure after the 2006 compliance event. We finally evaluate how banking may be used to cope with political uncertainty on a tradable permits market. "
"This thesis's background is the context of the economic valuation of renewable natural resources with the big game case (wild boar, roe deer and red deer). Its overpopulation asks the question of the efficiency of hunting management. With bioeconomic models, our goal is to analyze the social utility of big game. This one is made up of four elements : (i) consumptive benefits for hunting activity, (ii) non consumptive benefits for wildlife viewing or future uses, (iii) private costs of big game management and (iv) negative externalities from agriculture, forestry and vehicles collisions. All these economic values are linked in a complex way with the temporal and spatial big game dynamics. Economic theory and specific empirical methods were used for each type of values. Non-market benefits of big game are measured with a benefit-transfer in an international context. Spatial clusters of crop damaged zones were analyzed with spatial econometrics. System dynamics models were used to explain forestry damage. By applying models with the Aquitaine region contexts, we found the equilibriums of the system. This work shows modelling limits with high uncertainties. However, all the research produced here can serve as a discussion basis for implementing a sustainable management of hunting policy. "

"An internet survey was done in 2006 to estimate the willingness to pay for the improvement of the quality of the bathing water along the coast of Aquitaine (France), using the methods of contingent valuation and conjoint analysis. At the same times, another internet survey offered internet users a questionnaire based on the NEP theory (New Environment Paradigm) and the Cultural Theory enabling them to discover their environmental psychological profile. From the answers given by people who participated in both surveys, it was clearly established that the willingness to pay for the project is based on the use they will make of it on the one hand, and on their beliefs and value system on the other hand. We model the WTP according to the decision-making process leading to pay, and we calculate the WTP value corresponding to the improvement of the quality of bathing water within the scope of the new European directive. Opinion questions cross checking existing surveys, as well as a study of internet users' behaviour (time spent on each screen, return to correct the answers) allowed to validate the feasibility of an environmental survey on the internet and draw some lessons from it.

"A first chapter deals examines the link between restrictions on the number of physicians and general practitioners' earnings. We show that the policies aimed at manipulating the number of places in medical schools strongly affect physicians' permanent level of earnings. The cohort effect is very large. : the estimated gap in earnings between ""good"" and ""bad"" cohorts may reach 20%. A stochastic dominance analysis shows that unobserved heterogeneity does not compensate for average différences in earnings between cohorts. A second chapter looks at a remarkable point in the general practitioners' population: the existence of a large minority of low income physicians. We show that these low income result from a greater preference for leisure. Their small level of activity reflects one of the advantages of the profession: practitioners can choose to work less. A third chapter assesses the positioning of general practitioners income versus those of managers. Comparing their career value, we show that the total sum of discounted wages of practitioners is much higher than this of managers, even when the opportunity cost of the studies is taken into account. The competitive examination required for the admission to medical schools results in establishing an allowance for the whole career. "

"Does the Management Control Information (MCI) quality disclosure improve the relation with the shareholders? From accountancy regulatory bodies’ expectations, the information qualities are more likely to be reached by MCI in its large scope. Besides, the agency, signal and stewardship theories provide elements to explain the information disclosure and the way to measure it. A qualitative study is conducted to find out a method to measure the quality. Based on a list of items to capture the levels of quality, three indexes are constructed, which validity is then tested on a 55 French listed companies’ sample. Finally, interactions between MCI quality, its disclosure and its usefulness to the shareholders are revealed, and then confirmed on the same 55 firms sample by tests on market reactions. A positive impact of MCI quality disclosure appears, while volatility shows investors’ uncertainty under lower quality disclosure. "
"The upstream oil and gas industry experienced a dramatic technological acceleration in the early 1970's. The relationships between the agents in this industry have themselves undergone deep changes since that date. This thesis shows that a tight link exists between the technological acceleration and the organizational transformations in the upstream oil and gas industry. In a first part, it focuses on the economic theory's developments concerning industrial organization. In a second part, it applies these developments to three types of relations: those between the owner-states of hydrocarbon resources and the international petroleum companies; those between the international petroleum companies and their subcontractors; and finally those between the international petroleum companies themselves.

"The thesis begins by explaining, in a first part, the genealogy of a heterodox tradition called “holist monetary approach”, which refuses dichotomic theories and the classical conception of the veil of money. It shows the proximities of these positions with a tradition consisting in thinking money as a “total social fact” involving far more than the three usual economic functions attributed to money. Recent research works conducted in France around Aglietta and Orléan fit in with this tradition. The thesis also leans on theories developed in Keynes’ wake, sharing with the “social fact” approaches a holist methodology. The latter involves a main focus on macroeconomic analysis, which is, in our opinion, the only efficient way to consider money as the first theoretical basis for economics. The thesis shows then, in a second part, that the themes enlightened on the one hand by post-Keynesian macroeconomics (radical uncertainty, endogenous money, etc. ) and on the other hand by new institutionalist monetary theories (legitimacy, trust, sovereignty, money as a social link, etc. ) enable, when considered together, a better understanding of the euro and of the European Central Bank’s monetary policy. Thus, two questions, both equally important but generally not resolved globally by the economists may find an answer: the question of the integration of money into the economic analysis, and the question of how money is then accepted by the economic agents.

"This thesis explores the informational value of intellectual capital in IPO context. We aim to contribute further evidence to the understanding of the association between disclosure on intellectual capital and valuation of the firm. We defend the argument according to which the quality of informational effort done by high technology firms on its intellectual capital is perceived as a signal by capital markets. Empirical evidence of this research question is developed in the document. Using a Delphi methodology, we define the informational effort perceived as relevant from a capital market perspective. Then using a content analysis, we develop an index to measure disclosure on each prospectus. As a last point, we test the existence of any association between the quality of disclosure, underpricing and survival on the long term. "
"The research of global competitiveness is a construction in which the territorial base of companies plays a major role. The attractiveness and the territorial competitiveness are very present notions in the debate on regional development policies. While the competitiveness deals with the economic performance in the strict sense, the attractiveness acquires itself by a holistic dimension of the economic development. To optimize their performances, companies build partnerships that allow them to mutualize their resources. These links come true by formal or informal networks, in the form of clusters, local productive systems or districts, insuring a better circulation of information. The nautical industry s particularly involved in our research work. . It is closely related to the territorial identity of the region o Brittany and participates in its attractiveness by emphasizing its endowments. Boating and Marine recreation in Brittany are subject to changes in the economic environment. Relevant actors (businesses and institutional) have engaged in reflections and implemented incentives devices to improve their competitiveness. To better understand the effectiveness of the proposed incentives, we seek to identify if the boating industry in Brittany-owned businesses develop strategies consistent with the expectations of the public authorities and by the same, how these same firms assess the actions of the public power in terms of economic development.

"This thesis concerns a relatively unknown phenomenon in marketing that has become, however, extremely popular among seniors: writing J life stories. While the writing of ‘ego-documents” has been the subject of many studies in gerontology, sociology and, above ail, literature, research in marketing has yet to examine its specific components. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the concept of life story writing and identify the impact of life story motivations (flattering the ego, repairing the ego, being remembered, sharing, transmitting, and witnessing events) on biographical services consumption. This research offers a contribution to the theoretical corpus on special objects and intergenerational transmission. It demonstrates that the meaning of a special object is not exclusively restricted to symbolic references that may be lost or denatured, but others that are explicit and inscribed at the very core of the object.

"This dissertation tries to overcome the limits of the existing analysis of the urban informal labour market in developing countries. Based on a survey of workers in Abijan, Côte d'Ivoire, which results in a typology of employment relationships, it shows that no walrasian mechanism prevail in this segment of the labour market. Each of the identified categories of employment relationship is analysed, using standard microeconomic tools. This verification process shows that agents behave in accordance with existing models only when specific social conditions are gathered. This dissertation thus insists on the necessity to articulate standard economic approach with the analysis of social contexts in which economic decisions are made. "

"This work contributes to the analysis of French Internet based labour markets. This empirical field has hardly been explored. More precisely, my study explores how the new media transforms the format of interaction and modes of evaluation in the labour market. Understanding these changes requires to complete information search costs analyses with an examination of the role of quality and qualification in the coordination process. First, I use the tools of Labour Economics and Industrial Organisation Theory to discuss the potential of the Internet to reduce frictions in the labour market. Secondly, I investigate the way coordination technologies built by intermediaries help reduce uncertainty on both sides of the labour market. I show that these technologies are not ‘neutral' and are plural because they embody different modes of qualification of work. "

"Biofuels are being extensively developed around the world thanks to the support of states, which is a necessary condition for their production. Thus, the focus of this dissertation is to study the regulation of biofuel policies. More precisely, this work intends to enlighten the strong links between biofuel and agricultural policies. Policies directed to biofuel production have changed dramatically over the past three years, evolving from the status of a secondary policy within agricultural policies to the position of a central policy at the crossroads of agricultural, environmental and energy policies. The work exposed in this dissertation is divided in three parts. First, the reasons that have led to the sudden development of biofuels are presented. Then, in a second part, the interactions of biofuel policies with the present agricultural policies are dealt with. The aim of this second part is to assess the extent to which these policies ought to be amended in order to account for the growing importance of energy crops in the total agricultural production. Finally, the third part focuses on the new regulatory framework imposed by the dual production of the agricultural sector (an environmental good and an agricultural commodity): a Common Agency setting is chosen to address this issue. Moreover, this last part strives to anticipate the future reforms of the CAP, in which the dual regulation (at the EU and Member State levels) calls for a new framework for policy analysis. Hence, the common thread of all the ideas developed in this dissertation is the mutual interactions that exist between biofuel and agricultural policies. Biofuel policies have emerged thanks to the 8 reform of the CAP in 1992, are now an important player of the present CAP and will undoubtedly be a central issue in the future reforms of agricultural policies.

"In Niger, the recorded macroeconomic good performances, consecutively to the implementation of the strategic document of reduction of poverty, ask the question of their impact compared to the evolution of the inequality and poverty. This research proposes to analyze specificities of dynamic of inequality and poverty inherent in the new development process, from household surveys between 2005 and 2007/2008. Initially, the analysis, in comparative statics, indicates a light fall of the monetary deprivations in Niger. However, some disparities seem to prevail between the rural areas urban areas. Overall, the distribution of the expenditure is not unequal, and the process of economic growth turns pro-poor in Niger, except in the capital where the growth seems to be pro-rich. The second time, the taking into account of the heterogeneity of poverty, through the distinction between poverty chronic and transient, in relation to the vulnerability, specifies more the apprehension of the deprivations. On the one hand, if chronic poverty appreciably dropped, there is an increase in transient poverty. In addition, the study underlines the strong vulnerability of Niger’s households, in particular the non-poor households which have a high probability of exposure to the risk of short-term poverty. Finally, the analysis of the deprivations in Niger is thorough by integrating a non-monetary approach. The results obtained confirm the complementarity of the approaches in the case of the Niger. "

"The analysis of the coordination upon common resources has been focused essentially on the question of the choice of management instruments in order to guide the behavior of the economic agents. Therefore, the potential role of actors’ behaviors, upstream from the process of coordination, is insufficiently studied. This explains partially the failure of some of these instruments. Thus, the aim of our research consists in constructing a theoretical framework able to explain upstream determinants of the coordination. We integrate, in this perspective, the potential effect of institutional and technological variables, and effects linked to the local dynamics towards the strategies adopted by the actors. In the empirical part of our study we concentrate on the specific problem of the sharing of water resource between the farmers and the oyster farmers on the Charente river basin. Based on quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show in particular the existence of macro-institutional and cognitive constraints that reduce significantly the whole of strategies and lead to the preservation of the level of water consumptions. However, our investigations also allow us to shed light on the complex game of the local interactions between the farmers and the oyster-farmers and how these latter antagonise these trends and limit to a certain extent the problem of sharing of the resource"
"Relatively small, entrepreneurial sized firms with a “Socially Responsible Organizational Identity” are being acquired by multinationals at a growing pace. Recent deals include the purchase of the Body Shop by L‟Oreal, Stonyfield Farm by Groupe Danone, and Ben & Jerry‟s by Unilever. I postulate that a Socially Responsible Organizational Identity is a valuable, rare and tacit resource (Barney, 1986; 1991) which multinationals want to capture through M&A. While the impact of an M&A on stakeholder practices of both target and acquiring firms has been researched from a quantitative perspective (Waddock & Graves, 2006), there are no studies on the phenomenon from an organizational identity perspective, and more particularly from a Socially Responsible Organizational Identity Perspective. This dissertation undertakes the case study of the acquisition of CSR pioneer Ben & Jerry‟s Ice Cream by Unilever to understand how the acquisition may have impacted the Socially Responsible Organizational Identity (SROI) of Ben & Jerry‟s and more particularly, which factors contribute to the resilience of a firm‟s SROI. Drawing from the CSR and organizational identity literatures, I propose a new Socially Responsible Organizational Identity (SROI) model which articulates three elements: top managerial discourse, visible manifestations of a firm‟s social responsibility actions and finally, organizational members‟ perceptions of their firm‟s social responsibility. The first part of this dissertation takes a more „objective‟ approach using a longitudinal content analysis of the evolution of managerial discourse (“projected identity”) and organizational artefacts (“manifested identity”). Findings from this section reveal that the shift away from a founders‟ led firm to a professionally led business has had more impact on the company‟s Projected and Manifested Identity then the acquisition itself. The second part of this study takes a more subjective and interpretative lens to assess members‟ perceptions of their organization. The findings from this last section reveal that there are multiple perspectives on what constitutes the nature and content of a Socially Responsible Organizational Identity, thus bringing into question the notion of a monolithic organizational identity.

"This work aims to link up two French approaches to economic phenomena on the question of institutional dynamics: the “économie des conventions” and the “theorie de la régulation”. First, I examine and sum up each theory. Both agree on the decisive role played by politics in the process of elaborating and changing rules. However, they clearly go against each other about the format and the content of these political arbitrations. Secondly, I elaborate a synthesis. I put forward a common theory of convention which accounts for an agent simultaneously following and changing the rules. This theory of action is used to elaborate a general model of coordination explaining the dynamics of institutions. "

"The aim of the research is to study the client's risk management by focusing attention on the management of risk inherent to customer defection in small and medium enterprises that are located in Aquitaine Région. In order to understand this subject, the theory of trade credit, stakeholder theory and relationship marketing theory ave been mobilized. Analysis of the theoretical framework leads to propose a model of research that explains the control of risk inherent to customer defection. This control depends mainly on the following factors : the anticipation of the evolution of customer's needs and priorities, the adaptation to this evolution, the development of customer loyalty and the resolution of the conflicts in the relation. The questionnaire and statistical tools such as : multiple linear regression, the T-Test and analysis of variance, was used test this model and to construct the study results"

"This thesis examines water policies in small and medium towns of the peri-urban territories of Mumbai. The starting point of our analysis is the observation that municipal public supply is inefficient in the periphery of Mumbai. Instead, multiplicity of formal and informal water arrangements organise the supply. The aim of this thesis is to explain the reasons of the diversity of water sources and water providers and the way they satisfy household demand. In order to analyse this phenomenon, we have used the tools of new institutional economics and D. North's research work. The results of this thesis are based on a fieldwork carried out in six peri-urban towns of Mumbai. The study consisted of both a household survey about access to water and household preferences in the choice of water providers and in interviews with public utilities' representatives and small scale water operators. The thesis is organised in seven chapters (an introductive chapter and three parts, each part is composed of two chapters). The introductive chapter presents the institutional environment of urban water supply in India. The first part of the thesis presents the institutional arrangements of water supply (public and private sources and operators) in the peri-urban territories of Mumbai. Despite the multiplicity of water sources, urban households suffer from water poverty. The second part shows how households perceive their access to water throughout a water poverty indicator and presents their compensatory strategies. The last part of the thesis is about water governance in the peri-urban territories of Mumbai. The aim is to identify the determinants of water governance and the changes to undertake. "

"Cette thèse propose un cadre mathématique pour la modélisation du risque endogène dans les march´es financiers. Le risque endogène désigne le risque généré, et amplifié, au sein du système financier lui-même, par les différents acteurs économiques, en opposition au risque exogène, généré par des chocs exterieurs au système financier. Notre étude est motivée par l’observation des différentes crises financières passées, qui montre le rôle central du risque endogène dans les marchés financiers. Ainsi, les périodes de crises sont souvent associées à des phénomènes de liquidation/ventes éclair (’fire sales’), qui génèrent, de manière endogène, une importante volatilité pour les actifs financiers et des pics inattendus de corrélations entre les rendements de ces actifs, entraˆinant de fortes pertes pour les investisseurs. Alors que la structure de dépendance entre les rendements d’actifs financiers est traditionnellement modélisée de manière exogène, les faits décrits précédemment suggèrent qu’une telle modélisation exogène ne peut rendre compte du risque endogène observé dans les marchés financiers. L’idée principale de cette thèse est de distinguer entre deux origines pour la corrélation entre actifs. La première est exogène et reflète une corrélation fondamentale. La seconde est endogène et trouve son origine dans l’offre et la demande systématiques générées par les grandes institutions financières. "

"Despite its wide diffusion in techno-entrepreneurial practices, the business model remains weakly inserted in the management academic literature. If the vagueness of this notion does not hinder its use by practitioners, it fosters academic controversies. How to define a business model? In order to address this question, this thesis adopt an original approach and draws the business model definition upon what it performs (induces, provokes, establishes) in techno-entrepreneurial practices. The pragmatic analytical framework developed in the thesis characterizes three representations of the business model: start-up prototype, generic value creation logics and economic modeling of a venture. The thesis examines how these three representations are exploited by practitioners to explore the market for the technology, to insert the start-up in industrial architectures and to leverage financial resources. In fact, the thesis shows that the business model plasticity, initially considered as a weakness, supports the coordination among heterogeneous actors - entrepreneurs, customers, partners, investors, consultants - in an uncertain context.

"This thesis focuses on the implications of regulations on the seed market. Two kinds of regulation are analyzed: commercialization rules and intellectual property rights. Regarding commercialization rules, differences exist between European rules, very strict, and U. S. Rules, more flexible. Divergent paths have also been taken between Europe and the U. S. For the establishment of intellectual property rights in this sector. Indeed, in Europe only a sui generis right is available to protect a plant variety while in the U. S. Patents are also available. The first chapter presents an econometric estimation of the value of plant breeders’ rights in France. The main result of this study is that the farmers’ exemption seems to have a higher effect than the research exemption. The second chapter analyzes all the regulations and focuses specifically on the research exemption. It also analyzes their impacts on biodiversity. This chapter shows that the U. S. System, which provides more flexibility in terms of choice of intellectual property rights, is more optimal than the European system. The third chapter uses a theoretical model that differentiates durable good strategies and non-durable goods strategies adopted by the innovator. It allows to take into account one of the specificity of this market: farm-saved seeds. This chapter also shows that the U. S. System provides a level of R&D expenditures more optimal than the European system. "
"This thesis is composed of six essays on youth and the labor market on the one hand, and on the use of subjective variables in health economics on the other hand. In most developed countries, young people often face great and increasing difficulties when entering the labor market, especially since the Great Recession. The first two chapters analyse French programs aimed at helping youth facing these difficulties. We evaluate the impact of extending the minimum income to young people (Chapter 1) and of strengthening the main training program for youth (Chapter 2). The third and fourth chapters focus on the unemployment level when young people enter the labor market, analyzing its impact on their educational attainment (Chapter 3), and on their wage and employment prospects throughout their career (Chapter 4) Moreover, the increasing use of subjective variables by economists raises the question of their reliability and robustness. In the last two chapters, we explore how the formulation of subjective questions shape the collected answers, for two variables often used in health economics : foregone health care due to cost (Chapter 5) and subjective health (Chapter 6). Using the split sample method, we compare the responses of several random samples of respondents, which answer to different formulations of the same question. "
"The aim of this research is to discuss the effectiveness of CLC/IOPC liability regime in the field of oil pollution prevention. This study is mainly carried out from a law and economics perspective, although reference is also made to the economic analysis of international environmental agreements. The first two chapters explore the deterrent potential of the international regime in terms of oil spill prevention, from a theoretical and empirical perspective. The analysis of the effectiveness of the regime as such consists in, on the one hand, considering the ability of the international regime to compensate the entire social costs of oil spills (chapter 3) and, on the other hand, to examine the incentives given to operators in maritime oil transport to prevent accidental pollution (chapters 4 and 5). Sixth chapter considers the impacts of the voluntary nature of the international regime on its deterrent potential. The result obtained from this analysis enable to identify several mechanisms by which the deterrent effect of the existing regime could be increased. However, the overall effectiveness of the international regime appears to be limited by several factors that can not be corrected by means of a modification of the CLC and IOPC conventions. "

"This dissertation is devoted to two main topics: the measurement and the explanation of health within an analysis of inequalities in health status. In chapter 1, we review health indicators which are commonly used within empirical analyses and take part in the debate on the use of self-assessed health. We show that there is a challenge to apply recent methodological re¯nements of the measurement of health proposed in the international literature, which at present, lacks in the French context. Chapter 2 develops an innovative method of constructing a concrete measure of health by taking into account an individual health information being considered less subjective, namely the number of diseases and their respective severity level. Moreover, the construction considers several variables which are classically collected in health surveys. Chapter 3 describes, within a framework applied to health, measurement tools such as stochastic dominance and inequality indices, which are commonly used for inequalities analyses. In chapter 4, we analyse income-related inequalities in health in France in 2004 and in the period 1998-2004. The analysis shows income-related inequalities in health favouring socially advantaged groups. These inequalities have nevertheless decreased between 1998 and 2004, this reduction driven by a lower elasticity of health with income and lower inequalities in income over socioeconomic groups. The analysis being carried out with alternative measurements of health, inequalities in health appear to vary quantitatively with both the number of categories of self-assessed health and the distribution of health used to cardinalise this variable. Chapter 5 investigates the explanation of health status in adulthood according to social and family background, as measured by the mother's and the father's socioeconomic status, as well as their respective longevity. Three methods are used. The first approach emphasises that distributions of health of individuals born to a father or a mother in higher socioeconomic statuses significantly dominate distributions of health of individuals born to a father or a mother in lower socioeconomic statuses. The parametric approach confirms the effect of social background on health in adulthood. Furthermore, it shows that health in adulthood can be explained significantly by parents' longevity. To conclude, concentration indices of inequalities describe inequalities favouring individuals whose parents had lived longer and inequalities in health favouring individuals born to socially advantaged families. Therefore, this chapter concludes that in France there is a family and social determinism in health. "

"From an analysis of the international financial integration - taken as a process of internationalization of capital ought to bring an international market of capital - which is based on a double methodology, empiric and historic, this study tries to determine, through times, different factores which may explain the raising of such process. Moreover it underlines the importance of this process by valuing the consequences on the economie of a determined number of country. In the end, it points out the problems and challenges these countries may have to face to cope with this phenomenon. The main conclusion of this analysis is : whatever the period is, 1870-1914 or 1980-1993, all process raises up with the coming of economical unbalances within and between countries. It starts with measures of financial deregulations, and his durability is assured, paradoxically, by different formes of regulations. This study begins with a empiric and detailled analysis of these processes. But it is to know whether these processes brought a worldwide or at least an international capital market, i. E. A perfect financial integration. The answer to this question lay in a deeper analysis of the positive and negative consequences of the international financial integration. Evaluations of these consequences represents as many theoretical measures possible of the degree of financial integration reached by countries. The results of these evaluations show an elevation of the financial integration degree during these two periods. Anyhow, no real world capital market exists up to now. "

"Since the 1990s, the French wine exporters have been confronted with an increasing competition from a few nations of North America and the Southern Hemisphere. The thesis examines the link between wine marketer' quality strategies and the coordination in the chain of production. Research is carried out on two levels: that of transactions governance structures concerning fresh grape, must and bulk wine, and that of the public rules framing these transactions. Firstly, based upon the treatment of questionnaire data and case studies in California and New Zealand, the way in which French and foreign companies manage risks in the supply of wine raw material is analyzed. We show that the adaptation of production to specific requirements leads companies to integrate a significant fraction of the viticultural activity and to make the nature of their relation with suppliers evolve, through non-standard contracts. Secondly, the framing of the transactions regarding controlled label of origin is dealt with, in general and in the case of Burgundy. "
"The classic approach of buying behavior supposes that the consumption value derives from the evaluation of the technical, functional and symbolic features of the product. But, most of recents works use an experiential approach, for which the anticiped situation of consumption or use and the self concept are the essential elements of the comsumption value. This thesis, devoted to information behavior in buying situation, attempt to conciliate this two paradigms until here opposite. The first part of this search investigate the concept of need for information. It results, according to us, the activation of two schemes, the first concerning the product acquisition, the second relative to the anticiped context of consumption or use. Our thesis postulates that a simultaneous representation of perceived risk and complexity, and aversion leads the buyer to particularise these schemes. While the buyer is often described like unstable and elusive, and fully determined by the situation, our thesis applies for the degree of generality of the schemes leads to a relative permanence of the need for information, through the buying situations. The second part of this thesis is devoted to the information behavior through the use of electronic interactive media. We show the inadaptation of classical communication theories to the specificity of this media. Starting from the thesis of the triple interactivity, we applies for a unique interactivity, that with self-even, made of many interactions with the message, the source and the media. From there bears the idea of ""psyche effect"", self reflection of the buyer, when the media fulfils some transparency conditions. By underlining the importance of the prepurchase information behavior, our research provides a basis of reflection to the qualitative differenciation strategy of the distribution firms. "
"The improvement of working conditions (IWC) has, during the 1970s, been the object of both intensive debate and policy seeking to alter the rules of work organisation. This thesis studies the main issues at stake in this newly identified area of social policy. IWC has been especially concerned with the finely divided work tasks of large batch production. The trend in occupational health risks and the change in the attitudes of workers have provoked a reassessment of the effectiveness of the taylorist and fordist methods of organisation. There has been a significant increase in experimentation with new methods of work organisation. On the basis of three case studies, this research analyses the main components of these innovations, their economic impact, their relationship with personnel management methods, and their long term effects. The reasons for the relative failure of these innovations are also analysed. As concerns the framework of industrial rules governing work management, IWC has encouraged major procedural changes : a limitation in the role of law, active personnel policies by enterprises, and a decentralisation of industrial relations. State policy, employers' policies designed to promote greater flexibility, and union attitudes to work organisation, and the workers' participation are also analysed from 1968 until the 1982 ""Auroux laws"". The articulation between the issues of substance (the implementation of IWC) and of procedure (the level and the actors involved in work organisation), has favoured a neo-liberal view of work management. However, the longer term implications of IWC are to be found in the attempts to go beyond the models of mass production. The methods of neo-classical economics, the study of industrial relations, and more structural analyses of work management are used. "

"This thesis has for main goal to contribute in the domains of economics of education as well as the macroeconomics' explanation of the growth process. The thesis is structured in two segments whose include both three chapters. The first part is based on macro-economic side, while the second tends to specify certain visions responds to a micro-economic nature as to supplement interrogations resulting from the global solution of the quality of education. The first part consists in dealing about the methodology in the construction of alternate indicators concerning the quality and the inequality in distribution for human capital. The indicators on the quality of the human capital are set up on international measurements dedicated to the pupils' assessments. From these data bases, we carry out an estimate of their impact on the economic growth. We base our analysis on the theoretical approach of Nelson and Phelps, in whom efficiency coming from stock of education stimulates the economic growth. After this stage, a research in the factors explaining the quality of the education systems is undertaken. Using a macro-economic approach, two indicators describing performance of the education systems are used: the first relates to our indicators built in chapter 1, while the alternate indicator is the participation rate in secondary level. The second part is devoted to the micro-economic analysis in the determinants of the performance of the education systems. Initially, a micro econometric study centered on the school inequalities at the primary school for 21 European countries affords to what extend can be generate the specificity which constraint the analyze for obtaining a homogeneous level of quality and thus a global measurement of educational quality. In addition, by using an original methodology, we revisit the effect of the class size at secondary level for 35 countries; this up to show a variable of the local context in the production of school can influence education quality. Nevertheless, there is room for some countries for driving a reduction in class size. This appears as an appropriate issue for educational policy improvement, as the Bolivian case. While improving the quality of education systems does not find an unique track for all countries, we show that it is possible to make recommendations of targeted educational policy for each of the countries analyzed, this while sustaining the vision's overall economic production of educational services which was our entry point.

"This thesis deals with the French urban land use planning framework (previously called POS and now PLU) efficiency. Besides it identifies factors prompting a municipality which did not have a POS in 1999, to draw up a POS (PLU). Finally it evaluates their effects on land and real estate prices adjusting for the selection bias through Heckman (1979) and Heckman and Navaro-Lozano's (2004) technics. Our logit analysis of the determining factors prompting the adoption of a POS emphasizes the decisive role played by the fiscal and public finance management issues. Results obtained on the Dijon urban area for the 1994-2002 period corroborate the hypothesis that POS distribution is endogenous to the prices of the building land market. Selection bias between POS and prices of individual housing appears less significant. On the contrary, the spatial frequency of POS appears to be independent of the agricultural land market. Otherwise, our results show that for municipalities having a POS, the marginal effect of the POS on the land and real estate prices is positive, whereas it is negative on the agricultural land market.

"Why such enthusiasm for Public to Private transactions in recent years ? This question led us to identify the motivations that encourage companies to leave the stock market and to evaluate the impact of such decisions on shareholders'wealth. Our research focuses on the period from 2000 to 2007 in different geographical areas : the United States, Europe and Asia. It is organized in two parts. The first part is devoted to the theoretical framework. An analysis of the implementation of these operations and their evolution over time are the subjects of Chapter 1. The literature review (Chapter 2) reveals the limits of the French and International researches on the subject, which encouraged us to develop this international analysis. Then, we formulated (Chapter 3) different hypotheses to test, and the methodology we would employ. The second part is reserved for empirical analysis based on the motivations of Public to Private transactions (Chapter 4). These are determined by a comparison between our study sample and a control sample consisting of listed companies. Both consist of 413 firms. The hypothesis of shareholders' wealth is measured by two indicators : the premium and the cumulative average abnormal return (Chapter 5). These represent the dependent variables of our model which examine the impact of Public to Private transactions to shareholders' wealth (Chapter 6). Our analysis confirms the significant role of tax savings, internal company control, weak growth prospects, and under-valuation both as determinants of companies' decisions to go private and as sources of wealth for shareholders.

"Our thesis of history of the economic analysis concerns the taking into account of the individual economic behaviours in the Austrian theoretical tradition, through the work, essentially, of C. Menger, F. Wieser, J. A. Schumpeter, F. A. Hayek and L. Von Mises. Our study initially establishes the original features of this tradition, in the field of the treatment of the concept of economic agent. Thus, one of the major elements characterizing the Austrian approach is the study of the behaviors, through the analysis between the individual behaviors and the social interactions, by the means of the social rules and the organizations. Our thesis then aims at analyzing how this tradition could reveal two forms different of rationality, one characteristic of innovating behaviors, the other of mimetic behaviors and/or creatures of habit. In the studied Austrian authors, the interactions between these two typical forms of behavior are at the origin of the explanation of the emergence of the institutions or economic dynamics. Lastly, our study up to what point analyzes this distinction between two types of rationality can make it possible to clarify the problems of creation and diffusion of the technological innovations within the modern economies. It shows in particular that technical progress does not answer only one purely economic efficiency or a logic of selection, but also depends on the installation of institutions. Our work thus exceeds the framework of the only history of the economic thinking, since it has outlets in the fields of the economy of the knowledge and the economy of the innovation. "

This thesis investigates the importance of normalization and certification for coordination in the branch of training. The main hypothesis of this research is to consider the diversity of certifying quality institutions as contributing to structure the supply side. The theoretical framework mobilises competence-based approach in order to clarify the contribution of normalization and certification in enhancing both internal and external coherence of the firm. The emperical analyses use the database which surveys the use of norms in the branch of training (Cereq 1997). 
"Sociological features influence by several ways regional economic development. In order to study these mechanisms, this work uses the notion of social capital. The first part builds and presents the analytic framework, which is based on the analysis of market imperfections. Two forms of social capital are distinguished: local cohesion (bonding) and outer links (bridging). The second part presents theoretical essays, based on microeconomic models, covering three topics: the arbitration between bonding and bridging social capital, the negative effects of bonding social capital, and the importance of taking into account the agents' heterogeneity. The third part presents an empirical test of the role of social capital on economic performance, in the case of French rural areas. It proceeds in two steps: six case studies and econometric analysis. Results corroborate the positive role of social capital, of both forms – bonding and bridging. "
"This research analyzes the influence of accounting thresholds in earnings management practices. Its contributions are threefold: (1) semantic, (2) methodological and (3) empirical. (1) The research clarifies the terminology and suggests a typology of thresholds. It proposes an additional framework for positive accounting theory by considering psychological explanations and highlighting the importance of managers’ anticipations. (2) The study investigates nonparametric models mobilized in previous studies on earnings distributions. It identifies three limits: the estimating for irregularities, the interval width, and the scaling variable. The consequences of these limits are assessed by an empirical study of French listed companies. Findings call for a parametric model to overcome these deficiencies. This model allows measuring the total number of companies which manage their earnings, and the amounts they manage. (3) This parametric model is implemented to analyze the earnings distributions of French listed companies from 1992 to 2004. Results show that each year, 5 to 10% of the companies manage their earnings to avoid disclosing a loss. Annual managed amounts are estimated at about 8. 5 billion euros and decrease during the period. By questioning the postulate of small losses avoidance, this research stresses the importance of thresholds research, and calls for further international studies. "

"Land-use conflicts reveal the contemporary evolution of rural areas, and specifically the rise of the rural living environment and its confrontation with the other functions of the countryside (productive, recreational and natural protection). Local public authorities implement regulations to organize common environmental resources use without conflicts. But local public choice can not satisfy everyone, leading to a lack of unanimity. Local public intervention inevitably creates a losing side and it is difficult for them to escape the environmental damage by leaving. The inhabitants thus speak out to signal their preferences for a living environment. The conflict is assimilated as a bargaining process to control administrative regulation tools. A redefinition follows in many situations and with it a new distribution of property rights to reduce transaction costs and to improve social net product. Some empirical works provide light on the different litigation carried out by opponents and the main ways to the material solutions to the disagreements. "
"Par ailleurs, il convient de s'interroger, selon une perspective davantage normative, sur le contenu de la notion de gestion intégrée des ressources en eau. Ainsi, nous défendons la thèse que la définition d'une gestion intégrée des ressources en eau implique : un régime institutionnel de ressources en eau intégré (forte cohérence entre politiques publiques et droits de propriété/usage et forte étendue), la reconnaissance et compréhension des conflits d'usage et de leur dépassement et la transversalité des politiques publiques ayant une influence sur l'eau, notamment les politiques de gestion de l'espace. Nous faisons appel à quatre outils théoriques complémentaires: le modèle des « cités » de Boltanski et Thévenot (1991), l'approche patrimoniale, l'économie de la proximité et le régime institutionnel de ressources. La combinaison de ces constructions théoriques nous conduit à une grille analytique pertinente pour rendre compte de l'émergence, du déroulement et de la gestion des conflits d'usage autour des ressources en eau et aider à la définition normative d'une gestion intégrée. Afin de tester empiriquement cette grille analytique, nous étudions le bassin versant de l'Audomarois (Nord - Pas-de-Calais). Il s'agit d'étudier la mise en oeuvre de la gestion de l'eau à une échelle spatiale locale, le bassin versant étant considéré comme l'unité territoriale pertinente de cette gestion. "

"The goal of this thesis is two-fold: to propose, from data gathered on 286 companies using questionnaires, a scale of measurement and a typology of budgetary practices in French companies; and to explain their diversity by highlighting the main determining factors driving these practices. Using an exploratory study conducted in eleven companies, a measurement model of budgetary practices is constructed. Its statistical validity and reliability are confirmed by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. A hierarchical cluster analysis draws out five ideal-types of budgetary practices. Eight internal and external determining factors are then tested. They enable us to develop two models to explain budgetary practices: one based on contingency theory, the other on neo-institutional theory. The findings indicate that budgetary practices also depend on their institutional environment: budgeting is partly a rational myth that helps organisations to establish legitimacy. "
"This dissertation is devoted to the theory of financial markets microstructure. The first part analyses information revelation by prices. The impact of different hypotheses on the existence and informativeness of rational expectations equilibria is analysed within a simple synthetic model. In particular, we prove the sensibility of the hypotheses concerning the noise, which prevents prices from being fully revealing. In a second part, we study the impact of trasnsactions costs on the inforlationnal efficiency of prices. It is proved that an increase in transactions costs is always detrimental to price efficiency. For this reason, transactions costs can increase the value of being informed and can induce more traders to become informed. In the third part, amodel of the trading process in an order driven system is proposed. We analyse in a dynamic framework how traders determine their order placement strategies. On the other hand, bid and ask prices of the limit order traders are characterized. "
"In France, as in many other OECD countries, a sharp increase in the number of Ph. D. Graduates in S&E fields from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s was followed by a decrease in the enrolments in Ph. D. Studies. Important transformations in the innovation processes were also observed on the same period. Our hypothesis is that we assist to the emergence of an intermediate scientific labour market between the traditional academic sector and the private research sector. A detailed analysis of the production processes of scientists and of the scientific careers of young scientists is first carried out in the perspective of labour economics. Then, in the perspective of the economics of innovation and technical change, the characteristics of young researchers’ jobs and R&D activities are studied. We try to isolate three scientific communities: academics and researchers in the public sector of research, researchers in the private sector and researchers in the intermediate research sector. "
"Urban roads which are complex with many forms have several functions as regards urban space. They can be defined as the entire public space located between private spaces. They have mainly been treated as transport network infrastructures since the development of car use. However. Such an approach is opposed to urban territory management by local councils. Which wish a well-balanced development of their city and a better quality of urban life. After having described, on the basis of previous investigations, the different forms of urban road management which can ever be contrary, the author suggests to implement a ""patrimonial"" management in order to respect the unity of this public space ; such a management is meant to preserve the various uses wether collective or individual and to offer a new way to cope with problems of appropriation which are likely to increase with the growing lack of urban road spaces. "
"Based on a review of literature, this thesis analyses the evolution of corporate social (or societal) accounting in terms of a debate between two approaches : the first one recommends integration in financial accounting, the second one, on the contrary, pleads for the development of separate and autonomous forms of corporate social accounting. This research is carried out within the framework of the theory of stake-holders which recognises the legitimacy of constituents outside a company to request information on the corporate use of collective resources endowed on it by society. The element that opposes the two approaches to corporate social accounting concerns the ability of monetary data to give a true and fair view of the impacts on society of a given corporate economic activity. Our field work dealt with the evaluation of the environmental external costs of an industrial process in a major company. It involved giving a monetary value to the physical flows of that process. As such it is relevant to the element that opposes the two above-mentioned approaches and enables us to reach clear cut conclusions as to which one should be preferred. The external costs linked to the physical flows of an industrial process are expressed per unit of product, using three different methods, with three estimates per method (low, medium, high). The major findings of this experiment are the existence of a low number of flows for which a monetary evaluation can be carried out, the wide range of possible results, the lack of accepted standards on which to base calculations. These findings lead us to conclude that the use of monetary data to evaluate and compare environmental impacts is a scientifically unsound management practice and that the development of new forms of social accounting should be conducted separately from financial accounting. The thesis then proposes an enlarged accounting model which enables the positioning of different forms of accounting relative to one another. "
"Since the 70's numerous researchs are dealing with entrepreneurship and new firm creation. The first part of this work presents epistemological and methodological contributions on entrepreneurship and new firm creation. Much attention is devoted to the definition of the concepts. In the second part, a model of the process of new firm creation is developed in the contructivist paradigm and in the entrepreneurship field with the perpective of helping new firm founders. "
"This thesis looks for robustness in climate change mitigation policies assessment and implementation. Exploring the uncertainties surrounding future technologies, fossil fuel resources, policy instruments, consumption preferences, population and economie growth with an Integrated Assessment model, it disentangles the future drivers of future carbon emissions and of mitigation costs. Such methodologies improve the understanding of models, filter out the issues that do not really matter, help policymakers focus on critical factors and develop consensus about where the focus should be. The thesis also proposes to focus on instruments that are robust to political constraints thanks to their lower short-term impacts. Such instruments include performance standards or financial instruments that redirect the bulk of investments towards clean capital without affecting the owners of existing polluting capital. "
"The research aims to understand the appropriation and the perception of ISO 9001 by employees and its influence on their attitude in favour of the control of organizational activity. Quality management standard ISO 3301 is a tool for management control. Based on the process approach to business and continuous improvement of business functions, ISO 9001 standard focuses on employee attitudes. Despite the extensive literature on the ISO 9001 standard, which focuses on the reason for its adoption and its impact on the organizations, the effects of its perception by operational employees are poorly understood. Supported by an analysis framework which aims to explain the appropriation and the perception of ISO 9001, the research explores determinants of the perception of ISO 9001 and its effects on workplace attitudes, by using the methodology of cognitive maps. Twenty-seven interview with representative employees were conducted in four French companies covering all major sectors. The study leads to a typology of perceptions of ISO 9001 : favorable, distances, contradictory, and non-perception. The results show that employees perceive positively the standard and, also, positive workplace attitudes result from standard. The research validates the sequence where management influences the perception of ISO 9001 standard, which in turn influences workplace attitudes. The study concludes that the quality management according to ISO 9001 promotes organizational control. "
"The main theme of the Ph. D. Dissertation focuses on macroeconomic policies. Conducting a ""good economic policy"" implies to understand the cyclical position of the economy and consequently the need and objectives of public policy actions; to have a reliable estimate of the impact of instruments; and to rely on a consistent theoretical framework to assess the desired positive effects but also negative impacts that can be caused by these policies. The various articles or book chapters presented attempt to discuss economic policy decisions on a wide range of applications. The diversity of the issues addressed - macroeconomic framework, fiscal policy, monetary policy, international economic relations - reflects in part the variety of my career as an economist with the French Ministry of Finance (INSEE and French Treasury) in Paris and in Tokyo or as economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. This Ph. D. Dissertation includes fifteen articles written between 2000 and 2015. Half of the articles presented here were published in referee journals or as book chapters, the other half has the status of working papers or mimeographs. With two exceptions, all the articles were presented at conferences or seminars. "

"In the first chapter of the thesis, I study how merger policy affects the choice between in-market and cross-border merging. An insight of the first chapter is that the merger policy should consider subsequent mergers triggered by an initial decision to merge, which here corresponds to the scenario of an exit-by-merger after a failed cross-border merger. In the second chapter of the thesis, I examine the impact of competition between a private firm and public firms on prices and investment in new infrastructures. An insight from this analysis is that due to distinct objective functions, the private firm charges the monopoly price when it is a monopoly, while the national public firm charges a price such that it cross-subsidizes between low-cost and high-cost areas. Local public firms charge prices contingent on the investment cost in their own area. In monopoly, the national public has the largest coverage, whereas the local public firms cover the same areas as the private firm. In mixed duopoly, prices are strategic complements for the private firm and are strategic substitutes for public firms. Competition leads the private firm to set lower prices, while public firms may charge higher prices. In the third chapter of the thesis, I investigate the impact of competition between two firms in prices and information disclosure levels. In a two-sided market, there are consumers on one side, and a monopoly data broker on the other side. An insight from this analysis is that firms adopt two types of business strategies due to a trade-off between the exploitation of consumer information, the level of information provision, and consumer valuations. If consumer valuations are sufficiently low, firms engage in disclosure of consumer information (low-privacy regime) and charge low (even negative) prices. In contrast, if consumer valuations are sufficiently high, firms do not engage in disclosure of consumer information (highprivacy regime) and always charge positive prices. If consumers single-purchase, a merger to monopoly increases market power but is privacy-neutral. With multi-purchasing, a merger to monopoly decreases prices and privacy levels if firms are unable to monetize multi-purchaser information."
"The first quantitative goal for official development assistance was established in 1970, in a world strongly influenced by redistribution concerns between Northern and Southern countries. The adoption of the Millennium Development Goals renewed the interest in quantitative ODA targets. Other goals, adopted during the last decade, added to the 0. 7%, which until then stood for the unique reference for ODA volume. These goals share one common characteristic: their non-accomplishment. It is commonly assumed that the non-accomplishment of the goals is mainly due to donor countries’ lack of political will. In this thesis, we attempt to identify more tangible reasons which could explain repetitive failure in fulfilling the goals. For this purpose, we examine the definition of the goals themselves through a critical reading of its constituent elements: its reference indicator, i. E. ODA, its quantitative targets and the nature of donor countries’ commitments. We conclude that quantitative ODA goals, as they are defined, are not intended to be reached. Their first purpose is to act as an incentive for donor countries to raise efforts on ODA volume. This means that, at least partly, the definition of the goals accounts for their non-accomplishment. It also explains why failure in meeting the goals persists over time: the goals carry inherently the seed for their subsequent failure. Furthermore, they confine ODA into a logic that has widely proved ineffective"
"Together with increased economic and political openness, a location’s or territory’s attractiveness and competitiveness for foreign direct investment (FDI) are key elements for intensifying investment and trade flows.For countries, especially those without a national market of significant scale, establishing a way to identify and analyse priorities for economic development is fundamental.This research defines a general analytical framework applicable to the concepts of attractiveness and competitiveness, and, building on this framework, develops a specific model that could assist key institutions as to identify their preferred orientations in the specific context of an economy considered as a small open mature economy (SOME), in particular, Luxembourg.This research will lead to the definition of a prospective structured approach by:- providing a list of factors which potentially influence the competitiveness and attractiveness of SOMEs; this list having been validated with respect to Luxembourgby national decision makers;- establishing a method for analysing the current situation regarding attractiveness and competitiveness in Luxembourg; and- identifying priority sectors for FDI that could be targeted in a specific location/territory of reference such as Luxembourg."

"Mercosur has suffered poor result in terms of growth stability and trade. This study does not question the economic integration itself but rather the characteristic of the open regionalism that is supposed to guarantee better stability for the region in crisis time. The notion of ""demercosurisation"" is introduced to explain the deactivation of its regional safety net during economic turmoil. We discuss the notion presented by the CEPAL of Open Regionalism in favour of productive transformation with equity and its theoretic bases rooted in the new international trade theories (I). The pertinence of the regional integration process as a stabilisation and growth factor loses ground (II). Our historic-structural approach urges the simultaneous analysis of both growth regime and equity focusing on structural and social homogeneity (III). The conclusions define the main characteristics of a Latin-American productive restructuring with social homogeneity as a sustainable alternative to FTAA. "

"Incentive to research and development (R&D), innovation and price are central in the issue of accessibility to medicine in developing countries in general and in Sub-Saharan countries in particular. This thesis aims at assessing in which way the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is conducive to innovation without hampering accessibility to medicines in those countries. This thesis goes back to the origins of the Agreement, analyzes its dynamics and examines its retrospective effects on national laws, bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements. It seems ultimately difficult to share the optimism of the advocates of the reinforcement and harmonization of intellectual property protection. The profits of innovation are far from being proven. These innovations haven’t resulted in any quantitative or qualitative increase of new molecules against type I and II diseases which are rampant among poor countries' as well as rich countries' populations. Furthermore, they haven't stimulated the research and development expenditures devoted to type III diseases, which are rampant in poor countries. In other respects, full access to medicines is thwarted. The decrease of financial accessibility resulting from higher prices is not compensated by the rise of qualitative accessibility. Eventually, the pernicious effects are accumulating. We put forward some alternative and further proposals for the reinforcement of the pharmaceutical patent protection advocated by the TRIPS Agreement. "

"The Ph. D. Examines the intellectual pattern of the English philosopher Gerald A. Cohen together with the constitution of analytical Marxism. It deals with the possibility to reconstruct Marx’s theory on the basis of non Marxian methodological tools. First it displays the founding proposals by Cohen, who defends historical materialism with the norms of analytical philosophy. Therefore, he establishes a dialogue between two traditions who have long ignored each other. Then, it presents the reconstruction proposed by analytical Marxism, which amounts to refute the theoretical content of Marxism, especially with John Roemer’s and Jon Elster’s works. Finally it describes the move that Cohen both refuted historical materialism and gave up Marxism on the one hand, and entered the post-utilitarist debate in normative political philosophy on the other hand. We conclude that, since the interpretation proposed by Cohen and the analytical Marxists led to a failure of Marxism as a tool for understanding the social world, the plausibility of Marxism to be compatible with orthodox methodological tools is weakened, and the possibility that dialectical materialism is valid, with an unity between substance and method, is maintained.

"The objective of this thesis is to study the influence of financing choices on the accounting practices prevailing in France over the period 1890-1939. The choice of this particular period is due to the absence of accounting standards, which allowed firms to choose their accounting practices with a large degree of freedom. On the other hand, in this period, firms benefited from a potential access to different external sources of financing. The thesis presents two case studies, based on the analysis of annual reports of two French companies, Schneider and L’Air Liquide. The first company relied heavily on self-financing. This financing choice was encouraged by the application of a static accounting system, which remains unchanged between 1890 and 1939. The second one resorted recurrently to capital increases to finance its growth. This choice of financing implied the adoption of a dynamic approach to accounting. Through these case studies, the thesis proves the existence of a close relationship between financing choices and accounting practices. Such relationship can only be explained by resorting to a broader set of factors, such as shareholder structure, sector of activity, and managers’ profile"
"New technologies have changed the nature of the tourist experiences by creating virtual experiences. These virtual experiences, which lead to a telepresence experience, are more and more used by tourism professionals, thanks to, for example, 3D virtual tours or 360° videos. However, few studies have studied the effects of virtual reality in tourism marketing. Thus, it was important to try to understand how these new technologies can allow to meet the tourists’ expectations and to positively influence their attitudes towards the destination as well as their behaviors. Consequently, this research aims to identify the conditions of effectiveness of the online experience of telepresence and to understand how this experience could influence the behavioral intentions of the tourists, but also their affective reactions, their attitudes and the perceived value of the destination.To answer these questions, a literature review was conducted; it allowed to give details about the concept of telepresence and to distinguish it from close concepts. It was followed by an exploratory qualitative study and by an experimentation (conducted with 341 persons). The results confirmed the importance of 3D virtual tours and of websites interactivity to create this telepresence experience.  This telepresence experience triggers positive affective states, it positively influences the perceived value of the destination as well as the tourists’ attitude towards the destination. Furthermore, these three last variables are mediators of the telepresence effects on the behavioral intentions (the intention to visit the destination and the intention to search more information about the destination). Finally, the moderating effects of two variables (travel involvement and visual orientation) were studied."
"This thesis is devoted to optimize the health care logistics which can support emergency management plans to reduce the impacts of natural and/or man-made disasters. After the review of relevant papers, two main gaps have been found in the current studies. One is that most of the researches are not based on real cases. The other is that some main characteristics of disasters are neglected when disasters are studied. Therefore, based on real case scenarios, the thesis studies different disasters (natural and/or man-made disasters) separately according to the characteristics of disasters. Natural disasters may be predicted but are difficult to avoid. Therefore, the evacuation of potential victims and the dimensioning of relief resources are crucially important. A three-step approach is proposed to study the resource dimensioning and the organization of emergency management plan (French White Plan) facing natural disasters. In our three-step approach, the first step builds a framework model to get the insights of emergency management plan clearly. The second step establishes a global model (a linear model) to predict the quantity of required resources for evacuation. The third step proposes a detailed simulation model to reflect the real world more precisely. The hospital evacuation under the guidance of a French Extended White Plan in case of a flood has been taken as a real case scenario to test the correctness of our approach. The man-made disasters and the outbreak of diseases can be large-scale disasters which require a high demand of resources. In this thesis, a model for logistics response to bioterrorist attack with a non-contagious agent and another model for the logistics response to epidemics have been proposed. Multi-period and multi-echelon inventory management problems have been studied. The two models (a linear model and a non linear model respectively) combine the main characteristics of disasters: the propagation of the disease, the relevant medical interventions and the logistics deployment together. The number of patients in different disease stages and the required medical resources for each period can be estimated. The factors affecting the number of deaths and the different medical intervention policies can also be evaluated with the two models. With the help of the models, the decision makers can get an idea of the disaster situation and the relevant medical responses from a strategy level. A logistics response to an anonymous bioterrorist attack with anthrax to a shopping center and the logistics response to the outbreak of H5N1 are taken as real case scenarios to test the effectiveness of the models respectively."
"The coordinated management of logistics in an urban context is complex. Pooling is a practice considered by stakeholders as a potential source of urban logistics performance. Several experiences of urban pooling have failed. This research aims to understand the antecedents to the adoption of urban pooling as explanatory factors.The first part of the thesis proposes a literature review of the research fields. Chapter 1 highlights the challenges and issues of urban logistics and urban pooling. Chapter 2 defines the notion of urban pooling as an inter-organizational innovation. This leads to the formulation of three research proposals. Chapter 3 presents the identification and measurement of the antecedents’ influence on the adoption of an inter-organizational innovation. The use of the Diffusion of Innovations Theory applied to the adoption of organizational and inter-organizational innovations leads to the formulation of ten research proposals. The second part presents the empirical study. The methodology approach is developed in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 shows the five multiple case studies of urban consolidation centers. Nine antecedents to the adoption of urban pooling are validated: relative advantage, compatibility, testability, observability, voluntariness of use, perceived risk, trust, power of partners and public stakeholders’ influence."
"In development economics, the culture of evaluation is being strengthened to specify which development actions could be effective, and thus allows a better targeting of aid on the actions that have proven their effectiveness. Within this context of renewed practices, an expansion of experimental methods in the evaluation field has emerged, in particular through the method of randomized evaluations strongly promoted by the J-PAL laboratory, particularly by the emblematic figure of Esther Duflo. Contributing empirically to the composition of a « scientific capitalizable fund » thanks to the updated knowledge, but still including persistent limits, we set into this thesis about a critical analysis of this method, with the mobilization of some recent French and English economic literature.Moreover, we conducted a questionnaire survey to primary school pupils’ parents in Madagascar, our field study. To carry out it, we used a randomized evaluation that had been conducted in this country by a PhD student affiliated with the J-PAL and whose finding was the positive effect of some statistical information treatment on returns to education towards primary school pupils’ parents. By reproducing this treatment in our study, we wanted to know whether it was possible to achieve similar results even though the applied method varies. It’s globally matching up with the conclusions of the author of the randomized evaluation, even if we use a less purely quantitative method."

"The WIOD project (World Input-Output Database) was launched by the European Commission in 2009 thanks to the improvement of statistical sources on international trade that had been made in previous years. It has led to the international harmonization of input-output tables of many countries. International input-output tables renew the interest on Leontief theory but brought it to the international level. Indeed it is now possible to follow a shock’s worldwide. This dissertation follows this renewal, trying to evaluate the multisectoral and international impact of an energy shock. More precisely, the focus is made on a carbon tax and its impact on unit cost of production. In this dissertation, the focus is made on a way to go through the limits of the input-output analysis by endogenizing technical coefficients.Perfect complementarity of goods hypothesis is the main limit of the input-output analysis and leads to the rigidity of the technical coefficients describing interindustrial trade. Our objective is to take advantage of the littérature on flexibles functional forms to remove this constraint of the input-output analysis. More precisely we focus on the Generalized Leontief functional form as input-output cost function are a particular case of this form. In spite of the improvement of statistical sources, the lack of data leads us to use an aggregate function on several levels and to harmonize our functions using the price index theory. Finally, we study the impact of a carbon tax (20€/tCO2 or 80€/tCO2) first on an european level. A cost competitiveness analysis shows that Poland and Spain are mainly impacted by the tax, contrary to other European countries that keep their competitiveness at the international level. Then we study the impact of the tax on France and on Germany and find a little impact on unit cost of production."
"This research provides an analysis of French and Argentinean aficionados’ narratives about their career of oenophile practices. More specifically, we focus on the discursive reconstruction of these practices which reflects the appropriation process of the oenophile culture undertaken by a consumer profile located between the novice and the expert. To do so, we collected life stories from 14 French aficionados and 20 Argentinean aficionados in order to understand the meaning they retrospectively attribute to their career of oenophile practices. Our comparative analysis reveals, first of all, that the progression of the career of oenophile practices is conditioned by the dispositions activated or inhibited by the contexts experienced by aficionados and that mechanisms underlie this adjustment. Then, the subjective dimension of the career concept allows us to grasp divergent discourses in terms of value judgment. Finally, our results underline the need to involve aficionados in the process of qualifying singular goods through the establishment of responsible and autonomous judgement devices. In conclusion, this research helps to enrich the current debates on legislation governing wine consumption in France and opens up avenues about the development of wine marketing in a context of competitive pressure and transformations of wine consumption patterns."
"The high speed line (Ligne à Grande Vitesse Sud Europe Atlantique) that has been operating since July 2, 2017, reduced train travel time by 1 hour on the Paris-Bordeaux line. The expected impacts are an improvement of the competitiveness of rail transport and a modal shift from plane to train. In this thesis, we are interested in the effects of this new railway infrastructure on travellers’ modal choice behaviour. In particular, we are interested in the quality of transport timetable and their impact on the travel behaviour.The quality of transport timetable is an important issue for the various relevant stakeholders. The total number of trains or intermediate stops are not sufficient for a relevant evaluation. The objective of this doctoral thesis is to demonstrate, from the theoretical and empirical point of view, that the relevant approach must be based on activity programs and not just on transport supply.We presented indicators for a better evaluation of the effects related to the quality of transport timetable on travellers’ modal choice. The analysis begins with indicators that provide complementary information to the standard indicators to a more sophisticated model that are able to take into account the characteristics of opportunities in destination. We directed our research to a disaggregated approach while ensuring the measurability of the indicators.Two methods are presented in this thesis: indicators of useful time at destination and the combined modal choice – schedule choice model. Using the first method, we improve our knowledge of the effects related to the quality of transport timetable with a new module integrated in modal choice models. With the second method, we study the research problem with a combined model structure that explains both the modal choice and the schedule choice. These methods are developed on the basis of discrete choice models.We performed an econometric analysis of passenger demand on the Paris - Bordeaux route with ""passenger"" survey data. We show that the variables specifically constructed for the evaluation of the quality of transport timetable are relevant to explain the travellers’ modal choice.This thesis is organized as follows:In the first part, we present the competition issues in the transport market. Among the different forms of competition, we are interested in intermodal competition. It helps us to understand what is involved in competition questions in the transport market and why this issue is important. This theoretical part includes a literature review that helped us to elaborate our research problem.We present, in the second part, our methods to study the quality of transport timetable: the useful time at destination and the combined modal choice – schedule choice model. In this methodological part, we also present the principles based on discrete choice theory that are the basis of our analysis.The context of our case study, the data and the results are presented in the third part. The advantages and disadvantages of our method are presented in this part of this thesis."
"The increasing growth of health expenditure, accentuated by changes in health needs, has inevitably led to the introduction of a budgetary constraint within hospitals. These budgetary restrictions, denounced by the health professionals, caused a real discomfort within the hospitals imposing to envisage organizational reforms. Managerial innovations have thus become a possible response to the hospital crisis. However, their implementation may be hampered by obstacles related to the structural complexity of health organizations and the plurality of actors involved in them. The literature highlights the key role of the proximity manager in helping to overcome resistance by supporting the creation of a sense of innovation.Our research aims to specify the methods of influence of the proximity manager on the implementation of managerial innovation and its adoption by the actors of the organization. Based on an intervention research carried out in immersion for six months in a Luxembourg hospital, we support the implementation of a managerial innovation, Lean Management, within an outpatient chemotherapy service faced with organizational difficulties.The results of the research highlight the influence of the local manager on the adoption of managerial innovation and reveal factors that moderate the ability to mobilize these levers. Structural adjustments and the introduction of managerial support for the manager's autonomy support his missions to deploy innovation"
"An attempt to conceptualize and to propose a definition of online consumer reviews (chapter 1) leads to an interest in the effects of one of the online consumer review characteristics, color. The analysis of the academic literature on the influence of color leads to the proposition of a conceptual framework of the possible impacts of background color on the context of online consumer reviews (chapter 2). The objective of this research is to examine the potential effects of the perceived valence of the background color (red - negative; green - positive) of online consumer reviews (negative or positive) on the evaluations and intentions of the viewing consumers.The empirical phase of this research is based on three experimental studies. A first study examines the influence of a negative valence background color (red) for a negative online consumer review on viewer evaluations (chapter 3). A second experimental study investigates the role of the perceived valence of color as an influencing mechanism in online consumer reviews (chapter 4). The research for greater ecological validity leads to a third experimental study. Participants are exposed to several reviews simultaneously on a model page of online consumer reviews (chapter 5). This research presents a series of contributions for use by academics as well as practitioners (conclusion)."
"Microfinance is a way for helping poor people and it is used to give financial services to a part of the population excluded from formal bank   system, short of guarantee that may lead to risk of default. To this end, to continue their activities in a sustainable way the MFI must ensure economic or financial performance while respecting their social objectives to grant loans to the greatest number of poor. In this way, the questions about economical, financial and social performance of microcredit organization are essential. The economic performance is the profitability of economic asset (equity and financial debt); the financial performance focuses on the return on equity, while social   performance is understood in terms of supply credit. The research has concerned WAEMU and BRICS (with exception of Russia) during a period of 16 years. The data is processed by the Stata11 software using panel data econometrics. Following the different regressions we get a correlation between social performance and debt variable (positive), equity (positive), portfolio quality (negative) and economic performance (negative).The financial performance is positively correlated with active customers,  the saving volume and subsidies and is negatively correlated with  portfolio at risk. The economic performance is correlated with the active customers (positively), the volume of subsidies (positively) and the portfolio at risk (negatively). Following these results, suggestions were done to permit MFI to achieve the set objectives."
"Mobility has become an important issue and a major objective of public policies in favour of poor households. Research has largely shown that people who are far away from employment are also far away in a purely spatial way. Often distant from employment areas, with greater financial insecurity, the poorest have greater difficulty in finding employment, getting to their workplaces, accessing public services or local amenities. Some of the literature focused on explaining this spatial segregation; others on showing its negative consequences and the vicious circles in which it locked in poor people; and a third on analysing ways to reduce.This thesis aims to shed specific light on mobility aids provided to disadvantaged households. These aids were developed in France mainly since the 1990s. Although they take various forms, they share the same objective: to promote the spatial mobility of poor households through easier access to individual or public transport. Their implementation is essentially local. There is little litterature that tried to measure the consequences of the development of these aids. This thesis aims to shed particular light on this point. First, we propose a study of the development of these aids since the 1980s and especially the 1990s, based on a national impetus, but with very varied local applications. We seek to measure how these aids have been able to interact both with the national social assistance system and with other local aids. We show that these aids may have contributed to reinforcing the threshold effects and poverty traps that were specific to the RMI mechanism and that led to its replacement by the RSA. We also show the RSA major reform of national social assistance has had an impact on local aid and specifically on transport aids. The second chapter focuses on an aspect forgotten in Chapter 1, that of the non-take-up of social assistance. The originality of our work is to look at a specific aid to transport (the “Forfait Gratuité Transport” in Ile de France) and to study the non-take-up of this aid by integrating a double spatial dimension: first of all, the distance between the beneficiaries and the public transport network, which may explain a lower use. The next issue is the influence of the geographical environment and in particular the networks effects on the knowledge and demand for such assistance. The last two chapters propose experimental evaluations of mobility aids aimed at young people who have left the school system and are neither in training nor in employment (NEETs). For these young people, mobility is central to their professional and social integration. We first evaluate sixteen different actions proposed by different actors to promote mobility. We show a positive but contrasting effect: low intensity aids have less effect than high intensity aids. This observation is largely confirmed in the fourth chapter, which evaluates the experimentation of the “Service Militaire Volontaire”. The selected young people receive general and vocational training as well as driving licence preparation. This extremely intensive system, where young people are supervised by soldiers, gives impressive results in terms of professional integration and, above all, in terms of obtaining a driving licence. For mobility support policies to be effective, both on mobility and integration, we can conclude that it is better to concentrate resources on the most vulnerable"
"Although the human factor is at the heart of the organization's competitive advantage (Gond and Mignonac, 2002) and unlike industrial psychology, the field of Human Resources Management has made little use of the issue of emotions at work. Indeed, emotions remain a relatively new subject in the theoretical corpus of HRM (Allouche, 2012). At the same time, many researchers point out that leadership is one of the most important factors in performance, which is concerned with the management of emotions at work. This is why organizations now require leaders not only technical and cognitive skills (George and Brief, 1996) but also emotional competencies (Mikolajczak et al., 2014; Kotsou, 2016). In this sense, our doctoral research mobilizes a diversity of theoretical frameworks to explore and understand the extent and manner in which leaders' emotional competencies influence leadership. Our research took the form of an empirical study involving 60 semi-directive interviews with executives in ""leadership positions"", belonging to diversified sectors of activity and hierarchical levels. Regarding data analysis, we opted for an automated thematic analysis using NVivo 12 software and also chose to mobilize anchored theorization (Paillé, 1996). Our interviews allowed us to highlight leaders' perceptions and practices regarding the mobilization of emotional competencies in the exercise of their leadership. Our research's main contributions are, on the one hand, the highlighting, through our results, of an empirical grid structuring the influence process of emotional competencies on dimensions of leadership effectiveness. On the other hand, in the proposal of a modeling of emotional leadership, integrating an emotional leader's competencies, his main characteristics, the determinants of emotional style, his effectiveness dimensions and finally, the conditions for mobilizing this leadership style."
"The increasing societal awareness and the intensification of the regulation make henceforth strategic environmental issues for pollutant sites. Included within the scope of the CSR, this thesis aims to understand the management decision of environmental risks within risky sites located in French densely populated coastal areas. It analyses the ways of evaluating, managing and communicating about environmental risks, also called “industrialo-environmental risks” (IER), and identifies motivations and difficulties of these actions as described by managers. The research is based on a multidisciplinary theoretical framework: the work on the individual decision under risk, the stakeholder theory, and the neo-institutionalism. The research methodology is divided into two times: a qualitative study of 19 interviews with textual analysis, and a survey of 196 sites by questionnaire. Results emphasize that, despite a collective awareness of environmental issues, IER have been significantly managed since only a decade. If regulatory stakeholders and leaders' values primarily guide risky sites towards a more ""responsible"" management, the complexity of regulation and the lack of information explain the slowing of environmental initiatives (EMS, EMAS eco-audit, partnerships). The surveyed sites adopt reactive approaches of regulatory compliance. Costs, lack of human and financial resources, and the low perception of the immediate benefits are considered as barriers to the pursuit of more ambitious environmental activities. Thus, the IER management appears more as a way to legitimize and sustain activities as an economic advantage."
"The thesis investigates the generative power of knowledge structuration for innovative design. Analyzing the generativity of non-verbal knowledge structures - especially, architectural drawings -, this work identifies a new design method by showing that the transformation of links between knowledge bases fosters concept generation. In particular, a restructuration that aims to design a splitting structure - a structure avoiding modular and deterministic links between knowledge bases - has a strong generative power. During collective creativity sessions, non-verbal tools such as sketches, pictures or 3D-printing, can enhance knowledge restructuration: however, three necessary conditions, which are presented in the thesis, have to be met in order to ensure performance of the non-verbal tools used during the session. Moreover, this generative restructuration - also called K-preordering - differs from the classic design exploration by alternative concepts generation. But the two design modes are not mutually exclusive: the thesis proposes a design process that alternates K-preordering and concept generation. This process is applied in two studies, which were led as action research and intended to foster the reorganization of knowledge structures that were both stabilized and shared at the organizational level. In particular, these studies show how such a process helps enhancing the design of transdisciplinary research programs."
"Our interest in temporary organizations emerged from the analysis of a gas storage company that was facing a Major technological change. This change was carried out by an organization composed of a formal project gathering of different companies and by the parent company itself.We found this organization very interesting because of its temporary nature. We asked ourselves, in fact, could we analyse it, as we would for any other organization? How could we account for this temporary characteristic?To answer these questions, our first objective was to review the existing literature related to organizations that are temporary. It appeared that a big part of this literature referred to so-called “temporary” organizations. They were described as systems that had a high level of uncertainty. They were often said to be managed by informal coordination rules that were occasionally influenced by parent companies…These first investigations further supported the idea that our gas storage case study was indeed, dealing with a temporary organisation. There was also a notable lack of consensus among the different studies on how these organizations should be managed. Additionally, this confirmed our belief that these temporary systems could generate unexpected risks because of their non-traditional approaches and behaviors.In the second phase of our thesis, we reviewed the Safety Science literature (the “safety sciences” refer to the theories and research whose objectives are to ensure the safety of humans and systems). We noticed that most of the theories dealing with Safety Science did not address and take into account, the temporary nature of organizations and their consequential effects on security. However, some relevant case studies we looked at, like the Challenger accident or the Mann Gulch disaster, did in fact concern temporary organizations.We then pursued our research by focusing more on governance and safety management topics.Based on the aforesaid lack of consensus, we decided not to use any single hypothesis from our readings. On the contrary, we carried out a qualitative analysis. An analysis without any preconceived notion, inspired from the Grounded Theory Methodology (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).We then did several interviews and field observations on our gas storage project. Based on these interviews and observations, several hypotheses emerged. One of these hypotheses was that the complexity of temporary organizations, tied to their limited time frames, led individuals to sometimes make suboptimal trade-offs between their various planned tasks. Additionally, this complexity and these time constraints made it difficult to identify and assess risks."
"The relationship between unions and workplace financial performance in France was examined. Starting from pointing out the conceptual limitations of the current paradigm for the union-performance research and resultant contradictory empirical findings, the focus of the investigation was to empirically assess a model of the union impact on firm performance in the French context. First, using data from a nationally representative survey which covered 2831 French establishments in all private sector, union presence was found to have no impact on workplace financial performance. However, a new and interesting finding is that when there were multiple unions in the workplace, there is a positive impact of unions on labor productivity and on the level of wages. Second, using a case study, we examined more deeply the process of collective bargaining and the industrial relations climate in a manufacturing establishment. Finally, this study suggests a renewal of collective bargaining in the French workplace which is still much debated nowadays. "
"This dissertation investigates determinants of mobile financial technology adoption and its consequences on individual financial behaviors in developing countries. It is structured around three chapters/self-contained papers. The first chapter explores the growing adoption of mobile financial technology in developing countries by distinguishing mobile money (use of a mobile phone to access financial services) from mobile banking (access of banking services using a mobile phone) and setting Sub-Saharan Africa against other developing countries. The results show that mobile money adoption dominates mobile banking in developing countries especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Determinants of its adoption include macroeconomic factors, outreach of financial services, banking sector intermediation activities and especially remittances. The second chapter analyzes the impact of mobile money adoption on individual saving behavior by using individual-level survey data that we designed and conducted in 2014 in Burkina Faso. By distinguishing saving for predictable events from that for unpredictable events, the findings show that mobile money has a positive impact only on saving for unpredictable events especially saving for health emergencies. Precisely, the results show that disadvantaged groups who use mobile money are likely to save for health emergencies, and that safety and the availability of money transfers within the sub-region appear as factors that may explain the use of mobile money to save for health emergencies. The third chapter exploits the same survey data to analyze the impact of mobile money adoption on the usage of traditional (formal and informal) financial services. The results show that mobile money is preferred for deposits over traditional financial services because of the convenience that it provides in terms of relative access, risk, liquidity and privacy. Interestingly, the results reveal that the use of mobile money brings participants in informal deposit mechanisms and disadvantaged groups toward banks and credit unions."
"The continuous enhancement of computer performances during the last decades has favored a widespread application of statistical learning theory in multiple domains. Actuaries, long-standing statistical experts, notably turn more and more frequently to these new algorithms for the evaluation of risks they are facing. Thus, in this thesis, we examine how the integration of methods derived from statistical learning can contribute to the development of actuarial science and risk management through the study of three independent problematics, preliminarily presented in a general introduction. The first two chapters propose new mortality forecasting models within the longevity risk evaluation framework that insurance companies and pension funds encounter. Chapter 1 focuses on the singe population case, while Chapter 2 extends the study to the multi-population. In both situations, high-dimensionality appears to be a major concern. We tackle this issue thanks to a penalized vector autoregressive (VAR). This model is directly applied to the mortality improvement rates in the first chapter, and to the time series derived from Lee-Carter’s model fits in the second one. The elastic-net penalization preserves the large freedom in the spatio-temporal dependence structure offered by the VAR, while remaining sparse in terms of estimated parameters, thereby avoiding overfitting. In Chapter 3, we analyze lapse risk in life insurance policies through the use of supervised classification algorithms. We apply, among others, support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). In order to compare performances from one classifier to another, we adopt an economic point of view derived from the marketing literature and based on potential profits of a retention campaign. We insist on the importance of the loss function retained in the statistical learning algorithms according to the pursued objective: the use of a loss function linked to the performance measure leads to a significant enhancement in the application of the XGBoost in our study. In the last Chapter, in the financial risks’ management framework, we study agricultural commodity price dynamics throughout specific trading sessions where governmental reports, that contain valuable information for the agents, are released. We examine the potential of open data, in particular the satellite data on vegetation index made available thanks to the NASA, for market reactions forecast. We then suggest some improvements to be considered before an operational implementation of this forecasting method"

We apply, among others, support vector machine (SVM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). In order to compare performances from one classifier to another, we adopt an economic point of view derived from the marketing literature and based on potential profits of a retention campaign. We insist on the importance of the loss function retained in the statistical learning algorithms according to the pursued objective: the use of a loss function linked to the performance measure leads to a significant enhancement in the application of the XGBoost in our study. In the last Chapter, in the financial risks’ management framework, we study agricultural commodity price dynamics throughout specific trading sessions where governmental reports, that contain valuable information for the agents, are released. We examine the potential of open data, in particular the satellite data on vegetation index made available thanks to the NASA, for market reactions forecast. We then suggest some improvements to be considered before an operational implementation of this forecasting method"
"This thesis contains three essays in behavioral ethics. By using tools from experimental economics and neurophysiology our work unveils some social and contextual determinants that affect decisions related to either honesty or fairness.The first chapter investigates how competitive incentives influence the impact of both group identity and the nature of the lie on (dis)honest behavior. Our results show that under competition, group identity plays no role, even when experimenters cannot directly observe the behavior of cheaters. However, participants are less dishonest when their lies directly affect their opponent than when they affect them only indirectly but only when there is no possible scrutiny from the experimenter.The second chapter examines the effect of being continuously informed about another participant’s performance on individuals’ dishonesty in both competitive and non-competitive settings. Our results show that, only non-competitive settings, participants are more likely to be dishonest when we give them continuous information or not. The lack of effect of social information in competitive settings is mainly due to the fact that, when they are not informed, male participants overestimate their opponent’s dishonesty. Thus, when informed of their opponent’s actual behavior, they adapt their behavior and cheat less than when uninformed.Finally, the third chapter studies whether experiencing a loss or a gain in a task affects a subsequent sharing decision. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that losing money compared to a reference point, reduces people’s generosity while experiencing a gain increases individuals’ subsequent generosity. Unlike expected, the level of emotional arousal when individuals are informed about whether they gained or lost money does not explain their subsequent sharing decision."
"According to the report of the European Commission (2011), owner-manager departures lead too often to the demise of the firm. Faced with the worrying growth of this phenomenon, little research has been conducted on non-family business successions (Durst et Wilhelm, 2009 ; Parker et van Praag, 2012) while fewer and fewer descendants are willing to take on the succession (TRANSREGIO, 2005), little research has been conducted on non-family business succession (Durst & Wilhelm, 2009). One of the main challenges faced by the buyer (individual) is to rapidly learn and understand a complex system which is going to be under his or her guidance. Our research brings to light the risk of faux pas which we define as a decision of the buyer which goes against the ordinary working of the firm, without the buyer being aware of it. Our research protocol formalises the buyer’s representation regarding the Business Model of the firm he buys to compare it with the seller’s one. This comparison reveals types of deviations likely to lead to faux pas.After an exploratory investigation, four cases of business transfer have been studied using a semi-structured checklist allowing us to produce a written version of the Business Models. For each case, a systematic comparison of the buyer’s and the seller’s representations allowed us to draw some conclusions bringing to light five situations: shortcomings, discordance, concordance, superiority and different models."
"The goal of this thesis is to study preference for power from its definition to laboratory and field experiments. We construct this thesis around three questions: What are power and preference for power ? How to identify this preference and how to distinguish it from other social preferences ? What are the elements, experimental conditions and settings that have an impact on it ? We define power as a dispositional capacity. Hence, preference for power is a formalized version of the power motive and we distinguish four types: pure or instrumental preference for potential or effective power. In the second part of this thesis, we design a model of power and we test it in the laboratory. We identify the four types of preference for power which is the central result of this work. Then, we show that treatment effects are almost nonexistent whereas we find a strong gender effect. We finally measure this preference and find a strong correlation between pure preference for potential power and for effective power. The aim of the third part is to study this behavior in a decision maker population of the Eve Online synthetic world. We first show that field experiments in Eve Online are a good proxy for the lab. We then observe that decision makers don't manifest a stronger preference for power that other subjects."
"This doctorate dissertation aims at palliate an obvious lack, at a statistical level, of measure of intangible investment. It investigates the notion of intangible investment, its measures, its accounting representations. It develops a new understanding of the impact of expenses in intangible activities on performance in French industrial firms, during the period 1994-1998. It also shows the existence of new dynamics of growth grounded upon human intelligence, knowledge and more generally intangibles, as well as upon the rate of evolution the industrial sectors, and generally the economies, adopt towards this new regime. Measuring the intangibles and their contribution to capabilities of the French industrial firms also allows to assess the performance of manufacturing industry, to identify its strengths and weaknesses, and to compare with other OECD countries. The originality of this study resides, among others, in the use of econometric tools in the resolution of management problems. Intangibles- in their diversity- are taken into account in an original way through the intangible variable, in a Cobb-Douglas production function. "
"This thesis considers a production-distribution system made up of a set of production sites and distribution centers connected by the transport facilities. Each distribution center is managed by a given stock management policy. The aim is to find the best parameters setting of the stock management policy through the whole network in order to optimize the overall performances of the production-distribution system while taking into account the finite production capacity, the customer service requirement, the transport time, and the random customer demand. The results obtained during this PhD thesis allowed to develop a methodology of optimization for the parameter setting of inventory control policies management in the production-distribution systems. Thus, we proposed a simulation based optimization approach which computes the setting that minimizes the overall inventory cost of the production-distribution system, while taking into account fill rate constraints. The approach iss validated by a large number of numerical experiments. "
"Chapter 1: optimal dynamic level risk hedging for a corporation. An optimal hedging of the exchange rate risk for a firm is considered. The concept of the long term exchange rate risk is defined by opposition to the classic exchange rate risk. The optimal hedge of the intertemporal long term exchange rate risk is then derived by the method of stochastic optimal control, in a model where the exchange rate follows a gaussian process with return to the level of parity. It is demonstrated that such a hedge is a-hedge in value, that stabilises the dividends flow paid to shareholders and depends on the level of the exchange rate with respect to the level of parity. The model is rich in practical recommendations for risk management policy in a firm. It appears that the corporation would have to hedge more if the level of the exchange rate is above the level of parity - so as to freeze profits - and to adopt an inverse behaviour in the opposite case. Chapter 2: optimal dynamic level risk hedging for a corporation in incomplete markets. We solve an incomplete markets hedging problem for a corporation exposed to a long term risk of revenue level and endowed with non-exchangeable assets. The incompleteness is generated in the model by a multiplicative and non-hedgeable risky component assimilated to the size of the cash-flow coming from abroad. The optimal policy is obtained by the method of fictitious completion. It is demonstrated that the incompleteness reduces considerably the size of the hedge, as compared to that observed in complete markets. Chapter 3: hedging, information arrival & investment. This article approaches aspects concerning the optimal hedging and investment decision making in a corporation. It is shown that depending on the information arrival timing and costs of external financing the optimal risk management position on the forward market varies from true hedging to pure speculation. The presence of non-tradable assets seems to be crucial. "
"This doctoral research, conducted on French manufacturing SMEs, investigates the relationship between competitive strategy, innovation, and performance. More specifically, the purpose of this work is to understand whether specific patterns of alignment between competitive strategy and innovation influence firm performance. We propose to explore, in three essays, firstly, the influence of strategic posture on innovation behavior, and the existence of strategy-innovation alignments. Secondly, we explore the influence of industry effects and firm's specific effects on strategic posture, innovation behavior, and on strategy-innovation fit. Thirdly, this research investigates the implication of fit between strategic posture and innovation behavior from a performance perspective. The research enhances the scope of analysis of this relationship to the technical but also marketing and organizational dimensions of innovation. Our model, stemming from the rationale of Miles and Snow's adaptive cycle (1978), contributes to further understanding the content - the conditions for achieving competitive advantage - and the process - the dynamics – dimensions of competitive advantage in small businesses. First, results confirm the existence of differentiated alignments between the Entrepreneurial, Engineering and Administrative characteristics of Miles and Snow's strategic postures and the characteristics of their respective innovation behavior, thus supporting the predictive validity of competitive strategy on firms' innovation behavior. Second, results highlight the influence of distinct but complementary industry and firm contingencies on the strategy-innovation relationship"
"We have studied the practice of business experiments inside organizations. Digital transformation makes business experiments practices much easier than they used to be. We have chosen adaptive marketing capabilities (Day, 2011) as our reference frame.Our goal is to describe what enables business experiments and to show the consequences of business experiments practices inside organizations. We have focused especially on cultural change and capabilities improvement. Therefore, we have worked on learning processes occuring during business experiments at a team level and also at an organizational level.Based on exploratory interviews and two business cases, we have brought into relief the building process of an adaptive marketing capability.Our contribution consists of the description of the building of an adaptive marketing capability, through test culture, entrepreneurial culture and the management of the whole learning levels."
"Environmental public policy tools aim to impact consumer behavior. Nevertheless, the causal relationship system between the implementation of a public policy and behavior is full of disconnections. Thus, it should be deepen with the combined analysis of public policies and consumer decision process. Indeed, this latter also depends on others psychosocial determinants towards behavior and other contextual forces. The impact of public policy tools need to be distinguished among them.Our study on the French environmental public policy aimed at acquiring low-carbon emission cars focuses on understanding the impact of public policy tools on consumer buying decision process. Indeed, the attitude towards public policy tools affects consumer decision process. It results that the impact is not so direct but it moderates the relationship between the main determinants of behavior. These moderation effects depend on the psychological or structural nature of the public policy tools which impacts specific relationships of the consumer decision process"
"This research was conducted within the framework of the Caisse Centrale de Réassurance's (CCR) R&D objective - to widen the scope of impacts estimated by its flood impact model. In chapter one, we study the various impacts of a flood and their interdependencies in order to create a classification of impacts. This classification allows us to design the architecture of a global impact model built from linking specific impacts models where the outputs of one model are the inputs of the following one. This approach generates an estimation with a breakdown by type of impact.  It also allows us to understand the domino effects from the direct damage to the macroeconomic impacts. In chapter two, we study models for car damages according to CCR's specifications. The requirements are: the model should be independent from other natural catastrophes and impacts estimations and it should be able to model both a specific event and the total annual load. Through this work we describe, implement, and identify issues with possible improvements of three modelling approaches: -	a simple linear regression, CCR's presently used method,  -	a frequency x severity model associated to the extreme value theory, widely used in the insurance business sector,  -	a model that pairs a physical model with exposure through damage curves. CCR already uses this approach to estimate damage to buildings. Hence, we are using CCR's flood hazard model and develop an exposure model and a damage model specific to cars.  CCR is in charge of the accounting management of the Agricultural National Risk Management Fund on behalf of the State. Hence, chapter three contains state of the art modeling solutions for this risk and description of the designed model and its implementation. A vulnerability model and a damage model specific to the agricultural risk are developed and paired with CCR's flood hazard model. The vulnerability model uses the Graphic Parcel Register database. The damage model is based on the damage curves developed by IRSTEA for the national think tank on flood cost-benefit analysis. Chapter four is a technical document that will allow CCR to continue the development of the global model. It presents a situational analysis of what has been done (cars and agricultural risks) and of ongoing works (business interruption due to direct damage). For the remaining impacts, it presents the modeling issues, a short research review and the conclusions reached in terms of modeling"
"During our thesis we studied franchisors’ internationalization strategies in order to determine the optimum choice of organizational mode. These international developments cause new problems which existing literature does not provide satisfactory answers. In order to propose a new analysis, we choose to use a dynamic approach to international franchise systems. We focus our work on issues of competitive advantage development by foreign franchisors locations and we provide a framework based on the organizational capabilities perspective. A qualitative methodology enables us to define the competitive advantage of franchisor and questioned the implementation of this advantage into international operations. We seize the competitive advantage of franchisor with athematic analysis of franchisors practice. We identified three core capabilities. Subsequently, we analyzed international developments and highlighted the transfer of the core capabilities to the sub-franchisor. Then, our analytical framework allowed us to underline the importance of taking account of the competitive advantage in the process of choosing the organizational mode in order to understand the competitive advantage exploitation in the new market. From a dynamic perspective, we identified two levels of dynamism and we show the importance of understanding the determinants of the development of the second level to refine the knowledge of the achievement of international operation."
"Sustainable development in Caribbean Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) is difficult to obtain because of their economic and social vulnerabilities. This thesis examines the sustainable resource allocation and economic growth of Caribbean SIDS using theoretical and numerical methods, and focusing on interactions between demographic and environmental dimensions. Due to their regional importance, I examine the effects of migration and remittances while taking into account local pollution and climate change.First, I describe the impacts of remittances on savings, fertility and education, with a special focus on intergenerational strategies. I show that potential positive effects from migration or remittances depend strongly on its positive effect on human capital accumulation, i.e. whether it is larger or not than the population growth.Because human capital accumulation also depends on the environment, in the second chapter I study the potential interactions between migration gains and environmental quality. If pollution exposure during childhood harms the human capital process, first there are new conditions for gains from migration which can decrease the demographic pressure on natural assets, second an environmental policy is beneficial.Finally, Caribbean SIDS cannot reduce the extent of climate change, leaving them no choice but to adapt to its effects, however this is costly and difficult to implement. The third chapter of this thesis addresses the use of migration, which leads to remittances that can fund adaptation measures. Therefore, I test whether there is a complementarity or a substitutability between the two strategies and show that it depend on the fundamentals of the economy."
"Tourism employs one out of ten workers in the global economy and is showing very strong growth. The hotel industry is now facing strong market turbulence with the emergence of new players such as Airbnb, who compete with multinational hotel groups. The increasing complexity of the environment requires hotel chains to improve their ability to adapt. The demands of tourists are diversifying more towards experiences and authenticity, and hoteliers are basing their strategies on these concepts and transmitting them to front office jobs. These employees, who must perform emotional labor in order to meet the organizational expectations of a quality service, are prescribed paradoxical injunctions that lead to a multiplication of cases of emotional imbalance among these employees. The same phenomenon is observed among managers who, in addition to monitoring emotional management within their teams, must manage their own emotions. Can a better understanding of emotional labor as well as individual and collective emotional balances serve to optimize the adaptive capacity in these contact teams? We propose an original contribution in the management science literature by linking the balance of the human being in his workplace to the organizational balance in his competitive environment. Guided by Edgar Morin's epistemology of complex thought, we conducted a multilevel and transdisciplinary analysis based on the hoteliers' strategic issues, which are reflected in the organizational norms and in the work roles and experiences of the employees and managers."
"Innovation processes are uncertain: they can be source of tension, as they gather a significant part of a company's risk. Literature does not reach consensus, recommending how to manage innovation via controlling tools. For some authors, it is mandatory to use tools to manage the innovation process whereas others claim: controlling tools are an innovation killer. In this work, we study the interdependencies between management control and creativity and the question of the roles of the organizational context. If controlling tools are not totally suitable, they are widely used and praised by companies to manage their innovation processes. These processes can be compared to an iceberg where controlling tools depict the emerging part. We conducted a quantitative and a qualitative studies in innovative companies and in the social and solidarity economy. The comparison of these two contexts leads us to highlight the essential role of the organization which can generate creativity, the acceptance of an imbalance between the elements in tension which can be a source of questioning and a support to the innovation as well as the role of local managers as mediator between the organization and the field actors."
"This dissertation focuses on CEO’s overconfidence and analyze its effects on accounting and financial decisions. After having defined the outlines of this bias, we conduct a literature review on the CEO’s overconfidence and its effects for firms. Research offers mixed conclusions about these effects. To test the impacts of this bias, we set up an original database and analyze the behaviour of CEO’s of SBF-120 over the 2006-2016 period. We show that CEOs’ overconfidence affects the investment cash-flow sensitivity as well as earnings management. An original contribution of this research is to show that effective governance mechanisms can mitigate the effects of the bias or, on the contrary, encourage them, according to the motives of the controlling shareholder. We also show the fact that the CEO’s belonging to the controlling family modifies the expression of one’s bias."
"The issue of productivity and the ""quality"" of scientific research is one of the central issues of the 21st century in the economic and social world. Scientific research, source of innovation in all fields, is considered the key to economic development and competitiveness. Science must also contribute to the societal challenges defined in the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development (H2020) for example, such as health, demography and well-being. In order to rationalize public spending on research and innovation or to guide the investment strategies of funders, several indicators are developed to measure the performance of research entities. Now, no one can escape evaluation, starting with research articles, researchers, institutions and countries (Pansu, 2013, Gingras, 2016). For lack of methodological comprehension, quantitative indicators are sometimes misused by neglecting the aspects related to their method of calculation / normalization, what they represent or the inadequacies of the databases from which they are calculated. This situation may have disastrous scientific and social consequences. Our work plans to examine the tools of evaluative bibliometrics (indicators and databases) in order to measure the issues related to the quantitative evaluation of scientific performances. We show through this research that the quantitative indicators, can never be used alone to measure the quality of the research entities given the disparities of the results according to the analysis perimeters, the ex-ante problems related to the individual characteristics of researchers who directly affect the quantitative indicators, or the shortcomings of the databases from which they are calculated. For a responsible evaluation, it is imperative to accompany the quantitative measures by a qualitative assessment of the peers. In addition, we also examined the effectiveness of quantitative measures for the purpose of understanding the evolution of science and the formation of scientific communities. Our analysis, applied to a corpus of publications dealing the economic crisis, allowed us to show the dominant authors and currents of thought, as well as the temporal evolution of the terms used in this thematic."
"The acceleration of the urbanisation presents one of the biggest problems of the contemporary societies. The phenomena is particularly strong in the third world. Morocco, live as majority of the developing countries, is suffering from this problem since the society passed from a rural way of life to a more and more urbanised one in less than one century. Therfore we have tried first of all to define the morrocan town , to study its evolution and its identity in relation to the arab-muslim civilisation and , secondly, to study and analyse the logic of the towns'urban grooth from independance until today as well as the urban policies adopted by the state.

"In France, numerous empirical studies highlight the existence and extent of discrimination against some demographic groups because of one or more criteria in a particular market. Most of this work has focused on discrimination in hiring and access to housing, on the basis of gender, origin and place of residence. In response to these difficulties, many public policy measures have been put in place. However, studies to evaluate them on a rigorous basis remain very rare or non-existent.In this doctoral thesis, we are interested in evaluating the effectiveness of three actions to combat discrimination based on gender, origin and place of residence in the fields of employment and housing.In access to private employment (Chapter 1), we examine whether individual entrepreneurship, encouraged by the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron, in his speech on 14 November 2017 on the theme of “Politique de la Ville” (City Policy) in Roubaix, is an effective means of avoiding discrimination on the grounds of gender, origin and reputation of the place of residence on the labour market. We are interested in entrepreneurship through business takeovers. In access to public employment (Chapter 2), we are interested in evaluating the new actions for equality and diversity in recruitment implemented within the French Ministry of National Education since 2014: by modifying the rules for the constitution of juries, raising juries' awareness of discrimination, modifying recruitment methods, as well as professionalizing the competition tests, with a reduction in the number of tests, and changing their content. This last aspect is the main point of the reform of the open competitions of the different categories of the French Ministry of National Education. We are examining the impact of this reform of the professionalisation of competitions on the chances of success in the competition for candidates who are potentially discriminated against on the grounds of their sex or place of residence, as well as on the evaluation bias on the part of members of the selection boards.In access to housing (Chapter 3), we assess the effect of an action to reduce discrimination on the basis of origin by means of a nominative letter reminding the legal framework sent by “le Défenseur des Droits” (the Defender of Rights) to real estate agencies with a high risk of discrimination"
"France, like other countries, seeks to promote its scientific excellence and to increase the competitiveness of its small and medium enterprises (SMEs) by taking full advantage of innovation to sustain economic growth and employment. In France as in other countries, there is no specific policy to support innovation in SMEs but both science and industrial research policies, especially for small businesses, and innovation policies, in which can be identified specific measures to promote technological development and innovation in SMEs. This study focuses on ""how"", in France, such public policies are defined and organized through different periods and it questions the effectiveness and impact of public interventions aimed at developing French SMEs’ innovation capacity. The study is divided in three parts, following a historical chronology corresponding to major stages of political evolution from the years 1960-1970 till now. These three analytical parts are enriched by a case analysis of the French National Agency for Valorisation of the Research (Anvar). At the end of this study, we suggest that France is now entering a critical phase in which structural reforms have to be undertaken in order to ensure French SMEs’ innovation and competitiveness."
"This thesis aims to answer the following question: In a context integrating similar technical characteristics favorable to a reduction or moderation of household energy consumption, within a rental social housing project that was recently the object of a thermal rehabilitation program, do all the individuals display similar energy practices, and what are the explanatory factors for these practices and their differences, if any? Firstly, considering that energy is not consumed for itself but for producing a service by means of the consumption of various energy generating goods, we identified the household’s practices by introducing a classification of these practices according to whether they lead to an increase or to a reduction in consumption. Regarding practices of equipment acquisition and their use, we also have identified practices involving third parties as well as alternative practices leading to a reduction in consumption. Secondly, we identified various factors underlying these practices which we were able to group into four different categories among which identity appears as an integrating factor playing a key role. On these bases, we established a profile for each individual, showing a certain alignment of the characteristics that are either favorable or unfavorable to reduced consumption. Thirdly, we observed similarities between the profiles, weakly correlated with the usual statistical classifications, from which we have extrapolated four truly different types. These strong differences between individuals’ profiles, whose identity constitutes the pivot,highlights the importance of their consideration in an operational perspective. The thesis questions the pattern of consumption and life in our society and opens perspectives towards the consolidation of energy efficiency, towards moderation in equipment use, and towards the enrichment of relational social identities."
"This PhD thesis is a study of the place of public research in the (regional and national) innovation systems. Indeed we integrate economics studies about the increasing number of collaborations between universities and firms, the role of geographic localisation of economics activities and the fact that knowledge is produced in localised innovation systems. With empirical contributions in the frame of the French innovation system, but also in the case of Alsace region, we will look for the relevant level of analysis (regional or national) in which the place of university must be study. We also, study the role of proximity (in a polysemic conception and not only geographic) during interaction between universities and firms. The first chapter is dedicated to the analysis of one of the central mission of university: research. The second is concentred on the role of proximity within innovation systems. In the third chapter we test empirically, the relevance of the concept of regional innovation system by using a particular indicator of the existence of collaborations between universities and firms: the realisation of PhD thesis in firms through the CIFRE system. The fourth chapter is focused on the case of University Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg. We study more particularly the collaboration of this university with private sector. Finally in the last chapter, we analyse the results of a questionnaire send to the global set of actors that have make a CIFRE PhD in Alsace. "
"Over the last thirty years, french agricultural farms and regions have become more and more specialised, breeding and cropping activities more and more separated. As environmental regulation instruments were not strong enough, this trend resulted in growing polluting emissions from agricultural activities, mainly from animal effluents elimination. By using a specific implementation of the contestable markets theory, based on a long term multiproduct cost function, specialisation is interpreted as a consequence of labour substitution by inputs from the industrial sector, due to the long term increase of the labour price. Scale economies were realised in each production by reducing the quantity of labour, while higher labour prices diminished scope economies, which constitute the incentive to associate production lines. But this prior approach is based on assumptions which are not necessarily verified by the underlying technology. Hence, the internalisation of technological externalities, due to indivisible inputs or technical complementarities, is studied through a less constrained analytical framework of the production set. Actually, panel data estimation results of monoproduct pig and cereals production functions, as well as multiproduct revenue function, infirm free disposal of animal effluents. Results allow prior assessments of current agricultural and environmental policy reforms in term of producers' behaviour. "
"The last decade has been marked by the emergence of numerous economic models associated with the notion of collaborative consumption. These consumption contexts need consumers to conduct new activities. This research aims to provide a theoretical understanding of these emerging practices. The notion of collaborative consumption itself is an important part of the phenomenon that we try to understand but doesn’t help us to circumscribe the object of this research. Indeed, the definitions proposed by researchers and by consumers do not allow to identify the specificity of collaborative practices. In this context, we choose to define the research object from a spatial point of view. The massive diffusion of digital technologies makes it possible to link spaces which were previously separate. It allows to carry out transactions that mix elements which traditionally belonged to the economic sphere or to the domestic sphere. This research is therefore limited to these transactions initiated online, i.e. those specific to a platform economy. A theory of science inspired by the pragmatist tradition and a mainly ethnographic methodological apparatus were used to study these transactions. Our study of the website www.leboncoin.fr allows us to identify how this platform fosters the acquisition of market skills without managing to solve the social exclusion inherent to this intermediation model. Our study of private renting initiated online allows us to explore the relationships between users and platforms induced by a more bureaucratic intermediation model. We also show the professionalization of practices. This work allows us to conclude that collaborative consumption is above all a set of narratives that accompany and legitimize platform capitalism and that intermediation relationships cannot be understood without taking into account the way in which consumers perform them and try to transform them."
"The use of marketing techniques has had a strong impact on the relationship between donors and associations. This thesis aims to explain the resistance behavior resulting from the perceived intrusion of associations' solicitations during fundraising campaigns. A review of the literature and two empirical studies have been conducted. The qualitative study explores the perceived intrusion of donation solicitations through a thematic analysis of 18 semi-directive interviews. Three forms of perceived intrusive solicitation are highlighted: solicitations by telephone, at home and in the street. A second quantitative study has been conducted with a sample of 1137 individuals. The results show a clear positive influence of the perceived intrusive solicitation on the resistance behavior. The study also reveals that solicitation by telephone is perceived as the most intrusive. Furthermore, three profiles emerge: the comprehensive, the independent and the resistant individual. Only the first group does not seem to perceive telephone solicitation as intrusive. This research brings added contribution to the literature on consumer resistance (consumer research) and donor behavior (social marketing). This study also confirms the link between perceived intrusion and resistance to solicitations, and thus helps associations to rethink their communication efforts."
"Technology companies are more and more faced to R&D and innovation issues. The acceleration of emergence and evolution of technologies puts a lot of pressure and many new constraints that lead to the needs of lifecycle reduction and R&D productivity enhancement. The first part of this work aims to characterize formally all the actors and their interactions in the complex process of creating innovation that includes R&D phases. We lead to a clearer definition of the scientific locks and raise questions around R&D production processes in an industrial context. In a second part, we made the decision to propose an organizational construction for R&D structure based on proven methods in the world of system development. By remaining anchored in the characterizations obtained in the first part, we focus our construction work in particular on agile methods and on Earned value model. Agile methods are intended to be more flexible and adaptive caused they are focused on actors and deliveries and not onprocesses. Here we use the Earned value model as a management tool for measuring the produced value. After a state of the art both external and internal to the Altran Technologies contractor projects, we build an original framework. This last one defines a list of several principles. This approach allows each one to deploy the model in compliancy with own constraints. The final aim is not to guaranty innovation productivity because for us it seems almost impossible, but to increase, control and measure his occurrence probability. The last part closes the framework proposal by identifying the advantages and the limits, and proposes future perspectives of works to compare the method with some real projects."
"This thesis examines how societies use and sustain the natural resources that fundamentally shape human well-being, the environment and the economy. The links between economic prosperity, resources and environmental preservation are complex and diverse. This implies that, if all dimensions are not taken into account in public policy making, any progress in achieving objectives in these areas can be hindered by undesirable outcomes. A key issue in development studies is how natural resource wealth affects long-term economic growth. In order to address this question, the first chapter examines the impact of non-conventional resource development on the US manufacturing sector over the period 1997-2013. In the same veine, chapter 3 examines the impact of abundant natural resources on the economy by exploiting the volatility channel of natural resources rent on a panel of 103 countries between 1985-2014. Moreover, the extraction and processing of natural resources are often energy-intensive activities that involve large-scale ecosystem alterations. Chapter 2 of the thesis investigates the impact of natural resource abundance on CO2 intensity in developed countries over the period 1995-2014."
"This thesis investigates the relationships between innovation and job quality. Innovation is considered to be the main driver of economic growth, but technological change leads to significant mutations of employment and labor. As such, innovation represents a key concern for recommendations made by public authorities and international organizations. The multiple effects of innovation have raised new questions, since the recent period has been characterized by an intensification of innovation dynamics –specifically, the emergence of new technological cycles. This thesis adopts an empirical perspective, while relying on a theoretical framework inspired by the institutionalist and evolutionary approach. Job quality is considered from a multidimensional perspective, including working conditions, working hours and working duration, contractual quality, and wages. Similarly, innovation is analyzed in its complexity, in order to highlight the heterogeneous effects of innovation depending on the considered forms (strategy, type of innovation, degree of disruption, degree of novelty, etc.). This work provides additional support to a specialized and specific scholarship (within economics) that focuses on the relationship between innovation and job quality. While ascertaining that some innovations have direct positive effects on job quality, this thesis shows that indirect effects –as well as some forms of diffusion of innovation–deteriorate the contractual quality of jobs and working conditions. Moreover, innovation – whatever its form might be – is often associated with better contractual conditions (wage, stability), but also leads to an increase in working intensity and demands for employees.This thesis makes a key recommendation, in the context of intensified innovation dynamics and knowledge – based economic model – however, we also call for further work and improved data availability. In order to avoid the polarization of working conditions and the rise of inequalities, it is necessary to adapt redistribution and regulatory systems so that they would cope with the negative indirect effects of the diffusion of innovations, which cannot be fully addressed by current institutions."
"Historical evidence shows that countries can successfully develop by opening up to trade and pursuing manufacturing export-led strategies. Trade promotes efficient allocation of resources according to comparative advantage, with imports acting as a vehicle for technology transfers and productivity growth while exports are key to relaxing balance-of-payments constraints and supporting domestic revenue mobilization efforts. By spurring growth, trade has the potential of alleviating poverty and delivering better livelihoods. Drawing on the case of Cambodia where the garment industry provides the bulk of manufacturing jobs and accounts for the lion's share of the export bundle, Chapter 2 provides micro evidence of the welfare-enhancing potential of trade openness through manufacturing exports. It relies on propensity score matching estimators to show that the textile and apparel sector enhances the welfare of households in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution, boosting consumption, asset ownership and the proportion of children attending school, while curbing exposure to food insecurity and lowering the incidence and depth of poverty. Based on instrumental variables, we also show that remittances from the export-oriented garment industry relax household budget constraints, increasing expenditures in education, health and productivity-raising investments in agriculture. Chapter 3 adopts a macro approach to investigate the determinants of episodes of strong and sustained export growth. Institutional quality underpinned by macroeconomic stability, a depreciated exchange rate, export diversification, global value chain participation and market-oriented agricultural reforms show up as strong predictors of export takeoffs. Lowering barriers to competition in network industries and lifting capital movement restrictions mainly bolster services exports, while foreign direct investment inflows are conducive to goods export accelerations. Applying the synthetic control method to the illustrative cases of Brazil and Peru yields evidence of higher real GDP per capita and lower unemployment and income inequality in the years following the export surge. Our results point to significant complementarities between goods and services, and suggest that lowering barriers to trade in services is likely to support trade in goods. Chapter 4 quantifies a new source of domestic trade costs related to import processing times at the border that generate supply chain unreliability by exposing importing firms to unexpected delays in the provision of critical inputs, ultimately undermining their export performance. Using the Poisson-pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator, we find that uncertainty in the time required to clear imported inputs through Customs impacts neither the entry nor the exit rate of manufacturing firms, but translates into lower survival rates for new exporters. This effect is heterogeneous across export industries, grows larger over time owing to rising reputational costs to input-importing exporters, and is mainly driven by South-North trade, possibly reflecting the time-sensitivity of buyers in developed countries. It is also attenuated by sunk costs of entry in foreign markets."

"For more than ten years, the development of management control practices inpublic sector gave rise to many researches which some, focus on role that accountants play.The aim of this paper is to understand the determinants of management accountants' legitimacy in professional bureaucracies and to define how individuals, who embody this function, had survived in this unfriendly environment. From a case study at the French Atomic Energy Commission, we highlight four profiles of management accountants: the young novice, the new convert, the chameleon and the king's advisor.The results show that the legitimacy of the controllers should not be studied through his generic definition. Instead, it must be considered as a polymorphic judgment based on manifold determinants. It also allows to replace the individual at the center of the study field of the new managerial practices in public organizations."

"The main objective of this research is to show that service is produced by means of a continuous process. Basing himself on an ergonomic intervention in a mutual health insurance company, the author emphasizes the fact that an organization that completely splits front office and back office tasks has negative impacts, as regards both the operators' activity and the quality of service. This research gives prominence to the limitations of many organizational approaches, stemming from industry, in service situations : they usually underestimate the collective activity. The division between front office and back office deeply changes the determinants of this continuous organizational redesign. The author proposes ways to set new cooperation forms between front office and back office, in order to assure a continuity of service by possible forms of the ergonomist's intervention on organizational project management : the relevance of activity analysis as a source of change scenarios.

"Our study focuses on the André agency between 1929 and 1973, period of activity of thebrothers Jacques and Michel André, architect and engineer. We question their production inits spatial and historical context, in the light of the notions of filiation and networks. Comingfrom a large dynasty of architects in Lorraine, they benefit from both material and intellectuallegacy. This rooting, supported by the teeming École de Nancy in the early century,promotes close networks as well as international cultural exchanges. The André brothersextend this critical dynamic by getting involved in the Comité Nancy-Paris, the Union desartistes modernes (UAM) and the L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui magazine. During the Interwarperiod, they were the first architects to work sustainably with Jean Prouvé, before associatingClaude, the son of the later, to the agency in the 1960s. Close to local building contractors,the two brothers question the constructive value of architecture: they focus on reaching ontechnical perfection and experimentation on materials. This research goes through theirproduction, since their first major achievement, the Institute of Zoology, inspired by FrankLloyd Wright’s processes, to the museum of iron history, symbol of the region's industrialglory. While the 1930s are a period of creativity, the agency develops postwar the toolsneeded to face intense order, in particular postal, and shifts toward a quest for productivity.The André agency thus constitutes a privileged witness to the upheavals of architecturalproduction during the 20th century."
"This thesis is part of the current scientific debate around the economic evaluation of ecosystem services provided by marine protected areas in developing countries. Using the contingent valuation method, it focused on the analysis of the Mauritanian population's perception of ecosystem services provided by the marine protected area of Banc d'Arguin National Park in Mauritania and the value that this population agrees to pay to maintain the supply of these services in its current state. Through the analysis of the results of three surveys conducted at the PNBA (local level), Nouakchott (adjacent zone) and Tidjikja (inland), the thesis discusses the impact of distance, in the sense of the remoteness and the time required to access the MPA, both on the perception of the ecosystem services provided by the PNBA and on the Willingness To Pay for its conservation.In addition, it discusses the applicability of the contingent valuation method in developing countries and proposes some improvements to the survey protocol to enhance the reliability of the results."
"This research work benefited from a four-year immersion in Michelin. In fact, I integrated the company in 2010 as Digital Communication Manager for one year before starting my doctoral thesis as part of a CIFRE partnership. This immersion allowed me to have a privileged access to internal sources of information, which proved to be essential for the construction of my reflection on the subject.It is structured around three main contributions:First, the mobilization of the concepts of the Actor-Network Theory allowed me to bring a singular look on the studied ecosystem. The Actor-Network Theory holds that controversy is a valuable opportunity to describe collective action. Indeed, the appearance of a controversy within a group makes it possible to identify and understand the forces that drive its ""actants"". The approach studied as part of this research work i.e. the MCB Open Lab has known the emergence of a controversy about its value which has had a major impact, both on its evolution and on that of the managerial demand at the origin of this thesis.Then, a theoretical essay on the performance concept allowed us to identify its two main characteristics: its dynamism due to the permanent evolution of the business environment, and its composite character. These two features make it a complex whole that is difficult to evaluate. In this research work, I study the performance of strategic foresight alliances (i.e. ASP). A review of the literature on the performance of strategic alliances revealed a lack of a consensual definition and guided me towards the choice of a relevant evaluation mechanism. Finally, the analysis of the dynamics of collaboration between the MCBOL stakeholders based on theories of social psychology in particular allowed me to conceive a principle of pricing of the studied initiative. I argue that this principle would constitute a tool for steering the performance of the MCBOL. Indeed, its introduction within the group would have positive effects on its performance.For this research project, I adopted the position of “unveiled participant researcher”. Participatory observation has enriched the primary and secondary data collected by mobilizing qualitative methods, which are often affected by information bias.By its ontological, epistemic and teleological components, I carried this research within a constructivist epistemological framework."
"This thesis investigates the determinants of jobs’, workers’ and firms’ location decisions in France. The first chapter evaluates the impact of French enterprise zones on their residents. It shows that this program reduced significantly the unemployment rate of residents due, in part, to the fact that firms’ payroll exemptions were made conditional on local hiring. It also shows that social composition effects occurred in the long run, and that the program increased the share of high-skilled workers in enterprise zones. The second chapter documents the impact of rail travel time on the management of French multi-plant businesses. It shows that affiliates which benefited from new High Speed Rail lines to relate faster to their headquarters reorganized and decreased the share of managers in the workforce, while refocusing on their production activity. The third chapter documents a strong decrease in the high-skilled/low-skilled relative wage that occurred concomitantly with a strong increase in the relative labor supply for male aged 15-65 in France in the last 40 years. It shows that the increase in educational attainment has hidden the effects of a skill-biased demand shift, which are found to be of at least half of those found in the U.S. An additional analysis is conducted at the level of local labor markets. It investigates the spatial trends of education supply and wage inequalities by education levels and shows that a spatial concentration of educated workers and a skill-biased spatial shift in demand occurred in France between 1982 and 2011. The fourth chapter uses the spatial dynamics of wage, labor supply and labor demand to test the “computerization” hypothesis for France on the period 1990-2011. It shows that jobs with codifiable or routine tasks declined more on the labor markets where their share in employment was initially higher, but that abstract jobs did not increase in the same places, like in the US. It then shows that skill-biased technical change affects the spatial distribution of routine and abstract jobs according to the function performed: support or production."
"This dissertation studies how, in order to face an organizational change, managers produce and manage different types of ambiguities (by reducing, expanding or denying those ambiguities). It shows how these managers mobilize complementary capabilities, so-called positive and negative, according to their preferences, in order to face the uncertainties of the change, and thus become ambiguity tamers.  Through a two-year ethnographic study, from the position of participant observer, we analyze seventeen managers, their subordinates and their directors. We show how these managers mobilize ambiguities and negative capability (i.e. the ability to remain in “uncertainties and doubts without reaching after fact and reason”, Keats, 1970; 43) as resources for change management."
"The impact of regulation on the behavior of firms is a subject of constant debate between more or less need for public intervention in the decision process of firms. In this thesis, I investigate the direct effect on targeted firms and the indirect effect on peer firms of law enforcement using the cases enforced between 1978 and 2015 under Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.S. Anti-Bribery law, as a framework. I firstly review the literature on earnings management, and more specifically on accrual-based models, to analyze the efficiency of accrual-based models to capture changes in regulation. In a second paper, I investigate with my co-author the accrual quality of bribe-paying firms and their competitors and find a positive effect of law enforcement on the accrual quality of bribe-paying firms’ competitors, but not the bribe-paying firms. Our results suggest a positive impact of antibribery law enforcement that incentivizes other firms to enhance their accounting information once they acknowledge a bribing behavior of a peer following the information risk channel. In a third paper, I focus on the indirect effect of law enforcement on peer firms and investigate the real economic effects of anti-bribery enforcement on the level of investment of peers. I find that peer firms decrease the level of their investment once they acknowledge the opening of a FCPA investigation in their industry. More surprisingly, I find a weakening in the decrease of investment for the cases acknowledged after December 2004, when the prosecutor used for the first time alternative resolution vehicles to conclude a FCPA case. These results suggest that, beyond the impact of law enforcement itself, the prosecution mode also affects the behavior of peer firms. In sum, this thesis shows that anti-bribery law enforcement can have a deterrent effect that impacts peer firms, who tend to adapt their behavior in response to a regulatory stimulus."
"From a corporate sustainability performance lens, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate the implications of family involvement in the understanding and use of sustainable performance measures in SMEs with an emphasis in Portuguese family firms. First, a bibliometric study has been used to map the relevant knowledge network on sustainability performance measures and measurement field, retrieving 1271 articles from 1987 to 2015. Second, a bibliometric and abstract lexical analysis were used on 63 SMEs. Corporate sustainability performance studies showed specificities of core theoretical knowledge and the greater operational SMEs focus. Third, using matched paired methodology and multivariate approach, we focus 65 Portuguese SMEs from 2012 and 2016. The main findings show a consistent pattern that corporate family involvement influence financial performance but have a mixed effect on environmental and social performance. It was also be provide evidence of positive link between social and financial performance. Fourth, a case study of a sustainable oriented family owned SME shows that a restricted socioemotional view is dominant in top managers discourses and in their managerial actions, privileging primary stakeholders engagement. Finally, it was provided evidence of positive link between environmental and financial performance in a dual managed context."
"This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of mobile telecommunication markets, in exploring how structure, technological investments of players and regulation have affected prices of services; but also in measuring the magnitude of consumer inertia and myopia in a rapidly evolving environment. The first chapter investigates determinants of mobile services price drop in France between 2011 and 2014.Based on a hedonic price regression, this study provides evidence of introduction of a new technology and competition being responsible for most of the price reduction. The second chapter questions howinter-temporal trade-off of consumers selecting a handset and a tariff has been affected by the increasing availability of sim-only contracts. Estimating a discrete choice model based on choice setswhich combine extensive number of tariffs and handsets, it is possible to capture an average level of consumer’s myopia. Results show myopia decreased along with emergence of sim-only contracts and converge towards a value which is close to what has been estimated in other markets, meaning consumers only exhibit a modest undervaluation of future. The third chapter measures the magnitude inertia in repeated choice of smartphones. Exploiting data of handset switchings between 2012 and 2014 of sim-only consumers, we estimate discrete choice models to estimate switching costs between brandsand operating systems. We then rely on our model to simulate market shares without inertia and showthat the market share of Android and smaller operating systems would increase at the expense of the market share of iOS."
"This thesis proposes an empirical and theoretical analysis of commodity price volatility using the competitive storage model with rational expectations. In essence, the underlying storage theory states that commodity prices are likely to spike when inventory levels are low and cannot buffer the market from exogenous shocks. The prime objective pursued in this dissertation is to use statistical tools to confront the storage model with the data in an attempt to gauge the empirical merit of the storage theory, identify its potential flaws and provide possible remedies for improving its explanatory power. In this respect, the variety of econometric strategies employed so far to test the model itself or its theoretical predictions are reviewed in the opening survey (Ch. 2). The subsequent chapters explore three different routes with the aim of increasing the empirical relevance of the storage framework. Chapter 3 rests on the idea that there might exist long-term movements in the raw commodity price series which have nothing to do with the storage theory. This tends to be confirmed by the results obtained by implementing a hybrid estimation method for recovering jointly the model’s deep parameters with those characterizing the trend. In chapter 4 the testing of the storage theory is pushed even further thanks to the development of an empirical strategy to take the storage model to the data on both prices and quantities, for the first time in the literature. Another novelty is that Bayesian methods are used for inference in contrast to the frequentist approaches employed thus far. Hopefully both these innovations should help paving the way for future research in allowing for the estimation of more complex model set-ups. The last chapter is more theoretical as it deals with the storage model extension on the supply side to account for the dynamics of capital accumulation. The key finding is the crowding-out effect of storage on investment."

"This doctoral dissertation investigates how unions may revitalize by moving from existing ‘solid’ organizational models to new ‘liquid’ forms, characteristic of organizations heavily structured by information and communication technologies. More precisely, it studies how unions, understood as social movements or democratic organizations, may effect such a model transformation. To answer this question, we explore three cases of union renewal attempts in North America. The three chapters of this dissertation rely on mixed methodologies, combining interviews with both qualitative and quantitative data harvested from social media. Our empirical investigations comprise one case of union liquefication failure and two cases of successfully fluidified unions. Chapter one discusses the case of a union which failed to renew its democratic model by introducing social media. This failure is centrally attributable to the invasion of the union Facebook group by ‘trolls’, which disrupted the union’s existing democratic process. The concept of a monstrification process is then proposed to make sense of this brutal and noxious confrontation between two democratic approaches, namely the union's existing solid model and the new liquid model realized through social media. Chapter two discusses an original type of collective action adopted by the US Fight for 15 labour movement. We introduce the metaphor of ‘flash mob unionism’ to describe this renewed and semi-liquid form of collective action, in reference to the contemporaneously emerging genre of artistic performance. Chapter three compares the success factors of two large-scale labour movements: Fight for 15 and OUR Walmart. We suggest that these two movements succeeded because they both moved from a solid ‘organizing’ paradigm to a more liquid ‘networking’ one.This dissertation contributes to the literature on unionism renewal in three ways. First, it suggests three metaphors (the monster, the flash mob, the network) to make sense of the process of union transformation from a solid to a liquid model. Second, it suggests different factors which may facilitate or inhibit this transformation process. Third, it evidences the potential for enrichment of industrial relations and organization studies inherent in methodological approaches based on social media data."
"The telecommunications sector has becomes very important for today's society, as it allows people at either end of the world to communicate, as well as it contributes to the growth of our productivity. In order to fully benefit from this sector, a deep understanding of its functioning is indispensable.The aim of this thesis is to contribute to its better comprehension by focusing in particular on questions relative to the competition in this sector.This thesis concentrates first on the competition between fixed and mobile telecommunications services. Indeed, contradictory evolutions are observed. First, the number of consumers relying only on their mobile so as to satisfy their need in telecommunications increases steadily. Second, the number of subscriptions of bundled offers, regrouping fixed and mobile services, has also increased in an impressive manner. The question, treated in the first chapter, is thus to know whether the practice of bundling is profitable for telecommunications operators, as well as the impacts on social welfare induced by this strategy.A theoretical model, integrating horizontal differentiation, Fixed-Mobile substitution and heterogeneous consumer preferences, allows to conclude that operators are likely to lose profits when bundling their services, whereas consumers are clear winners. Furthermore, the increase of consumer surplus more than compensates the firms' profit losses, such that social welfare increases.Fixed-Mobile substitution is also at the core of the second chapter. Its aim is to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of about 20.000 French users that explain best the users' choice of subscribing either to only a mobile offer, to a bundled offer or to several services separately.The main result is that “mobile-only” consumers seem to have a stronger budget constraint than “multi-service” users. Moreover, the study provides evidence for an “incumbency advantage” when it comes to subscribing to a bundled offer.The thesis then turns to competition between firms. More specifically, the third and last chapter offers an analysis of the impact on the equilibrium in a network industry induced by the interaction of sector regulation (notably, price regulation) and competition law (notably, the prohibition of the so-called “margin squeeze”). The debate on this subject has induced two widely opposed points of view, in particular between the US and Europe: whereas the US considers both tools to be substitutes, they are used as complements in Europe. The underlying question is thus evident: which doctrine has the least impact on the market efficiency?A theoretical analysis allows first to show that the retail price set by a vertically integrated firm, that owns the physical network and grants its downstream competitor access to it against the payment of an “access charge”, may not comply with competition law without any anticompetitive intention. Moreover, applying competition law in combination with sector regulation (notably, regulation the level of the access charge) leads to market inefficiency, characterized by an increase of retail prices, which is detrimental to consumer surplus and social welfare.The thesis concludes by reminding the importance of a deep understanding of the functioning of the telecommunications sector. Since the evolutions in this sector are not harmless, many theoretical and empirical analyses are need, so that every one can profit from the contribution of this sector."
"This thesis aims at contributing empirically to the research field of information security economics, by referring to traditional tools and knowledge in economics especially in Industrial Organization. It focuses on new and evolving elements in the cybersecurity environment such as the use of free software revenue models in digital markets (Chapter 1), the introduction of crowdsourcing mechanisms to improve software security (Chapter 2), or the increasing involvement of third parties in software security (Chapter 3). I am particularly interested in understanding the incentives of major actors that contribute to software security, such as software vendors, white-hat hackers, security firms, and other third parties. The thesis is organized in three chapters, each addressing a separate research question. In a first chapter, I examine the impact of competition intensity on software vendors' security investment behavior. I study the case of a software at the center of Internet security, namely the web browser, in which the vendors derive their revenue from advertising and compete in quality. I find out that market concentration is not necessarily harmful to security provision: indeed, higher market concentration positively impacts vendors' responsiveness in patching vulnerabilities, although this effect is reduced when a vendor is too dominant. In a second chapter, I focus on the crowdsourcing mechanism of white-hat hackers, which is representative of the market for software vulnerabilities that capitalizes on third parties' contribution. I study how hackers' perception of the uncertainty to be rewarded, determined by the level of information a contest provides about the contractual terms, affects their participation and thus the efficiency of the contest. I show that the self-selection process of participants leads to a trade-off between more numerous, but less performant participants, and higher quality but fewer participants. In a third chapter, I examine how the disclosure of a critical vulnerability affects the contribution of software vendors and third parties in discovering new vulnerabilities. I find that third parties' overall contribution in improving software security is considerable and that their contribution is significantly affected by externalities such as the disclosure of a critical vulnerability."
"Innovation and public policies can help trigger and monitor sustainability transitions. This implies transformation processes that go beyond mere technological innovation. Such transition dynamics are still to be thoroughly analyzed. We chose to study two innovation cases within the recycling industry. We use the Multilevel Perspective (Geels, 2002, 2011) to shed light upon ongoing processes and dynamics. This literature makes links between three analytical levels: landscape, sociotechnical regime, and sociotechnical niche. The sociotechnical niche is a locus for emerging transformations and a space to shelter innovation development. Concrete projects can appear and strengthen while protected from regime selection. We focus on niche diffusion processes and regime transformation triggered by the niche. We discuss some notions upon empirical analysis and propose to draw a distinction between transition intermediaries and their contributions to the niche-regime link."
"This thesis is made of two related parts. In the first one, we study the empirical behaviour of high-frequency traders on European financial markets. We use the obtained results to build in the second part new agent-based models for market dynamics. The main purpose of these models is to provide innovative tools for regulators and exchanges allowing them to design suitable rules at the microstructure level and to assess the impact of the various participants on market quality.In the first part, we conduct two empirical studies on unique data sets provided by the French regulator. It covers the trades and orders of the CAC 40 securities, with microseconds accuracy and labelled by the market participants identities. We begin by investigating the behaviour of high-frequency traders compared to the rest of the market, notably during periods of stress, in terms of liquidity provision and trading activity. We work both at the day-to-day scale and at the intra-day level. We then deepen our analysis by focusing on liquidity consuming orders. We give some evidence concerning their impact on the price formation process and their information content according to the different order flow categories: high-frequency traders, agency participants and proprietary participants.In the second part, we propose three different agent-based models. Using a Glosten-Milgrom type approach, the first model enables us to deduce the whole limit order book (bid-ask spread and volume available at each price) from the interactions between three kinds of agents: an informed trader, a noise trader and several market makers. It also allows us to build a spread forecasting methodology in case of a tick size change and to quantify the queue priority value. To work at the individual agent level, we propose a second approach where market participants specific dynamics are modelled by non-linear and state dependent Hawkes type processes. In this setting, we are able to compute several relevant microstructural indicators in terms of the individual flows. It is notably possible to rank market makers according to their own contribution to volatility. Finally, we introduce a model where market makers optimise their best bid and ask according to the profit they can generate from them and the inventory risk they face. We then establish theoretically and empirically a new important relationship between inventory and volatility."
"The purpose of senior tourism eonomics is to analyze international tourism in the context of tourism demand from the elderly. For this purpose, it is necessary to define what a senior tourist is: it is a person over 60 years old who leaves his main place of residence and travels to another country, according to the definition of the World Tourism Organization. The theoretical framework of senior tourism economics and international economics is the theory of international specialization. This thesis shows that the theories of international specialization can explain senior tourism. This is particularly the case with the theory of demand, the theory of comparative costs and the theory of technological factor endowments. In order to support this theoretical demonstration, it was decided in this thesis to compare senior tourism in France and in China. This international comparison makes it possible to show that senior tourism must be segmented on the one hand by ages and on the other hand by motivations. Thus, this comparative analysis makes it possible to complete the theoretical analysis by showing that the consideration of this segmentation can lead to the development of determining factors for senior tourism, that can be useful in the context of bilateral and multilateral international comparisons."
"This PhD dissertation focuses on water scarcity. Contrary to a-historical and technical analyses centred on physical water shortage, we develop a social-contingent approach in which water use is fundamental. Observing is the first step. It is based on an empirical analysis of the evolution of the water use mode in Almeria (Andalusia) and in Marrakech and Agadir (Morocco) between the end of the 19th century and today, thanks to fieldwork coupled with a historiographical analysis. The water use mode (ARRUS) —as our observation domain— typifies the articulation of two components: an “economic” component, related to the reciprocal adjustment of supply and final uses of produced water (formalised by technical norms: “procedure-norms”) and an “institutional” component, related to social norms (“rule-norms”) which frame the rights to own, appropriate and use water resources. This step enables us to state four chronological stylised facts that define four stages of the living cycle of a particular water use mode. The next two steps are theoretical and deal with the analytical results obtained in the first step. They require a new theoretical grid designed by BILLAUDOT. This grid proposes to link historical institutionalism, i.e. Regulation theory and COMMONS, and the sociological institutionalism of the interpretative approach of the Economics of conventions (BOLTANSKI & THÉVENOT). This double critical appropriation aims at articulating the genesis and function of institutions and, more particularly, it enables us to link each of COMMONS’ transactions with a reference value and a superior common good targeted. Thus the second step aims at characterising the particular water use mode stamped “hydraulicist” which experienced a regime phase in Spain and in Morocco during the second half of the 20th century. It features a representation of water primarily as an allocation resource. Abundance, obtained via highly-intensive civil engineering infrastructures, is one of the “modern” State’s prerogatives, which also regulates the downstream use of water. The identification of this particular water use mode’s main characteristics leads to the third step, i.e. the understanding of the crisis determinants. On the one hand this crisis involves the termination of previous regularities concerning the reciprocal adjustment of supply and the final uses of produced water: a shortage of primary water resources appears. On the other hand the institutional framework that supports the economic component is questioned. Thus norms are partially disqualified by a double process of relocation in favour of water management decentralization. From a theoretical standpoint, this implies the withdrawal of the “collective-nation” value, in favour of the “freedom-competition” value associated with “bargaining”. In addition the unsustainability of the previous water use mode has led to the emergence of environmentalist claims, which demand the implementation of new water use norms. The ecological socialisation register, for which water is understood as a living environment, is then strengthened. Finally after having shown how water scarcity, understood as the failure of the “hydraulicist” water use mode, results from a complex process, we conclude by identifying a new water use mode. We show how it tries to address the limitations of the previous mode. Nevertheless, it actually does not imply a paradigm shift but corresponds to a “crisis regime”."
"Facing economic, political and environmental stakes, electricity providers are nowadays developing incentive tools, in order to reduce consumer’s demand, particularly during peak demand periods. For residential customers, these tools can be tariffs (dynamic pricing of time-of-use tariffs), or informative devices or services (feedbacks on historical or real-time consumption, given on various media). They might go along with automatization systems that can help cutting of some electric devices when needed. In order to evaluate the capacity of these settings among their customers, electricity utilities are developing quite a few studies, which are mainly field experiment often called pilots. During these pilots, demand response tools are implemented on a population sample. These long and expensive studies lid to quantitative and qualitative analysis. We have compiled about 40 of them and extract from this survey some generalizable teachings. We have shown what these results were and highlighted pilot programs’ methodological limits. In order to propose a substitute to these heavy experimentations, we assessed the capacity or experimental economics. This relatively new discipline’s objective is to evaluation the efficiency of institutions, like markets, but also to study what animate economic agents’ behaviour, e.g. preferences, beliefs, cognitive biases, willingness to pay… We were also able to elaborate an experimental protocol dedicated to the evaluation of some demand response contracts’ acceptability. The results collected during 14 experimental sessions gave us some innovative clues and insight on these contracts acceptability. But, beyond these results, we have demonstrated that even if experimental economics can’t obviously be a substitute for field experiments, it can represent an interesting exploratory methodology. To sum up the experimental economics can take part of residential customers’ behaviour understanding, performing upstream or in complement of pilot programs."
"This thesis aims to see local population involvement in tourism projects that take place on their territory. By using the theoretical frame of the sociology of organizations, in particular that of Friedberg (1997) and the diagnostic tool territorial (Moine, 2007), an analysis of tourism activity on the river Tsiribihina was led. From the identification of common problems that every player must solve, our results highlight that the solutions adopted lead to locals orders formation. Through these results, we can understand: how tourism activities are organized on the river Tsiribihina, the role of local actors in the system, and the socio- economic impacts of this activity particularly in local level."
"The objective of this thesis is to underline the contribution of Diasporas to the development of origin countries and to their integration into the world economy. The central hypothesis points out that all Diasporas can play a valuable role in the development process of source countries through the wide range of resources they send to homelands. The thesis investigates: the clarification of the concept of Diaspora (Sheffer, 1986 ; Safran, 1991 ; Cohen, 1997 ; Ma Mung, 1992), the infrastructure of diasporic communities (Massey et al.,1993 ; Prévélakis, 2005 ; Bruneau, 2004), the mechanisms of positive effects induced by Diaspora on origin society (Saxenian, 1999), the types of resources created by expatriates and their impact on the country of origin (Meyer, 2002 ; Kapur and McHale, 2005 ; Orozco, 2005 ; Kuznetsov, 2006), as well as the determinants of the impacts of Diasporas on their home countries. In the current economic literature, the studies on Diasporas are rare and the analysis of their effects on countries of origin is limited to the role of financial resources (remittances). This work goes much beyond by participating in the elaboration of a general theory which focuses on the importance of non financial resources generated by a Diaspora. The expatriates settled abroad are not merely purveyors of financial resources for countries of origin producing only positive effects in a short term perspective but they generate other resources which are likely to produce more profound and durable positive effects. In this thesis we identify five non financial resources created by a Diaspora: cognitive, relational, institutional, organizational and symbolic resources. The use of the concept of intentionality helps emphasizing the complex effects of resources transfers from migrants showing their intentional and non-intentional sides. The research problem of this dissertation is organized around three main issues. The first one is related to the need of a Diaspora general conceptualization in the era of globalization as resource of economic convergence between sending and receiving countries, and as resource of integration into the world economy. The second direction of our argumentation is guided by the Diasporas' place in the context of knowledge economy as generator of non financial resources which can be mobilized in favour of countries of origin. Finally, the last element of the research problem is the empirical verification of the Diaspora's role in the development of the homeland, namely through the effects of non financial resources (NFR). This objective determined the selection of three emerging post-Communist Diasporas: Romanian, Moldovan and Kyrgyz Diaspora as a very interesting ground of investigation of these effects. Our choice is explained by the composition of these diasporic groups characterized by a strong presence of skilled migrants with a high level of education. Despite their recent creation, these Diasporas defined by an important “diasporic activism” which spurs the production of NFR positive effects helped answering the questions that arose during this work. These questions covered three domains: Diasporas existence and their nature, Diaspora and economic development of country of origin and the determinants of the non financial resources impact on the source country."
"The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the problematic of the viability of the European monetary union. This work is divided in three parts. In the first one, we analyse our object of research in order to precise several research axes to study in priority. We show that the European monetary union in mainly focused on the monetary stability without any formal adjustments mechanisms. The second part is focused on the question of the European members' economies synchronisation. We show that large heterogeneities remain. Two essays on the monetary policy pass-through compose the third part. We demonstrate that the interest rate pass-through was affected by the subprimes crisis and that the ECB's influence over the European stock markets is weak. This thesis insists on the fact that the European monetary and economic process of integration is incomplete and should be reinforced."
"This study aims at answering the following question: does the rise of food security issues have an impact on Localized Agrifood Systems (Syals)? More precisely, will the Syals succeed in replacing the logic of ""producing little but better"" by ""producing enough and better"" without losing their identity in productivist agricultural models? Two analyses have been conducted to find an answer to these questions. The first one focused on the determinants of food security and on the theoretical foundations of Syals as potential response to this challenge. The second one is devoted to the evolution of Syals given the needs for increases of food supply, more particularly in the case of the Olive System in the Saïs-Meknes Area in Morocco (SOM). These analyses led to the identification of ""median solutions"" which combine the logics of ""producing enough"" and of ""producing better"": ecologically intensive agriculture connected with the maintenance and the modernization of the traditional maâsras and the semi-modern crushing units. Such solutions would enable to improve food supply and, in the same time, to provide quality products while remaining linked to a territory and to the societal values including environmental dimension"
"During the last decade, many places like restaurants, shopping malls, tourism and leisure environments, have evolved into a plurality of worlds to be discovered and into which one can live sensory experiences. The multiplication of themed places led us to ponder about the supplement of value they could offer to their customers. Given the engendered costs, a strategy based on thematization has to influence behaviors of consumers. From a theoretical point of view, research on thematization draws on the experiential stream of literature, which aims at reenchanting consumers. Research in consumption sociology explains disenchantment through rationalization of production and consumption activities, which has been a landmark of the modern period. Simulation and hyperreality, as pillars of postmodernity, ground strategies of thematization. Experiential marketing then aims at giving sense and magic back to consumption experiences, be they extraordinary or not. This research studies the effects of themed place on the experience lived by consumers. It draws on works that study environmental influence on consumer behavior. A model mixing cognitive (global perceived value, satisfaction) and affective (emotions, enchantment, consumption value) variables, which aims at explaining intention to come back, is proposed. Major ski resorts are the empirical field of application. A quantitative study has been conducted in both a themed (Arc 1950) and a non-themed (Arc 1800) resort. Mean differences t-tests and structural equation modeling (PLS approach) have been used to test the proposed model. Four main contributions emerge. The first one is conceptual as we contribute to a better understanding of the enchantment. Thematization and dramatizing are also confronted. The second is related to the influence of thematization. Results show that a themed environment brings more intense emotions and improves consumer's enchantment. Perceived global value of the experience and satisfaction are also higher in the themed resort. The third contribution lies into the study of structural relations between the variables in the model. First, a strong influence of enchantment on global perceived value and satisfaction is shown. It is also noticed that satisfaction better explains intention to come back than global value. Furthermore, our results indicate that consumption value has little effects on other variables. Last, the development of a measurement scale of ski resort experience consumption value is the main methodological contribution of this research."
"The concept of generativity—that is, adults' preoccupation for the well-being of the next generations—has been the subject of numerous studies in social psychology since the 1950's. In parallel, many companies are positioning their products and services as generative, a reality that has not been extensively studied from an academic perspective in marketing. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose the formal introduction of the concept of generativity in the marketing literature, as well as the development of a measurement scale entirely dedicated to consumer generativity. We also analyze the effects of a generative positioning on consumer behaviour. The results of our first study showed that product generative positioning had positive and significant effects on attitudes toward the ad and the products, as well as purchase intentions. Those effects were even more important when targeted consumers were themselves highly generative. Moreover, the construction of the consumer generativity scale revealed two dimensions for the construct: communal and agentic. The analysis of the predictive validity of the consumer generativity scale has again shown the importance of targeting highly generative people in the case of products positioned as generative. However, the analysis of the generative type of positioning, the locus of control and family income as moderators did not reveal statistically significant relationships. Our research have nevertheless shown that married consumers were more generative than singles, and only people with a confortable family income or raising children had a high index of communal generativity. In addtion, fathers were more generative than mothers with regards to the agentic dimension of generativity. These results also stress the importance of identifying the type of generativity (communal or agentic) demonstrated by said consumers."
"The aim of this dissertation is to know to what extent an economic crisis can result from a specific dimension of financialization: the search for shareholder value by firms. Financialization is the unprecedented influences of financial systems over some components of the economic activities after the liberalization of such systems since the 1970s. Among the aforesaid components we can find the management of firms. Such management is shaped so that production expenditures are lowered as much as possible while priority is given to debt for financing decisions. The objective is to create as much 'shareholder value' as possible, to wit, to create as much income as possible for shareholders. The dissertation unfolds in four steps. First, a critical survey is made. The problem is generally solved by means of models putting into equations equilibrated markets. However, the convergence to equilibrium is barely proved. This logical inconsistency is not new and affects economic theory as a whole. Thus, solving the problem can be based on a model which conceptualizes the economic activities without referring to equilibrated markets. The second step is to elaborate on such conceptualization. A possibility is to account for the economic activities on the basis of money, thus giving rise to a monetary approach of these activities. The emphasis is put on the interrelated payments made possible by the use of money, the latter being the unit for payments to be expressed and the means through which payments are made. Payments are conceptualized in relation with three components: i) the process that creates means of payment, generally bank credit; ii) the settlement of negative balances (some agents cannot fully repay their debts as they do not benefit from enough payments); and iii) the modification of payments by agents from one period to another, according to their objectives and constraints. These modifications lead the network of payments to evolve over time. The third step is to put into equations an evolving network of payments in order to solve the problem. A system of non-linear recurrence equations determine all payments from a typology elaborated beforehand, as well as the financing of them. The system also determines the settlement of the negatives balances which result from payments. The numerous recurrences give rise to evolution. The whole system abstracts from goods and the related phenomena, in accordance with the monetary approach. The fourth step is to use the model for the problem to be solved. An economic crisis can be the result of the evolution per se. Agents which periodically change their payments can lead other agents to record negative balances. Thus, the network of payments can evolve in such a way that some firms are insolvent. The subsequent bankruptcies can be large enough to decrease production and employment, as in an economic crisis. In that case, the evolution of the network of payments is defined as non-viable. To know if the search for shareholder value leads to an economic crisis thus amounts to know if the search for shareholder value leads to a non-viable evolution of the network of payments. Numerical simulations are made, notably with the configurations of parameters that are associated to a more or less search for shareholder value by firms. The model leads to the following general result: either the search for shareholder value results in an economic crisis, either it moves the economic activities closer to a crisis, either the latter occurs irrespective of the search for shareholder value. This result applies whether management is totally oriented by shareholder value or only a few. This result also applies without savings and with the indebtedness of wage-earners, contrary to the models of the survey; however they fail due to the difficulties to prove the formation of their equilibrated markets."
"The aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better understanding of the labour market in informal-dominated developing economies. Mali is its study case. In the first part, it highlights the difficulty to approach unemployment through the ambiguous status of the informal workers, swinging between employment and unemployment. We show that the informal economy exacerbates the instability of the unemployment frontiers without alienating the wage stickiness, which we apprehend through a wage curve. The second part of the thesis presents the employment measures and shows that though, on one hand, they respond accurately to the labour market needs and aim to correct its shortcomings - particularly regarding the financing and training -, on the other hand, their execution is deeply dysfunctional. That explains the mitigated results of some measures, in implementation for over two decades. In the third part, the attention is turned to the labour supply, the weak knowledge of which can partially explain the failures of the employment policies. We examine the role of the household environment in the participation decision and the job search and shows that many variables of this environment can contribute to improving the measures."
"This PhD thesis work addresses the following problem: can Cross-Sector Social Partnerships (CSSP) be a strategic lever for the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility? Going beyond the phenomenon of collaboration between the company and the nonprofit organization, this research helps legitimize the role of a little known stakeholder, civil society. This work relied upon action research methodology. In cooperation with researchers, action research aims to create knowledge for and with practitioners. The CCSPs are presented from two different perspectives as one action research was developed in Grenoble, France, and the other was made in New York City, United States. The first analysis explains the phenomenon from the perspective of the company and the second shows the view of the non-profit organization. To understand the CSSP process, the eleven societal partnerships studied are broken down into four phases: 1) initialization and definition of strategy; 2) selecting the right partner; 3) recurrent dynamics; and 4) relational interdependence. The purpose of this phenomenon is the social and/or environmental value creation; economic interest is complementary and not a priority. Exceeding their respective organizational goals, the collaborative project's stakeholders work together to find a solution to a common problem. This process of CSSP embodies corporate social responsibility. The phase of trial and error between deliberate strategy and emergent strategy tends to increase as part of a CSR strategy. Civil society acts as an interface between citizens and the business. As a member of a local area network, civil society provides access to new resources and skills. The company benefits from its association with social and environmental nonprofits organizations, while the nonprofit organization hope the company provides financial resources. However, the organizational culture of a company and an association differ. To work together, stakeholders of the project have to go beyond their own interests to exceed their respective organizational goals. However, during the collaborative process, the company tends to impose its will on the partnership. Finally, the maturity of the project is perceived by a collective sense of belonging to the same team. The purpose of the process is to provide value creation for stakeholders, but for society as a whole it may be varied."
"The thesis analyzes why Indian child labor policies have evolved to programs that aim at the eradication of child labor, however inefficiently. In order to get there, the adopted approach links segmentationnists and regulationnists theories. The first one analyses rural Indian growth as the heart of the social question. The second one studies the synchrony between policies and social question. The dynamic of child labor policies is seen as a step towards the social construction of an institutional architecture for Indian rural growth. But, given their modernism, these policies have proven unsuitable for Indian rural spaces. Hence, child labor elimination policies increase the spatial segmentation. The thesis considers this dynamic as a revelation of the Indian State modernization. Child labor policies are analyzed in the way of the construction of a capitalist economy in rural spaces. By increasing the spatial segmentation, the Indian state modernization deregulates the Indian path. This dynamic is dangerous for the Indian political system."
"Recently, ""innovation"" has become the core strategy of the enterprises; it also attracted attentions by researchers. In Management Science, The research of innovation is not only confined to technological innovations but also including organizational and managerial innovation. This thesis examines three types of innovations within a framework of a supply chain, which includes innovation project, the process of diffusion of innovation concerning the supply chain, and the ownership of the actors on the main elements in the process. The research objective of this thesis is to verify the steps of diffusion to an innovative project and analyze the absorbing level of the actors within an innovation project, with the actors including the top management level, the division level and operation level in a big industrial group. A conceptual model has been established on the basis of literature review on the theories of innovation, supply chain management and project management. Subsequently, an exploratory qualitative study is conducted in Schneider Electric. The data was collected through three approaches: individual interviews, field survey and internal documentations. Then, the quantitative content analysis including the coding technique is used to deal with the data obtained. The results provide that the supply chain management innovations is not only including organizational innovation and managerial innovation, but may also contribute to technological innovation. The diffusion of an innovative project involves five steps: i) Identification of problems, ii) Matching problems / innovative project, iii) Launching of the project, iv) Execution of the project, and v) Closing of the project. The analysis also shows different absorbing level from the actors on the mains elements of this process. In this thesis, the model of diffusion of innovation project has been validated; the contributions and perspectives have been thus proposed."
"This dissertation provides an evaluation of the environmental content of economic relations between Japan and China, analysing three channels of climate-friendly technology transfers To identify the dynamics of green technology transfers (improvement of energy efficiency, pollutant recovery, cleaning up, exploitation of renewable energy sources), the demonstration is concentrated on three vectors: trade flows, international patent families and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects of the Kyoto Protocol. The analysis of trade flows from Japan to China shows that Chinese imports of environmental goods, capital goods and high technology goods are channels of technological diffusion. In particular, the econometric estimations reveal that imports of high technology goods affect negatively the energy and carbon intensity of the Chinese GDP. The analysis of international patent family data enable to identify that technologies aiming at reducing air pollution are dominant in transfers from Japan to China. Finally, transfers of knowledge and capital goods appear in the implementation of CDM projects financed by Japanese firms and implanted in China. The empirical analysis reveals that training plans are implemented in parallel to the transmissions of environmental equipments, knowing that transfers occur mainly through wind and water projects. This dissertation reveals that the density of economic relations between Japan and China is accompanied by the diffusion of green technologies. The development gap between Japan and China as well as the presence of absorptive capacity in China fosters technology diffusion through economic flows. The positive impact of these flows in terms of environmental quality is strengthened by the Chinese Government dedicated to technology transfers and the legislation concerning foreign investment."
"Nowadays, the brands undoubtly represent an important element of the consumer society. The number of brands does not stop increasing, thus creating a confusion in the spirit of the consumers, and resulting in many difficulties and challenges for the businesses. Each year, companies spend a large amount of money on managing their brand so that their brand are known and present in the spirit of the consumers. This drives us to be very concerned by the problems linked to the construction and to the conservation of a strong brand equity for a firm. The brand equity is strongly influenced by symbolic or intangible benefits. The brand is no longer an inanimate object. The marketing activities confer to the brand a personality, a soul. Thanks to that, the brand becomes a partner in its relation with the consumers. This thesis focuses on studying the effect of the brand personality and the congruence on the personality between brand and consumer on the brand equity. It studies the values concerning the construction and the maintenance of a good relation with the consumers that a strong brand equity can bring to the firm. All of experimental studies were implemented in Vietnam. The results bring theoretical contributions for a better understanding of the nature of the mutual relation between the brand equity and the interpersonal relationship between brand and consumer. They furnish methodological contributions by creating a measurement scale both for brand personality and brand equity in the Vietnamese context. They also provide important managerial implications for the companies that want to market their products on the Vietnamese market."
"The aim of this dissertation is to know whether the decentralized approach, officially put forward in the management of sovereign debt crises since their origin, is not only feasible but also efficient in terms of equity of the debt burden sharing. We define indeed an efficient restructuring process as a procedure of short duration (less than one year) and that meets the needs of both parties. If, in the side of creditors, the discount should not be abusive, towards the debtor, the debt must become sustainable, in both economic and social terms. Field analysis process of renegotiating debt focuses exclusively on Latin American economies, insofar as they represent debtors who historically recorded the highest number of defaults. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we finally defend the thesis that the failure of the various restructuring process is directly subordinate to the iniquity of sharing the debt burden, which is due to an imbalance of bargaining power, as an inherent part of decentralized management. Our macroeconomic and inductive approaches built the framework for socio-economic analysis, which uses history, political economy, but also a study based on social psychology. This dissertation is structured in two parts, themselves divided into two chapters. The first part focuses on understanding the origins of crises, their prevention and crisis management, and then their failures. It combines empirical observation and theoretical underpinnings of the decentralization. Specifically, the first chapter outlines, given the dual responsibility in the onset and sinking into the crisis, the failure of the decentralized approach in the long term. It concludes that not only decentralization is inapplicable, since a third party is always forced to intervene, but nor it does allow an fair sharing of the crisis costs. The second chapter consecutively seeks to understand why such a restructuring process is still maintained. The political economy of decentralization then shows that the choice between regulation and ""laissez-faire"" is not so much linked to economic efficiency criteria, but rather to ideological and political considerations. The second part of this work symmetrically proposes lines of thought to overcome the main obstacles identified in most cases of defaults and restructurings. Thus, if the third chapter addresses the second, fourth echoes the first. Indeed, the third chapter shows that decentralization can't be efficient, not only because of its technical pitfalls, but also because of the nature of the both contractual parties. Sovereign immunity having been put into perspective in the first two chapters, the point here is to analyze the functioning of financial markets in an alternative way, compared with the efficiency hypothesis. That is why we go into the Keynes psychosocial analysis (1936) in depth with the behavioral finance. Such a study reveals the inability of creditors to organize themselves in good faith, while it is the sine qua non condition of the decentralized approach implementation and efficiency. Therefore, the final chapter concludes on the need for a shift towards a more centralized approach, which includes a neutral, competent and institutionalized third party. Here, if multilateralism must prevail as a model of collaborative thinking, in regard to the management of the current debt crisis in Europe, such a possibility remains unlikely in the short term. This is why debtor countries may have to take some unilateral decisions, including potentially legitimate and transparent debt repudiation in case of sinking into the crisis, in order to compel the international community to make that needed shift. Keywords: Sovereign debt, Restructuration, Decentralized approach, Dependency theories, Political Economy, Behavioral Finance."
"The number of students entering higher education is growing year by year and it increases the number of graduates of higher education system. However, the pace of integration of these graduates is so shy. So the unemployment rate of graduates is growing year by year. According to national surveys, in 2004, the unemployment rate for graduates was about 19% and exceeds the national level that was 9%. In 2010, the rate rose to 25%. Thus, in the absence of attention to this target group its insertion becomes increasingly worrying. Therefore, we asked ourselves this question: what strategies should be put in place to promote the integration of graduates? We analyze the conventional circuits insertion such as the public and the private sector in Mali. According to statistics, these two circuits are rigidities in the hiring of thousands of graduates of higher education. Thus, we turned to entrepreneurship by saying it could be a vehicle for creating jobs for them and that would be supported by aid policy for entrepreneurship enrolled in a program called ""Youth Employment Program"". For this, we selected two assumptions: (1): Entrepreneurship is a factor in creating employment opportunities for graduates of higher education, (2): aid policy entrepreneurship can encourage this process. After a descriptive analysis of the functioning of the labor market in Mali and after studying several theories and research work related to human capital and the role of skills in the field of entrepreneurship or economic development, we managed the following results based on our assumptions: 1- Yes, entrepreneurship is a factor in creating employment for graduates. 2 - No, policy support for entrepreneurship does not promote this process."
"The territorial dimension has become a major issue in the last twenty years both at level of enterprises and institutions. For the first, territorial concerns lie mainly in the choice of locations of activities and forms of business cooperation. For the second, the recurring issue is that of regional planning that lean to the territorial governance. Thus, starting from the inherent idéology in this thesis, our main objective was to determine and assess the governance factors highlighting the role of territory and proximity to industrial development in Douala. The development of our ideas was structured in a lecture divided into two parts, each comprising two chapters. Before discussing the analytical framework for space management and industrial proliferation in Douala (part two), we reviewed the theoretical and empirical framework of industrial location and territorial dynamics (first part). The objective of the first part was to trace the outline of the evolution of the location of industrial activities such as they are set by certain works like those of A.MARSHALL (1890), P.KRUGMAN (1991), and territorial theories on the one hand, and to specify the theoretical analysis of the setting regulation on the other hand. The regulation approach (part two) challenges the rules of mutual coordination between government interventions and strategies of private actors in the process of industrial location and local development in Douala. This is usually made following the effective interaction and coordination conveyed between the local and territorial actors. The combination of coordination within the public sphere with coordination within the private sphere in a broader partnership probably constitutes the most effective mode of operation of territorial governance which is most indicated to address transversal problems across the city and CEMAC area."
"During the financial and economic crisis of 2008, it was noticed that the amount of capital required for banks' trading portfolio was significantly less than the real losses. To understand the causes of this low capital requirement, it seemed important to estimate the reliability of the market risk models and to propose stress testing methodologies for the management of extreme risks. The objective is to measure the capital requirement on a trading portfolio, composed of shares and commodities by the measure of the Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall. To achieve this goal, we use the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) and two internal models commonly used by banks: historical simulation method and model of the normal law. A first evaluation of the reliability made on the three risk models under the hypothesis of constant volatility, shows that the internal banks' models and the GPD model do not measure correctly the risk of the portfolio during the crisis periods. However, GPD model is reliable in periods of low volatility but with a strong overestimation of the real risk; it can lead banks to block more capital requirement than necessary. A second evaluation of the reliability of the risk models was made under the hypothesis of the change of the volatility and by considering the asymmetric effect of the financial returns. GPD model is the most reliable of all, irrespective of market conditions. The performance of the internal banks' risk models improves when considering the change of the volatility. The integration of the historic and hypothetical scenarios in the risk models, improves the estimation of the extreme risk, while decreasing the subjectivity blamed to the stress testing techniques. The stress testing realized with the internal models of banks does not allow a correct measure of the extreme risk. GPD model is better adapted for the stress testing techniques. We developed an algorithm of stress testing which allow banks to estimate the extreme risk of their portfolios and to identify the risk factors causing this risk. The calculation of the capital requirement based on the sum of the VaR and the stress VaR is not logical and leads to doubling the capital requirement of banks. Consequently, it conducts to a credit crunch in the economy. We observe that the multiplier coefficient and the principle of square root of time of the Basel's agreement lead banks to make arbitration in favor of risk models that are not reliable."
"Among all Latin american countries, Colombia and Venezuela are the closest, for reasons as much historical as geographical and cultural. However, profound constitutional reforms in the two countries, completed during the 1990s, conflict on many levels. The health care system, a critical stake in both reforms, exemplifies this divergence: inspired by the reform of the American health care system, the Colombian reform reserves a central place for private insurers, whereas the Venezuelan reform claims to be the anchor of « 21st century socialism » and the re-engagement of the State in the health care system. Though very different, each model has allowed for measurable improvement in health indicators, without being able to resolve the deep contradictions to which they are subjected."
"This action research is focused on the concept of sustainable development applied to tourism. It starts with an analysis of fundamental texts in order to know the essence of sustainability. It goes on analysing the taking into account of this concept by the tourism-concerned stakeholders. It ends with operational recommendations in order to facilitate the appropriation and application of this concept, relying on various experiments taken within territories, businesses and training courses. This research sounded useful, for we are aware of the worsening of environmental and social problems on the planet and of the part of responsibility taken by the tourism activity. It seemed useful, since we have observed, over 15 years experience that stakeholders work to develop new forms of tourism, less predatory for environment and socially more performing. Unluckily, those initiatives often remain fragile, marginal and marginalised. The reasons are varied. The most fundamental one for us is a lack of know-how in making them stronger, more numerous, more significant. This know-how implies a change in culture and practices, and the application of values linked to universalism, at the service of stimulation and autonomy, in a generalized logic of cooperation. Economy is not left aside in this research. Today, tourism in France is losing in competitiveness, basing itself on standards and norms, therefore generating a frenetic concurrence between destinations and businesses. It is time to change the development model in order to favour a diffuse, diversified, creative and inspired offer relying on values and territorial resources, able to respond to both tourists and citizens expectations.STAR"
"The globalization, the adaptation to the consumer needs, the creation of new products represent permanent challenges to promote the market demand and make the innovation a strategic axis to approach. These requirements have enhanced an increasing necessity to rethink about the process of innovation and more particularly the management of the innovative projects through the implementation of innovation platforms. Team work is dedicated to the innovation where the involved members have transverse knowledge and are capable of sharing them to innovate.This doctoral approach tries to examine and to identify the role of the sharing knowledge between the members of innovation platforms in the elaboration of aninnovation process. It deals withthe following problematic: howthe sharing knowledgewithin the innovation platforms favour the emergence of innovations ? By examining the phenomenon of the knowledge sharing taking into consideration an articulation between innovation management and knowledge management,this research digs deep into the Knowledge-based View of the firm, where the cognitive and social practices play an important role for the innovation. Through a qualitative research, three case studies were led within three innovation platforms of a leader group for food industry sector in Tunisia. We were able to identify the organizational devices which influence the interactions between the members involved within the innovation platforms. The deep examination of the practices of each innovation platform allowed us to observe the following phenomena: although the implementation of the innovation platformsis linked to the managerial strategy based on innovation and makes a reference toa basic model, the practices of every platform of innovation is specific. Beyond the transverse quality of their structure, the innovation platforms appear as a relatively flexible formula that every enterprise of the groupcan appropriate and adapt it to its context and its constraints. In the three case studies, the knowledge sharing appears as an organizational and technological approach aiming at sharing and integrating the knowledge between the members of an innovation platform to innovate. The interest of this approach is not based on the knowledge in itself but on ""Who"" detains it and ""How"" it is shared within the innovation platform. Finally, two elements allowed to a better understandingof the knowledge sharing: the strategic management and the corporate culture. Our study on the innovation platforms shows that when there is a deliberate action to establish an initiativeof innovation based on the knowledge sharing, this action becomes crucialto the life of the organization as far as it can question its balance of power, arouses the enthusiasm of certain actors and the distrust of others. This thesis, with its three case studiesof innovation platforms, does not only ponder on the cultural level concerning the practices of knowledge sharing but also tacklesthe identity level. The praxis is the following one: the knowledge sharing between the members of the innovation platforms enhances the emergence of the innovations within the companies under study. In terms of the managerial contribution, we consider that the knowledge sharing within the innovation platforms represents anevolving strategic action for the innovation initiatives."
"Automotive industry has a special place in the history of the capitalism, of which it determines up to the name of its last great period: “Fordism”. It has to face double environmental constraints since the end of the 20th century: predicted exhaustion of world fossil fuel resources and the control of pollution, particularly atmospheric. Road transport accounts for 20% of the emission of greenhouse gases. The purpose of this work is to analyse how this industry will react to internalize that double constraint by focusing on “innovation”. The theoretical framework proposed by Schumpeter and prolonged by the evolutionary authors is mobilized to test the following assumption: automotive industry is starting a new path of dependence to become emancipated from this double constraint. Consequently, the transition to the hybrid engine, as an “breakthrough eco-innovation”, points out the end of the “lock in” on the previous path characterized by the dependence upon the internal combustion engine."
"While the bank sector will be the center of huge changes, during next years, due to a restructuration of its model. It seems relevant to understand whether the sensory marketing can create added value for the customer and companies in this context A scent and/or a music diffusion must nevertheless be the object of recommandations. Indeed, will a scent or/a music with high level of congruency with brand image have differents effects(and stronger or lower) than a scent (or a music) with a low level of congruency on the satisfaction and behavioral responses of consumer ? This doctoral research aims to investigate this issue. Two diffents stages have been realised. First of all, a qualitative study allowed to show brand's identity markers allowing the creation of two types of scents (high congruency vs.low congruency) and two types of musics (high congruency vs. low congruency). The second stage, quantitative, has been realised in situ. Results showed that diffusion of a perfume with low congruency with the brand image leads to more favorable responses of physical elements and in fine on the satisfaction and on the behavioral responses. Conversely,a music's diffusion overall leads to negatives effects"
"With knowledge at the heart of the creation and maintenance of competitive advantage through innovation, an organization’s ability to absorb external knowledge is critical. This research supports the idea that the initiation and perpetuation of a knowledge absorption process are not only the result of internal organizational efforts. It aims to improve understanding of how Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS) can enhance their clients’ absorption process. Based on the dynamic capabilities approach, this research highlights the need to take into account: (1) the conditions that will enable the initiation and perpetuation of a knowledge absorption process; (2) the role of external organizations into absorption process. This Multi-Monograph Thesis is composed of one theoretical article and three empirical articles utilizing qualitative multiple-case study methodology in the field of innovative design consulting. This thesis leads to three major contributions: (1) the notion of the “insemination capacity” of KIBS, which is the ability to adopt, select, contextualize and preserve knowledge so as to initiate and perpetuate a knowledge absorption process; (2) the connections between absorptive and insemination capacities; (3) the guidance provided to a client’s co-production activities in the context of innovative design. Ultimately, this research contributes to Management Sciences and Strategic Management literature on absorptive capacity and innovation. It also provides recommendations to managers on how to develop absorptive capacity through the service and consulting relationship."
"This dissertation is made of three distinct chapters. In the first chapter, we introduce a new measure of herding that allows for tracking dynamics of individual herding. Using a database of nearly 8 million trades executed between 1999 and 2006 by 87,373 individual investors, we show that individual herding is persistent over time and that past performance and the level of sophistication influence this behavior. We are also able to answer a question that was previously unaddressed in the literature: is herding profitable for investors? Our unique dataset reveals that the investors trading against the crowd tend to exhibit more extreme returns and poorer risk-adjusted performance than the herders. In the second chapter, we show that measuring the accuracy of a target price is not sufficient to assess its quality, because the forecast predictability (which depends on the stock return volatility and on the forecast horizon) is likely to vary across stocks and over time. We argue that the evidence of time persistent differences in analysts' target price accuracy, obtained in previous studies, cannot be interpreted as a proof of persistent differential abilities. Our analysis indicates that the persistence in accuracy is driven by persistence in stock return volatility. We introduce a measure of target price quality that considers both the forecast inaccuracy and the forecast predictability. Using elements from option-pricing theory, we provide a simple solution to the issue of estimating target price predictability. Our empirical analysis reveals that, when forecast predictability is taken into account, financial analysts do not exhibit significant persistent differential abilities to forecast future stock prices. In the third chapter, we show that experienced financial analysts tend to cover different firms than inexperienced analysts. Experienced analysts tend to follow blue chips (i.e., large, international, mature firms) while inexperienced analysts focus on small, young, growth-oriented firms. These differences in coverage decisions imply that inexperienced analysts issue target prices on firms for which stock returns are more volatile, and thus less predictable. As a consequence, the accuracy measure of target prices fails to evaluate differences in ability between experienced and inexperienced analysts. When taking into account these differences in coverage decisions, we still find that experienced analysts do a better job at forecasting stock prices. Our results on the influence of analysts' characteristics on target price quality are statistically significant but economically weak."
"Start-ups' represent a large pool of job and wealth creation. The high heterogeneity of their trajectories raises questions about the factors behind the growth process. Most previous research on this issue highlights the central role of the entrepreneur, primarily in terms of ability to lose control within the company and motivation for growth. This research is embedded in the broader conception of corporate governance that calls for taking into account simultaneously disciplinary and cognitive views of governance. This study analyzes the 2,703 entrepreneurs' profiles of start-ups which have been supported by the French Ministry in charge of Research between 1999 and 2012. The main objective is to understand the relationship between entrepreneurs' representations in terms of growth and governance and the trajectories of their firms. The results show the existence of four types of entrepreneurs. The independent entrepreneurs have a cognitive approach to corporate governance and consider that shareholders should have an enabling power by bringing skills, knowledge and network to the firm. They expect that growth could offer them greater independence, and are at the head of a company having experienced some growth in the past; they are still more motivated to continue to grow. The collective entrepreneurs have a hybrid approach to governance, centered primarily on managerial disciplinary role of shareholders but also on their cognitive contributions. These entrepreneurs only see growth in a positive way and, unlike independent entrepreneurs, if their company has not yet experienced growth, they are highly motivated for growth. The entrepreneurs-managers have only a disciplinary financial governance view; they anticipate growth as a way to consolidate the company that has seen its size greatly increased in the past. Their motivation to growth is also very high. Finally, self-centered entrepreneurs accord only extremely small role to shareholders; they have a negative view of growth, are at the head of a company which has no past growth and do not want to change in the future. To conclude, we observe a strong relationship between entrepreneurs' representations in terms of governance and growth, and the trajectories of the start-ups they lead."
"A company's success is guaranteed by its relational approach, that is, its ability to establish, develop and maintain new business relationships that are mutually beneficial over time. The seller becomes the centrepiece of the firm, since almost all of his time is spent in contact with customers. This relational approach in a sales context is actually at the heart of successful business. Nevertheless, some businesses have been disappointed with the results of their investment in the relational approach. These mixed results indicate the importance of further study into the relational approach in a sales context, and in particular the need to identify the factors that influence the performance of the seller. The object of our study is to define and understand what are the individual characteristics of the seller that influence the attitudes and behaviours of the client. The mechanism of the relational approach in a sales context is reproduced using a model and the formulation of hypotheses tested on a sample of 175 sellers and customers (the dyad). Our study focuses on the positive influences of self-efficacy, attitude towards selling and expertise on the relationship quality, the purchase intentions and the word-of-mouth of the customer. The relationship quality mediates the effect of expertise on the purchase intention and the word-of-mouth and intuition moderates the relationship between self-efficacy, attitude towards selling and expertise on the purchase intentions and the word-of-mouth. The results confirm the direct effect of the antecedents and the mediating role of the relationship quality. The moderating role of intuition on the relationship between the antecedents and the purchase intentions was also confirmed. Our contributions add to the theoretical body of research on the relational approach and the methodological dyadic approach to sales research. For managers, our research has numerous applications for increasing the effectiveness of hiring and training sales forces."
"The thesis is in the field of complex systems, applied to an economic system. In this thesis, an agent-based model has been proposed to model the production cycle. It comprises firms, workers, and a bank, and respects stock-flow consistency. Its central assumption is that firms plan their production based on an expected profit margin. A simple scenario of the model, where the expected profit margin is the same for all firms, has been analyzed in the context of simple stochastic growth models. Results are a firms' size distribution close to a power law, and tent-shaped growth rate distribution, and a growth rate variance scaling with firm size. These results are close to empirically found stylized facts. In a more comprehensive version, the model contains additional features: heterogeneous profits margins, as well as interest payments and the possibility of bankruptcy. This relates the model to agent-based macroeconomic models. The extensions are described theoretically theoretically with replicator dynamics. New results are the age distribution of active firms, their profit rate distribution, debt distribution, bankruptcy statistics, as well as typical life cycles of firms, which are all qualitatively in agreement with studies of firms databases of various countries.The proposed model yields promising results by respecting the principle that jointly found results may be generated by the same process, or by several ones which are compatible."
"A large number of studies on counterfeiting explore consumers behavior in the consumption of counterfeit articles. But few of them consider luxury brand consumers and counterfeiting. Our doctoral study attempts to contribute to this field by studying principal aspects of luxury brand buying behavior. Our research aims to identify and measure insensitivity to counterfeiting which is a new concept developed in this study. Brand experience and relationship brand variables will also be considered. Our study contributes to counterfeiting's researches, and more precisely to researches on consumption of legitimate products. On the other side, the connection with brand experience or the relationships with the luxury brand have not been undertaken in counterfeiting researches which leads us to considerate these two important aspects of the luxury brand. Concerning the methodological facet, we first propose the measure of consumer's reaction toward counterfeiting, namely insensitivity to counterfeiting. Then, we perform a PLS model that includes all concepts studied and specifies complex links between concepts. In a managerial way, we propose to counter counterfeiting by focusing on the luxury brand itself. We suggest for luxury brand managers to choose the appropriate marketing tool. Immersion in brand universe, consumer implication or focusing on opinion leaders, are good ways to enhance consumer's loyalty, despite the presence of counterfeiting."
"This thesis analyses the foundations and the evolution of the water economy and management in Lebanon by emphasizing the legal, institutional and political frameworks. The study uses a mixed approach combining a qualitative methodology, through surveys, interviews and documentation and a quantitative approach using econometric modeling. By composing our conceptual framework, we seek to define the political economy of the resource in Lebanon and the ties linking water use to land tenure structures. The study is composed of five chapters. Our first chapter reviews the economic literature dealing with the water value and scarcity and addresses a criticism concerning globalized paradigms, mainly, river basin management, good governance and the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). Going beyond those theories and using a historic-materialist approach, we propose our analytical framework of a ""waterscape"" combining the hydraulic societies theory developed by Karl Wittfogel and the ""moments"" approach of David Harvey. Our second chapter explores, by adopting a chronological approach over a long period, the evolution of the legal and the institutional structures of water management in Lebanon. This chapter covers four centuries of the Levant territories under the Ottoman Empire, followed by the French mandate over Lebanon and, finally, the national construction phase between the independence and country's civil war. Our analysis seeks to understand the historical foundations of the relationship between land tenure regimes and social power during those periods. We also develop in this chapter the pilars that drove the Lebanese hydraulic mission in order to present an interpretation of the dominant discourse in the water management. Our third chapter reviews the socio-spatial characteristics of the water and wastewater infrastructures during the reconstruction period. We extend our analysis to depict the institutional fragmentation characterizing the water public authorities in Lebanon. We emphasize on the water policies undertaken in the country during this recent period under structural adjustment and neoliberal paradigms, mainly, the adoption of the IWRM principles by the Lebanese government and the ground preparation to Public-Private Partnerships. The fourth chapter offers a public good model analyzing the concerns behind the allocation of water projects during the last two decades. Econometric results clearly approve our hypothesis that the distributive politics are solely driven by partisanship concerns during this period with no consideration about socio-economical and environmental features of regions. The fifth chapter develops the links of water use to the Lebanese agricultural economy in order to understand the main drivers of irrigation. We shed the light on the privileges of big landowner in accessing to subsidies following a water intensive production destined to the Gulf countries. This chapter detects the link between country's food system and water by presenting the virtual water balance and food water footprint. Finally, the chapter verifies the state of water in the liberalization process of the country by using a gravity model. From our reading of the socio-natural process of water in Lebanon, our results show that the modes of use, production and appropriation of the resource in the country are produced by a close relation between land property and power, an inherited link from the political history of Lebanon maintained by the confessional system."
"Normative influence has proved to be pervasive. However, despite the large amount of empirical results showing the extent of social norms influence on individual's responses (i.e. beliefs, attitude, behavior), a type of response, hedonic reactions, has been largely ignored by research. Thus, normative influence effect on hedonic reactions remains fundamentally unknown. Lack of results regarding such an effect raises important issues for marketing as many products' assessment depends on the pleasure their consumption provides (i.e. experiential goods). This research investigates immediate normative reference group influence for self-related motives on responses to music. Self-construal, a key moderator of normative influence is also considered. Few researches agreed on the idea that individuals with an independent self-construal (i.e. independents) are less sensitive to normative influence that individuals with an interdependent self-construal (i.e. interdependent). However, some results suggest that far from being insensitive to social norms, independents can even be, in particular settings, more influenced than interdependent. Thus, the hypothesis is made that if a group conveys a social identity which is consistent with independents' goals, then independents should identify to a greater extent with this group and be positively more influenced by the group norms than interdependent. An online experiment (n=278) and a laboratory experiment (n=190) are conducted. Results show that reference groups can exert an immediate normative influence for self-related motives on hedonic reactions to music, overall affective response (i.e. attitude), beliefs regarding the music “objective” quality and need to reexperience the music. Contrary to what was expected, self-construal do not moderate normative influence. However, results suggest that independents can identify to a greater extent to some groups than interdependents. Implications for research and marketing strategies are discussed."
"This dissertation is made of three distinct chapters. The first chapter investigates whether the effects of the previously identified factors vary along the debt maturity spectrum. Special emphasis is place on the extremely cases. Notably, we find that the effects of the conventional determinants vary substantially across the debt maturity distribution. Effect attenuation is observed at the lower and the higher debt maturity percentiles. The mechanism lies in the binding refinancing risk in the short extremes and the lessened refinancing risk in the long extremes. By contrast, the fact that a firm has access to public credit or not accentuates to a larger degree the heterogeneity in the observed effects of the included factors across the debt maturity distribution. This result can be explained by the argument that the refinancing risk is even more binding for firms without access to public credit. Altogether, our findings confirm our intuition concerning the heterogeneous effects of the conventional factors exerted along the debt maturity spectrum, especially for the extreme cases. In the second chapter, we examine debt maturity choices of firms from a dynamic perspective. Our results draw clear implications for a herding effect. Firms herd towards the levels as well as the changes of industry peers' debt maturities. Remarkably, this herding effect explains a much larger proportion of variation in debt maturity adjustment than firms' own characteristics. After eliminating the impact of changes in the yield curve, changes in peer firms' debt maturity policies drives debt maturity dynamics to a larger extent. Meanwhile, we find that debt maturity is persistent over time and that the persistence is primarily attributed to firms with short debt maturities. The third chapter analyzes the impact of market timing. We document that big firms with strong fundamentals attempt to “time” the issuance of long-term debts subsequent to temporary market mispricing. Particularly, for this type of firms, the effect of market timing dominates over that of herding during the periods firms raise large amounts of debts. For small firms with weak fundamentals, the effect of market timing is insignificant whereas the herding evidence is prominent."
"This thesis examines the transformation of China's financial system in the context of financial liberalization. Its aim is to question the possibility of establishing an alternative financing model for economic development in developing countries. This research shows that the experience of the financial transition in China can be seen as a relevant case, reflecting the range of approaches to financial repression and the pitfalls of financial liberalization policies. It seeks to analyze the paradox of the Chinese economy: an exceptional economic performance is accompanied by the fragility of the financial system. The specific objective of this work is to discern the specifics of the Chinese financial transition to contribute to a better understanding of China's current financial structure, its effectiveness in the economic development and the impact of financial openness for financial system stability."
"The aim of this study is to analyze the theoretical, experimental and empirical rationalities underlying collective actions within associative economic microsystems. In particular, in the study of fairs and free markets in Chile and of agro-ecological markets in the Federal State of Paraná, Brazil. Due to the high complexity as it rises from these economic and social phenomena, our starting point has been the systemic analysis. It is about a universe with particular experiences, in which inferences from local level -the experiences- to global level -the theory- are not obvious. Furthermore, these experiences must be understood from the systemic set, which in its turn, cannot be reduced to the mere aggregation of individuals and institutions. Thus, at a research level, it implies the use of a bifocal gaze, with which the whole universe is reconfigured as someone enters into the details of its particularities. The field works were conducted in Valparaíso and Metropolitan Regions of Chile and in regions of Paraná Federal State of Brazil. In addition, a small sample of farmers and organizations in Chile was also considered to test hypothesis on social capital, cooperative behavior and shared resources management. The evidence suggests that sustainable collective actions require of a cooperative context which, at the time, involves processes to build up “confidence relations”. On another hand, information in that world is unavailable, scarce and/or costly. In addition, collective communities -as is the case analyzed in this Thesis- may be working over extended territorial networks. In these cases, the declaration, construction and commitment to the honesty of the other and to the whole become very relevant. Thus the evidence shows that in collective markets, there is always a tension between individualism and necessarily generation of trust and cooperation. Therefore the following hypothesis is stated: the probability of surviving during the time -which can be considered an indicator of success-, was related to neighborhood and the kind of institutional networks. If these networks are in an environment that fosters cooperation, the probability of survival is increased. Institutional economics are used as a theoretical framework for the analysis. More specifically, those influenced by Commons, Veblen and Ostrom. In addition, methodologies identified as those of ""second generation"" are also used. These methodologies allow the analysis of economic behavior using the tools of game theory. Finally, we propose to incorporate social network analysis as a way to model collective rationality in an institutional context. Then we shall turn over to the territories where “first generation” methodological tools are applied to look further on the concept of cooperation, trust and self-organizing mechanisms from the significance of the acquired collective experiences. Finally, efforts are made to elaborate a methodological proposal that allows enforcing dialogs about institutional dynamics from its depth, as well as about the experimental stage, and to incorporate social network analysis, in order to build up analytical models. In the search of analytical methods for the different rationalities of collective action within associative economic microsystems a reflection is required on the methods of field analysis and on the interactions between fieldworks and results obtained for theoretical reflection in economics."
"The dissertation consists of three studies devoted to the dividend policy of European listed firms. The first essay investigates: (i) the determinants of dividend payments; (ii) the change in the dividend payment behavior of firms over time; and (iii) factors that are responsible for the decrease in the proportion of dividend payers in Europe. By using listed firms from 21 European countries between 1991 and 2010, we want to determine whether European dividend payers follow the same declining trend as US ones. Furthermore, this analysis provides us the opportunity to study the factors that are important in the determination of dividend policy in Europe. The second essay investigates the factors that are responsible for long term (permanent) dividend policy changes by European listed firms. In this essay we examine the factors that motivate lasting changes in dividend policies, i.e. that lead a regular dividend payer to stop payments permanently, or conversely that lead a never paid firm to adopt a policy of regular dividend payments. The third essay investigates the empirical validity of the dividend signaling hypothesis. In a first step we examine the association between dividend changes and future earnings changes for the full sample. In a second step we consider only those dividend change announcements that are followed by unexpected changes in stock prices during the three days period around dividend change announcements. The changes in stock prices should be in the direction of dividend changes if we assume that market forces react only to dividend change announcements, which have information content about future earnings."
"The thesis is about researching of the consequences of the tourism development in the Kyrgyzstan. The Kyrgyz tourism has a soviet history as well as a development appropriating the market rules, where the tourism had taken his place. The mass tourism attracts more than one million persons to the mountain lake named Issyk-Kul on 1600 meters above the sea level. The advantage and at the same time it's weakness is the unique nature of the lake. The confrontation appeared between the ecology (fragile environment), the economy (local population very dependent from tourism) and the control of natural resources by government structure. From this perspective, the author is answering the question: is it possible to develop the sustainable tourism in Issyk-Kul, in Kyrgyzstan? Could the local institutions realize and establish the new rules of a sustainable development? The author tries to answer these questions and to understand the local process with the new institutional theory, for the reason that the tourism is developing well but in the chaotic way without support and regulation of the government. In reality, the «rules» were edited and accepted officially but in the realization stage, they are not respected by the population and local organizations. The institutions are being weak are not much developed. The author will try to explain this situation by the originality and complexity of the tourist sector and by absence of the State governance (in local and national level) in the tourism promotion in international area and without any helps/supports for local tourism companies. This thesis tries not only to definite problems and risks of tourism but to give solutions and ways to ameliorate the State governance, policy and interventions which are important for any tourist sector. In this new market, Kyrgyz tourism can find excellent place with the concept of sustainable tourism and become a competitive international destination in the long-term perspective."
"Managers who commute internationally represent an emerging category of personnel. During their international missions, they commute weekly between their headquarters and other worldwide locations. They are neither expatriates, nor sedentary managers. Who exactly are they? What organizational policies and procedures have been implemented to manage and help them? Are their difficulties known and recognized? So many questions that the literature has not yet addressed, whereas the use of shortterm international mobility has increased by 10% since 2002 and a further mobility intensification is foreseen? in the next five years (20% increase). Following an exploratory objective, our research focused on the characterization of the managers who commute internationally and their relationship with the workplace. We utilized several methods (qualitative and quantitative methods, use of the diary study) and complementary theoretical frameworks (Job-Demands – Resources Model (Demerouti and al., 2001) and Psychological Contract (Rousseau, 1989)). Our work consisted of three studies. The first quantitative study (1.841 participants), lead through a partnership with APEC, examined the contours and characteristics of the managers who commute internationally, highlighting the similarity of their level of exhaustion and emotional well-being with that of national commuters and sedentary managers. It confirmed that this category of personnel, more diversified than the expatriates, more feminized, experts as well as managerial profiles, was characterized by a specific behavior. Through the collection of life stories (1 0 participants), the second study defined the psychological contract of the managers who commute internationally: those that sacrificed their time, to the detriment of their private life, in exchange of professional career and enrichment. Conflicts between private and professional life emerged when the international commuting threatened the family well-being; in this situation, spousal support was considered a primary resource. The third study (30participants), a diary study, highlighted the importance of certain resources to manage daily this kind of mobility: professional opportunities, development and psychological detachment limited the burnout level during the mission. Finally, recommendations were addressed in order to improve the organizational valorization of the managers who commute internationally. Indeed, these later are the intermediary between the headquarters and the subsidiaries of multinationals, they diffuse the organizational information and culture. They represent a fundamental intangible value that the organization has to care of."
"This dissertation focuses on studying the behavior of a particular case of tourists who had a memorable experience during their trip. These are tourists who have suffered of a culture shock. It aims to identify factors that can cause a culture shock during the tourism experience. It aims to better define the concept of culture shock and how the tourism hospitality may impact it.To this end, we used the triangulation methods. 170 testimonies were collected through the netnography method, 12 life stories and 13 individual interviews were conducted. They have been analyzed by a content analysis and have contributed to propose a redefinition of culture shock and to identify three groups of factors affecting the experience of culture shock: (1) the tourism hospitality (2) individual factors and (3) situational factors."
"The thesis is composed of three research articles. Based on a common theoretical and modeling foundation, by means of computational simulation, these three essays study different subjects relating to firm dynamics under the impact of financial constraints and macroeconomic fluctuations. Respectively, the first article explores functioning of market selection mechanism, the second focuses on firms’ Research and Development (R&D) investment patterns, the third analyzes effects of economic stimulus policies on firm dynamics. The research results demonstrate that the combination of presence of financial constraints and macroeconomic fluctuations may have significant effects on firm dynamics in the context of competitive market. From different angles of analysis, the effects could reveal failure of market selection mechanism, market structure distortion which disfavors firms’ R&D investment, and unequal repercussions of an economic stimulus on firms in recession, especially to the disadvantage of young and small ones."
"The theoretical framework of this thesis is the industrial economics applied to the analysis of technological innovation. Its main purpose is to assess the effects of competitiveness clusters policy on the incentives of firms to innovate. In particular, it aims to understand the informational mechanisms by which this new industrial policy impacts the levels of R&D investment of firms and their activities. The first chapter presents the general framework of the thesis and explains the elements of economic theory underlying the emergence of R&D based-clusters. The second chapter, our first theoretical contribution, analyzes the effects of clusters on R&D investments of firms which cooperate at the R&D stage and compete a la Cournot on product market in a two-stage game. The third chapter, our second theoretical contribution, focuses on the effects of the cluster in vertical relationship between a supplier of technology and integrators. The fourth chapter is intended to and illustrations for the theoretical results through informations gathered from actors of competitiveness clusters, specially in the case of Minalogic at Grenoble (Isere France)."
"This PhD dissertation deals with the evolution of the institutional and organizational framework of the Russian oil indThis PhD dissertation deals with the evolution of the institutional and organizational framework of the Russian oil industry during the period 1992-2012. Its main objective is to characterize and reinterpret the increasing involvement of the national oil companies (NOCs), Rosneft and Gazpromneft, in the upstream activities observed since the middle of the 2000's. Relying on the New Institutional Economics framewrokd, we argue that the increasing involvement of the Russian NOCs can be characterized as a change from a liberal oil governance structure to a hybrid oil governance structure. We show that this organizational evolution must be interpreted as the feasible reform that can be implemented by the federal authorities for dealing with the incoherence between the liberal governance structure defined at the beginning of the transition process and the Russian institutional environment."
"This PhD dissertation focuses on the modernization of the urban water systems in Europe (UWSE). Since the end of the 1990's, this reregulation of the UWSE has transformed the European regulatory framework of water management. It is driven by two mains objectives: improving of the governance process and implementing a sustainable path for the UWSE. Present day, intermediate assessments highlight a need for analytical characterization and explanation of the UWSE's modernization, in order to home in on the unanticipated effects. Thus, the PhD thesis analyses the effects of the UWSE's modernization in its organizational and sustainable dimensions. The goal of the PhD is to provide an interpretation of the modernization impacts on the UWSE governance structure and on the efficiency of the reforms from a sustainability point a of view. Rooted in an institutional economics approach, our methodology consists in a comparative analysis of the German, French and English models of the UWSE. Two phases structure this methodology. The first focuses on empirical observation. The phenomena that characterize the modernization are identified and enunciated as stylized facts. The second phase theoretically explains these phenomena. Regarding the contributions and limits of the different institutionalisms, we choose to mobilize the New institutional economics here to deal with the organizational aspects and Institutional resources regimes to address the sustainable dimension of the UWSE's modernization. We argue that the modernization of the UWSE involves a transformation of their coordination modalities, at the same time; it is intensifying and it leads the sustainability problems to focus on the economic pillar. At the organizational level, we support that, on the one hand, modernization tends to depoliticize UWSE and that, on the other hand, the degree of integration of its principles in the UWSE is positively correlated with a resilient socio-institutional dynamics. These two phenomena ensue essentially from a hybridation of the institutional arrangements in the direction of the market pole. In the UWSE, the change of the contractual forms and the attenuation of the property rights lead to a reduction of the State's direct control and to an augmentation of the actors' ability to adapt quickly. Regarding the potential of sustainability, a lack of coherence in reregulation of UWSE accounts for the pessimistic prospects. We show a paradox which manifests itself in the intrinsic inability of the modernization to maximize the UWSE's potential of sustainability. If the development of the regulation is supposed to improve the governance quality, in this case, it comes with a mechanical increase of the costs of coordination which hampers the achievement of a sustainable path."
"The opening of the Colombian economy, decided in 1990, was supposed to promote a new model of growth and development based on exports (and Foreign Direct Investment). This dissertation argues that the opening was not made in order to promote growth and development, and that these two phenomena did not live up to what was expected. This result is based on an International Political Economy approach: taking into account power relationships may give a better explanation of economic phenomena. The first chapter shows that the structural characteristics of the Colombian economy made its opening unable to generate growth and development. This assertion is based on the analysis of the lack of competitiveness and of the institutional flaws of the Colombian economy, as well as on the potential increase in the spatial inequalities of development resulting from the opening. The second chapter thus highlights that the opening aimed at achieving some objectives peculiar to the United States. These objectives are made of economic considerations (typically the access to foreign markets and to raw materials) as well as political ones (dealing with the threats caused by Marxist guerrilla groups within the framework of the American foreign policy). This second chapter explains a series of means at the disposal of the United States to obtain the opening. These means go from coercion (such as sanction threats) to legitimation (to give rise to a Colombian pro-opening government). The third chapter shows that the opening did not lead to an export-led growth. On the contrary, it led to an unstable growth regime. The latter is based on the foreign capital flows. The latter feed the purchase of real estate assets by credit. The housing sector is thus stimulated, which in turn stimulates other economic activities, within the framework of spill-over effects. However, when foreign capital flows lack, real-estate asset purchases are penalized, thus preventing the expansion of the housing sector and eventually of aggregate production itself (spill-over effects no longer work). However, given the power relationship exercised by the United States, the Colombian government had to purchase American military equipment massively, in order to fight against the Colombian guerrillas. By doing so, the economic policy could not stabilize the economy at that time. Besides, the subsequent intensification of the conflict increased the violence within the Colombian territory, thus leading to the migration of skilled workers and to the destruction of infrastructures. The recession had thus been exacerbated. This scenario occurred a few years after 1990, resulting in the worst economic crisis of the 20th century in Colombia with a -5 % recession in 1999. The fourth chapter questions the changes followed by the production and exchange structures because of the opening, to show that these changes did not really contribute to development. Colombia tends to neglect its historic international specialization in coffee and other cultures like wheat, rice, barley, sorghum or cotton, to privilege other cultures whose positive effects on development are lower.  As regards the industries of extraction of raw materials (in particular hydrocarbons), they are oriented toward exportation but they promote few development. In addition, the Colombian productive system may lack of this type of input in the future. Finally, if the manufacturing industry was able to increase at the rate of the growth regime, it owes it to the protection still remaining with the differential treatment for developing countries in the World Trade Organization, and less to the export opportunities given by the opening. When this treatment will be eliminated or at least decreased, a whole part of the Colombian economy will be threatened."
"The new information and communication technology especially the uprising of the Web 2.0 gives opportunity for the co-creation of value between businesses and their customers. The “online co-creation communities” is one of the many varieties of co-creation of value identified in the literature. Meanwhile, the majority of researches were conducted by the tangible goods suppliers (Like the sportswear for Nike, or car manufacturing for BMW). The objective of this research is to understand in depth the concept of value co-creation when applied to the tourism industry and to identify opportunities that the tourists and destinations could have working together through online community interactions. To resolve this issue, three basic theory elements were put into place: co-creation of value, online community, and the touristic experience. A case study based on the qualitative approach - performed within Regional office of the Analamanga tourism ( Madagascar) - enabled us to clarify this issue."
"Fully in line with the international financial crisis on the one hand, and with the discussions on the reform of banking regulations issued by Basel III on the other, this thesis focuses on the concept of market discipline in the banking sector, one of the pillars of Basel accords. The thesis seeks, in particular, to answer the following question: can bank shareholders be considered as potential source of market discipline or, conversely, as actors frustrating the objectives of regulators? Using two empirical studies conducted on a sample of 247 European banks over a period from 2004 to 2006, this study investigated the determinants of banks failure probability (as a measure of bank risk) and the shareholder disciplinary role (through the effect of charter value on banks risk-taking). Results highlight that: (1) the solvency ratio (Basel I and II ratio) is not a robust indicator of bank failure, (2) other criteria (others than capital adequacy), such as the asset quality, the profitability or the liquidity, can play an important role in the determination of bank failure probability (3) the charter value constrain the risk-taking of banks which confirms the effectiveness of shareholders discipline (4) that the charter value discipline is totally ineffective for large systemic banks (TBTF). These results converge globally with the Basel III reform which aims, in particular, to revise the composition of regulatory capital and apply special treatment on systemic banks. This doctoral work brings theoretical contributions which add to bank market discipline literature as well as operational contributions in the form of recommendations for regulators and supervisors of banking system."
"This thesis develops an innovative approach of corruption in order to capture the complex reality of the phenomenon and explain its persistence in the emerging world. After a critical analysis of the economic orthodoxy of corruption, i.e. the most common understanding of corruption based on a patchwork of theoretical approaches culminating with the model of good governance, we emphasise the weakness of attention on structural factors. In our research we conducted expert's opinion survey (Delphi method) and multidimensional exploratory statistical analysis (factoral analysis) which led to new interpretations of the observed phenomenon. Relying on lessons of contemporary heterodox schools (unified within the institutionalist political economy described by A.Caillé), building a positive and comprehensive approach based on holindividualism, we propose a structuro-institutionalist analysis of corruption. With a renewed paradigm on rationality and coordination of economic agents we rebuilt the interpretative framework of corruption. In this regard, we have developed the concept of institutionalised corruption that describes situations where corruption is no longer a deviance but a rule of behaviour. We studied the mechanisms of institutionalised corruption by highlighting the role of cultural attitudes, of inherent principles in social networks and neo-patrimonial characteristics of contemporary states. In this way, we explain the origins of corruption referring to its historicity and embededness (cultural, social, institutionnal), the operating mechanisms based on hybrid coordination, as well as the effects and ambiguous ties between institutionalised corruption and economic growth. Our dynamic analysis of corruption focuses on transformation patterns in neo-patrimonial systems through the understanding of institutional evolutions, where the path dependency and actions of politico-economic clans explain resistance and reproduction of corrupt systems. We suggest scenarios to get out of clientelism in neo-patrimonial states, where we put forward issues and levers of gradual and endogenous evolutions. In our analysis we emphasise the role of clientelism in democratic construction (a paradoxal vector), where reciprocity networks make democratisation possible. We highlighted two key moments in a virtuous evolution: the decentralisation (or dispersion) of powers among clientelist networks and the diversification of autonomous networks resources, which are notably possible throught integration in global economy. The thesis leads to a set of concrete proposals for improving the relevance of anti-corruption programmes. We reconsider the role of international integration and highlight the superiority of the bottom-up programmes in the fight against corruption, which must be based on the gradual evolution of societal structures. The significance of our analysis exceeds the emerging world and is applicable to different economic systems. Indeed, institutionalised corruption is not specific to emerging or developing countries and therefore can not be reduced to the dynamic of development."
"This research deals with a type of innovation largely neglected in the literature: organizational innovation, also called ""innovation management"" or ""managerial innovation."" The objective is to explain the adoption of this type of innovation by identifying not only its internal and external antecedents, but also its relationship to technological process innovation, with which it shares common characteristics. The model is based on the integrative view of innovation which presents three main advantages: (1) contrary to the linear view of innovation, it does not consider organizational innovation as a second-order innovation; (2) beyond R&D efforts alone, it allows for the integration of new antecedents and their interaction effects, and (3) it enriches the explanation of organizational innovation adoption assuming that innovation is adopted synchronously or complementarily. We used a multi-methodological approach, a qualitative study based on six case studies of industrial firms and a quantitative study using different econometric methods. Lean Management is the concrete form of organizational innovation we studied in the four empirical articles. The contributions of this research are threefold. Firstly, beyond the traditional internal and external antecedents, we show that human resource management practices, firms’ absorptive capacity and external knowledge sources play a crucial role in organizational innovation adoption. Secondly, this research demonstrates that it is essential to take into account the interactions between internal and external antecedents in order to better understand adoption processes, some of them being complementary or substitutes. Thirdly, the study shows that organizational innovation adoption is consistent with the integrative view of innovation since it is dependent of the adoption of technological process innovation, without being strictly complementary. These two types of process innovations, organizational and technological, are also found to be driven by similar antecedents. These results lead to managerial recommendations for a better management of organizational innovation adoption."
"The aim of this thesis is to explore a new emerging technology, now gaining success in organization, called Field Force Automation (FFA) that belongs to an ever-widening, area called the Mobile Business (M-Business), a term that encompasses all kinds of mobile applications addressed to companies. This success is mainly related to its capacity for connecting Field workers, like technicians, the Fire Brigade, truck drivers and many others to corporate organizations. These workers were previously working in disconnected mode, but can now access, collect and process data remotely and in real-time. As a result, this new way of technological connectivity allows companies to increase their performance by increasing technician productivity and reducing travel-related costs. However, despite these advantages, its use is problematic, especially for the communities of technicians because its implementation implies fundamental changes of their work context, particularly concerning coordination. Before the use of these technologies, technicians went to the central station in order to get their workload. However, with the use of this technology, they can start working directly from home. In doing so, organizations applied a positive technical change but overlooked the human dimension, more precisely the collaboration between the technicians, which increases efficiency at work by exchanging experiences, discussing problems and solutions and the usual friendly interaction which gives team cohesion. According to the socio-technical approach, missing this social structure in the implementation of this new technology condemns it to failure. It is through this observation that this research project has taken shape with the aim of exploring how and why accentuating the technical dimension at the expense of the social one leads to the failure of the Information Systems (IS) innovation and decreases the overall performance of the organization in question. To analyze this problematic we applied a socio-technical theory, applied to organizational change because it argues that technical change alone can negatively impact the work performance whereas socio-technical change can impact an organization’s performance positively. Multiple-case design is required to compare these two cases and confirm or refute the above theory. France Télécom was the company selected because those types of change could be observed separately and subsequently compared. The results of this research take the form of concrete examples from the real world of what we can call technical and socio-technical change."
"The aim is to contribute to the research agenda of “Strategy As Practice” taking a practice perspective and showing how practitioners are also engaged in the creation process or strategizing for their own professions and their institutional positions. After a long period of stability, the French stock exchange environment and its associated practices have, for over two decades now, co-evolved very quickly. One category of stock market professionals has been particularly impacted: the brokers, historically at the heart of the Stock Exchange. On French financial markets, the former agents de change have become brokerage companies with some disruptions of professions and an increasing place for others and their practices. If the usefulness of brokerage as an intermediation activity has been examined by finance, interesting developments in the sociology of finance have also enabled the social construction perspective but there is a lack of studies in the strategic management."
"The thesis has the ambition to explain the complex relationships between the tourist development of the heritage and the territorial development and to determine the conditions in which tourism can be a vector of territorial development in two regions in Algeria, one in Kabylie where tourism is under developed despite the existence of an important heritage potential, the other in Tassili n'Ajjer where tourism is at the beginning of a promising development. More precisely, through the relation between heritage, tourism and territorial development, we have studied the question to know how the tourist development of the heritage resources of Bejaïa and Djanet has been designed and implemented and what territorial dynamic has resulted on each of these two territories. The results of this work have shown, in the case of Bejaïa, a process of tourist development heritage which has mobilized generic and limited resources. It prefigures an area of tourist development with few relations with the land: development of generic resources, local entrepreneurship with potential projects, but without specific resources, very limited mobilization of the local socio-cultural in tourism…In the case of Djanet, this process has allowed the implementation at a less and less significant scale of a territorial development. This development occurs through the mobilization of specific resources and the creation of territorial resources, the affirmation of the local population as development actors, the dynamic of local learning, the regulation of the tourist activity, the geographical, organizational and institutional proximities held by the tourist local companies, the opening on the international…"
"The objective of this thesis is to study the triptych of liberalization, globalization and financialization of modern capitalism which has not only came up with distressing consequences for developing and emerging economies during 1990s, but also devastating crisis for developed economies during 2000s - economies with ‘apparently' well-developed financial systems. In this aim, multi-pronged body of theoretical and empirical research has been identified, synthesized and analyzed to present a unique debate focusing on unstable and factitious nature of neo-liberal and finance-led capitalism, developed during last four decades. This dissertation has particular implications for economic growth and development as well as for financial stability in developing and emerging economies which also adopted this modern capitalism. In this aim, this thesis has been divided into four chapters. First chapter is dealing with the relationship between finance and growth. In this regard, evolution of key ideas, theories and empirical research is presented to reach at the concept of financial repression and its implications for developing and emerging economies. Second chapter has analyzed the propositions for financial liberalization with particular emphasis on Washington Consensus and financial globalization as well as the opposition against financial liberalization with particular emphasis on critique by new structuralists and Institutionalists. Third chapter is closely focused on the implications of series of crises and instability in liberalized and open financial markets of emerging economies of Asia and Latin America during late 1990s. Final chapter is using the incidence of current crisis in developed economies to explore the weak foundations of global financial structure and its implications for neoliberal form of finance-led capitalism which demands more consistent financial framework."
"The company of the future will not have the same characteristics as today! Among the many levers of change, the business model is a recent concept familiar to practitioners and academics. They have a strong interest for it. The business model is a mental framework that describes how the business works, specifically how the company created and capture value (Teece, 2010). Technological innovation is also a lever that sometimes requires business model innovation (Chesbrough 2002). When technology is at an embryonic stage, the entrepreneur faces uncertainty. He does not know yet what will offer its technology deployed. On the academic point of view, the literature has focused on the components ant its mechanisms of evolution. However, as a mental framework, the business model is a model (Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010) and a model used to think (Le Moigne, 1999). Returning to the basic goals it serves, we ask the question: how do we reason in the process of designing business model? The research follows the principles of a science research organization design (Hatchuel 2001, Romme 2003; Morhman 2007) around a single case study and a mode of collaborative research. The management instrumentation combines several methods (brainstorming session, technique of narration, setting the value network card and financial modeling). To answer this question, we set up a methodology in which we collected the speech process instrumented business model scenarios at Schneider Electric. Calorie case is a case of valuation of an innovative technology that can achieve energy savings on production machines cold. This case is of interest because it is a real problem of business model. Through the dominant business model of the group, the technology is not valued at fair value. This case was the opportunity to design two scenarios of innovative business models in partnership with a team of Schneider Electric innovation. We analyzed the patterns of reasoning process using an analytical framework that we built: the model modes of reasoning. The results allow us to show quantitatively the contribution of each of these modes of reasoning and their evolution during this process. In a narrative style, we also offer a qualitative interpretation. The academic contribution lies in the fact that we hope to have given the keys to understanding the design process of a business model with the model of reasoning we have provided the scientific community. Moreover, we show that the design of business model is primarily a systemic approach. For practical contribution, this work proposes a method for practitioners to design functional business model scenarios."
"Andean region consists of four Latin American countries: Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru unified within a regional association, Andean Pact, in 1969, that became the Andean Community of Nations (CAN) in 1996. The purpose of this thesis is to identify the regional process that is actually being implemented within CAN. In this aim, we use the typology of regional processes established by Figuière and Guilhot (2006, 2007, and 2009) as the starting point of analysis. This analytical framework leads to identify two distinct pillars in regional economic integration: intensification of intra-regional economic flows and institutionalization of interstate relations, namely regionalism and regionalization. This analysis will show that, even though numerous institutions with various purposes emerged within CAN during the last four decades, the proportion of intra-regional trade did not exceed 10% during this period. These results reflect on the one hand, the phase-in of regionalism in depth, insofar as the regulations that are developed by regional institutions cause the harmonization of practices within nation States, and on the other hand, the absence of a genuine regionalization.. On the other hand, they point to a lack of a sound regionalization. Therefore the ongoing CAN process cannot be qualified as a regional economic integration (IER). This discrepancy between a more sophisticated regional institutional framework and a regionalization that does not take off may partially be explained by the significant economic attractiveness of the US economy."
"In Cameroon, the sequence of reforms in the health sector has reinforced an ideological wavering between two opposing currents: a socio-universal that promotes equity, and a neoliberal, which militates for greater economic efficiency of existing systems. Articulating two concerns which are, the worsening of health inequalities as consequence of policy choices made on the efficacy of services without taking into account factors that support the demand, and the form of organization of the health system arising from an imperfect translation of major international principles, this thesis aims to contributing to a critical reflection on the process, the implementation and the results produced by these health policies. To determine Cameroonian specificity, we inscribe them in a triple theoretical field. The neo-institutionalist approach, mobilize to grasp the importance of the economic history and its influence on the evolution of the health system, which allows understanding the conditions for policy change. The “referentials” approach to policy analysis in order to apprehend the foundations of the new public policy, including the understanding of how interests and ideas are formatted by institutions. An effort to illuminate the policy game is undertaken to appraise the mediation of political entrepreneurs, thereby testing empirically the “top-down hypothesis”. Finally, the theories of justice help to argue for the existence of an imbalance between health supply and demand which undermines health outcomes, and reinforces the conflict efficacy versus equity. Indeed, our work aims to provide some answers to three main questions: (i) Why (triggers) and how (dynamic) health public policies are influenced in their construction and implementation by economic policies? (ii) What are the outcomes of induced changes by the global referential (macroeconomic framework) on sectoral referential that requires a more equitable distribution and access to health services? (iii) What lessons can we learn from the knowledge of the interrelationships between the dynamics of poverty reduction and the persistence of inaccessibility to health care in order to improve the evaluation of public policies? From a number of quantitative and qualitative indicators, the robustness of the new policy is questioned following prospects regarding health distribution and accessibility. Therefore, we emphasize the difficulty of the public policy to achieve satisfactory results both in terms of efficacy or equity due to the institutional and organizational system in which it is designed and implemented. Three epistemic communities acting on a nonstructural basis are identified and analyzed through a robust qualitative material that enables us to grasp the existence of a paradigmatic conflict emerged from how different groups are positioning themselves and interpret reality in order to put in coherence the sectorial referential and the global market-based one which appears to be rather spontaneous and mandatory. Statistical and econometric works to measure more precisely the inequalities and determinants of access and use of health services by the population supports the idea of a widening of inequalities by the health policies maintained by strong regressive mechanisms. The analysis of the determinants of occurrence of catastrophic health expenditures also confirms this. We mobilize thereafter an additional material to assess the allocative efficiency and efficacy of public spending on health as well as their impact on the use of services and benefits revealed from their use."
"We construct an agent-based computer simulated financial market. Trading in this market is not continuous. The market price is formed using a limit-order book. The modelled investors receive biased information and they attempt to maximize their wealth. Different traders, from noise to chartist and informed, coexist in the same market. We show how stylized facts can be formed by the presence of chartists or a simple lag in investor information. Price bubbles can arise when market prices are dominated by technical traders. Interestingly we show that well informed investors can earn more if the adopt, in special situations, a technical strategy. Using our results we propose a new theorem for market dynamics called “sometimes efficient markets”."
"This thesis is dedicated, on one hand, to the conceptualization of the entrepreneurial spirit and the identification of the factors of its development at the university, on the other. The theoretical study led us to consider the entrepreneurial spirit as a mental process composed of a set of attitudes and feelings of skills (or competencies) favorable to an entrepreneurial orientation. The university, along with other factors of socialization, could develop such by evolving towards an entrepreneurial university for the adoption of an entrepreneurial orientation. To this effect, it is brought to adopt entrepreneurship practices at both at the internal and external levels of its environment. We conducted a preliminary empirical investigation through semi-directive interviews with 24 persons in charge of the Tunisian universities so as to investigate, identify and encircle the factors of development of the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit a Tunisian universities. Besides, the hypothetic-inductive approach allowed us to stack the theoretical propositions stemming from the literature with the main results of investigation. In so doing, we managed to refine and enrich the conceptual model through the addition of new variables: • The university type influences the development of the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit; • The importance of the role of the person in charge of the university in the development of the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit for the university: it is called to become an entrepreneur; • The importance of the refitting of the study schedule; • At the level of the entrepreneurial education: importance of the original and playful pedagogies and those based on TRICK and the training(formation) of the trainers in entrepreneurship; • Integration of the communication with and between students and their motivation; • Importance to knot partnerships universities / universities and more contact with the society. The proposed conceptual model refined by the exploratory study can serve as reference or point of departure for later researches aiming at studying the development factors of the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit at the university. It can also serve as a tool given to universities intending to introduce and concretize a policy for the promotion of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial spirit within their context. The originality of this thesis is to offer a new conception of the entrepreneurship: a state of mind, a domain of teaching and education and an option of possible career. So, its value consists in contributing to the conceptualization of the entrepreneurial spirit, in feeding the reflection around the factors of development of the entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial spirit at the university and in approaching new concepts: entrepreneurial university and entrepreneurial orientation of the university. Keys words University, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial spirit, conceptualization, entrepreneurial education, factors of development, entrepreneurial orientation."
"Since the mid-1970s, rural areas have experienced significant change. Beside traditional activities, new functions (chiefly housing and recreation) have emerged and become important. At the same time, society has experienced changes such as acknowledging environmental issues and a reduced working time. This context has brought about changes in tourism demand as well, and made rural areas more attractive destinations. However, rural change has not been homogenous. Therefore, the critical question regards the role of tourism in territorial dynamics and rural area revitalization. Given the links identified in the literature between tourism and rural development, it seems necessary to use a theoretical framework that relies on both a territorial approach and the capability approach. In this dissertation the notion of territorial capabilities is defined as opportunities that arise between individuals and their territory. To analyse the impact of tourism on marginal area capabilities, we used a mixed methods approach. First, secondary data and principal component analysis were used to analyse the relationship between synthetic indicators and create a typology of Rhône-Alpes rural areas. Second, this analysis was compared to a field survey based on semi-guided interviews with local stakeholders in three study areas. Two main conclusions may be drawn from this work. Firstly, we suggest that the capability approach can be used to perform regional diagnostics. Second, we stress that tourism can act as a catalyst for social capital in rural areas. Following this conclusion, we would recommend that if tourism is to foster rural development, it needs to be planned and managed by local authorities. Then, the tourism project itself truly becomes the catalyst of local development."
"Nowadays, enterprises are facing more changes，uncertainties but airlines companies are facing the greatest challenges. There is no systemic and comprehensive researches on the strategy risk in airline industry. Thus this article mainly studies strategy management from the risk perspective There are three main parts. Firstly, this article proposed one strategy risk factors identification system for Chinese airlines companies based on the strategy position, strategy choice and strategy implementation. Workrisk analysis and expert interview were used to extract 16 strategy risks, and then the transformation conditions from strategy risk factors to strategy risks were analyzed. In the second part, ANP was used to get the weights for 16 strategy risks, and then the airline industry strategy risk levels were evaluated in three layers, strict control layer, control layer and watching layer. Combined with fuzzy evaluation method, this article evaluated the strategy risks of 12 Chinese airlines companies and analyzed their differences. Based on the identification and evaluation, one decision model was proposed. In the third part, the study implemented the empirical research in the case study; i.e. on Chinese Eastern Airline. The strategy risk level evaluated and the strategy risks were analyzed. This article innovated in the following aspects. This research applied the strategy risk theory into airline industry and the case study. Secondly it combined the qualitative method with quantitative method, using ANP and fuzzy evaluation methods. Thirdly, two core identification dimensions (strategy risk factors identification and transformation condition analysis) were proposed. According to the evaluation results, the Chinese airline strategy risks were categorized into three layers, and strategy risks of different airlines analyzed."
"The purpose of this thesis is to show the primacy of the theory over the empirics and prove that econometrics cannot be decisive to question the theory. For this, we rely on the limits of econometrics highlighted in discussions of monetary policy since the 1960s. We adopt an approach based on epistemological arguments to show that these debates go beyond the cleavage theory/empirics and that they integrate a difference of vision as to the usefulness of an empirical model. The research program of the Cowles Commission was formed around a particular articulation of three fundamental elements: a theoretical repository of Keynes' General Theory, a formal model based on the relative consensus on the IS-LM diagram and econometric techniques to estimate the parameters of this model. It is the nature and the degree of interdependence between these three elements that are contested by the monetarists and supporters of the VAR modeling. While Keynesians make a clear distinction between the theoretical model and the estimated model, this distinction is not clear and does not seem relevant to the monetarists. Sims (1980) criticizes the structural models of the Cowles Commission for including too many theoretical hypotheses empirically untested. He proposes to review the exogeneity assumptions through direct and specific econometric tests. However, the empirical indeterminacy of causality in a VAR, linked to the problem of observational equivalence (Basmann, 1965), requires the adoption of an identification scheme on the basis of a theoretical a priori to identify the monetary policy shocks. This is an extreme case of the problem of under-determination of theory by data raised by the Duhem-Quine thesis (Duhem 1906, Quine, 1951). Furthermore, Hoover (2009) notes that the impulse response analysis in a VAR provides a good example of what Cartwright (2007) calls “counterfactual impostor”. The development of the Error Correction Models and cointegrated VAR models has renewed the analysis of monetarist proposals. However, the links between the proposals for cointégration, the notions of long-term equilibrium and short term disequilibrium are rarely interpreted in the context of a rigorous and fully specified theoretical model. According to Faust and Leeper (1994), the identification of a model by imposing constraints may not be fruitful when economic theory does not clearly distinguish the short-term and long-term dynamics. Faust and Whiteman (1997) note the absence of an arbitration criterion in these approaches apparent in the presence of conflict between the theoretical principle and the adjustment to the data; otherwise subordination of the theory to the econometrics. Alongside the issue of identification, the Lucas critique (1976) is the second fundamental criticism facing the use of econometric models. Lucas (1980, 1986) adopts a new epistemological posture considering the theoretical model as a 'fiction' and not as a set of proposals on the behavior of a real economy. He supports the idea of explaining the cycle in terms of discipline of equilibrium (Lucas, 1977). The DSGE models, that constitute the fundamental models of the New Synthesis theory, are strongly influenced by Lucas' methodology and are a continuity of the RBC models (Taouil, 2011). Benati and Surico (2009) demonstrated the superiority of a DSGE model with respect to a structural VAR (SVAR). This failure is a direct consequence of inter-equation restrictions imposed by the rational expectations hypothesis, initially raised by Sargent's critics (1979)."
"Our research area is around the strategic decision within organizations. More precisely, it is applicable as an aid for strategic decision-making and detecting useful information for such decisions. On the one hand, the ‘information from the field' from the contacts between individuals, business meetings, etc. is always essential for managers. On the other hand, national and international newspapers can provide a considerable volume of data that can be defined as the raw data. However, besides these classical sources, gathering information has changed dramatically with the advent of information technology and particularly internet that is related to our research. We chose the area for the acquisition of ‘information from the field' provided by the national daily newspapers: the Colombian newspaper which concerns to our empirical study. In order to detect weak signals of potential internet base issues which help managers to discover and understand their environment, we proposed a research based on “Action Design Research” type and then applied for designing, building and testing an artifact to gain the required information. The artifact has been designed and built in two phases that is included of using theoretical concepts about the data overload, environmental scanning particularly the “anticipatory and collective environmental scanning model” (VAS-IC®) and the desirable characteristics of strategic decision making support systems. After its construction, the artifact applied to real experimentation that has allowed us to evaluate its effectiveness. Afterwards, we improved our knowledge about the relevance of digital data in the decision making process. The results of all the involved decision makers have been able to integrate these new practices into their information needs."
"The objective of my PhD is to better understand the theoretical and empirical mechanisms of organizational-level entrepreneurship, and more precisely “entrepreneurial orientation” (EO). To better comprehend the phenomenon, this dissertation is the succession of four research efforts: - Identify what entrepreneurial orientation is by distinguishing from what it is not (entrepreneurial management) - Understand how the EO construct fits into the main models of firm-level entrepreneurship - Furnish a critical discussion of EO through the synthesis and mapping of existing issues, to unveil that there are actually four conceptualizations behind the term “EO”, among which the original conceptualization by Miller (1983), gone unheard or misunderstood - In line with Miller’s initial intention, I offer a taxonomy of firms according to their gestalt of EO, and the characteristics of each configuration This dissertation aims at contributing to entrepreneurship literature, to strategic management, and to general management by improving our understanding of firm-level entrepreneurship in SMEs."
"The multiplication of financial scandals since year 2000 induced debates and controversies about the governance of public companies. In the contracting paradigm, the debates on corporate governance have largely relied on shareholder value as a dominant model, in which shareholders are the only residual claimants. However, the stakeholder theory builds on the principle that the shareholder-manager agency relationship has to widen to the others stakeholders who intervene in the value creation chain, and that it is necessary to get rid of the hypothesis that shareholders are exclusive residual claimants. This move brings questions about the sharing of the organizational rent, or stakeholder value created by the firm. More specifically, the concept of stakeholder value raises questions about its measurement, its appropriation by the various stakeholders, and about the role of corporate governance mechanisms on that ground. The objective of this research is to investigate the role of firm-specific governance mechanisms (board characteristics, ownership structure) on the creation of stakeholder value on the one hand, and on the distribution of that stakeholder value to the firm and to its explicit stakeholders, on the other hand. Empirical tests are based on a panel of 103 French listed companies observed over three years (2006, 2008, and 2010). The main findings suggest that four mechanisms stand out globally positively associated to the stakeholder value created: board size and board independence, employees' voting rights (shareholder power), and the presence of an Ethics and/or Governance Committee (EGC). In terms of appropriation, two governance mechanisms seem to play a role. Firstly, board size would result in a larger part of the organizational rent captured by shareholders and suppliers, at the expense of customers and the firm itself. Secondly, the presence of an EGC results in a better consideration of the interests of some non-financial stakeholders (customers and employees), whereas the share of rent that is appropriated by financial capital providers (shareholders and debt-holders) decreases. Overall, our results concerning the implementation of an EGC turn out encouraging regarding the capacity of such mechanism to promote effective stakeholder governance within listed companies."
"Improving the conditions of women and men is accompanied by the emergence of different approaches and economic theories. This new situation has also led to an exchange between the North and South. Thus, the economic and theoretical corpus has been enriched in favor of developing countries in particular. Despite the efforts that have been made terms of equality of gender relations and changing laws, it is still difficult to identify this equality in the development. This thesis is part of development economics. Its main objective is to seek the equality of gender relations and their implementation for development in Morocco, through the experience of elected local authorities and the human capital of the Ministry of the Interior. The first part presents the general theoretical framework of economic approaches that are essential for our work of doctoral research. The second part describes the methodological and mobilized tools through the capabilities approach, human capital and discrimination. This section attempts to present the development from below by the role of elected local authorities and development across the top officials of the Central services of the ministry of interior so as to practice the equal gender relations."
"Competitiveness clusters have been established since 2006 and represent a political initiative by the French government to aid businesses and regions and thus improve France’s position in the realm of international economic competition. The goal is to reinforce the industrial fabric in certain regions via a substantial injection of public funds invested in projects linked with innovation and internationalization of enterprises. This dissertation studies the impact of the creation of the “Arve Industries” competitiveness cluster and in particular, the degree of implication of local SMEs in this collective, innovating activity. From a theoretical stand point, we call upon approaches addressing territorial economies due to the intrinsically territorial nature of competitiveness clusters, as well as studies focusing on strategic networks. Harnessing these two perspectives, proximity is presented as an important factor at the root of cooperative interactions between the involved actors (businesses, laboratories and universities) in the technological field. From a technological stand point, this work combines a qualitative exploratory approach based on semi-directive interviews with 22 SME owners and 6 organizations that support local industry, and a quantitative approach based on 68 usable questionnaires. The nature of relationships between SMEs in competitiveness clusters are also studied in terms of cooperation, competition and knowledge sharing."
"During those recent years, we have witnessed profound economic changes that involved a change in organizational boundaries. It is found that the mode of inter-organizational functioning is increasingly relevant, it is presented as the appropriate scope of implementation of new forms of governance for innovation. The research conducted as part of this thesis are part of that context and relate to clusters, as well as collaborative projects related thereto. Working in collaborative mode involves the multiplicity and the discovery of new modes of operation of each other. The inter-organizational collaboration engages a multitude of different actors, working with rhythms as diverse and varied, different corporate cultures, of different and complementary skills, etc.. The clusters assume that members are in a posture of cooperation. The networking of companies and organizations adhering to the poles requires to work together and collaborate on assignments and projects. However, the human resource management within a cluster is not simple: we stated above, the populations in the presence of status and have very different cultures (researchers, entrepreneurs, employees, etc.. ), most people on the poles are neither technically nor paid by the latter, the organization of work on projects of collaborative R & D is specific. Each structure has specific adherent and different challenges. What then of collaboration in a cluster? HRM can observe how does one? It promotes Does collaboration between members?"
"Controlling risks is an important issue for companies. Far from being only the prerogative of natural disasters, the disruptions of today's supply chains can sometimes be caused by minor events amplified by the flaws of increasingly complex industrial organizations, causing severe economic losses.Risk management in supply chains is a recent theme and the proposed solutions are not yet able to meet the needs of practitioners. One of the solutions to analyse risks is using simulation. But, despite its effectiveness to cover the complexity of the chain, it still presents a major weakness which is the difficulty of implementation.The aim of this thesis is to facilitate and to adapt the simulation for risk analysis of supply chains. Thus, we have developed a modeling framework for simulation which enables an easy construction of models of supply chain structure, behavior and if the associated risks. This is done through the proposition of a set of meta-models and libraries, defined on the basis of the SCOR reference model. In addition, we proposed a translation guide for the translation of the conceptual model of supply chains into a simulation model and enabling testing risk scenario. Additionaly, we developed a library of simulation modules.A case study was conducted and the results show the relevance of the proposed approach."
"Despite the growing interest in international entrepreneurship and organizational entrepreneurship as new ways of thinking, academic research in both fields does not seem sufficiently emphasize the underlying processes and dynamics of the accelerated internationalization of SMEs and the formation of their entrepreneurial orientation (EO). This research aims to provide a systemic understanding of entrepreneurial processes of the SMEs by placing the logic of determining export opportunities at the heart of our thinking. The work will conclude by a qualitative model explaining the phenomenon in question.The first part of this thesis is devoted to the theoretical foundations of research, addressing key concepts of our conceptual framework. The second part addresses the problem of empirical research. After an initial work of contextualization, are presented and analyzed the results of a multiple case study, conducted in six young Moroccan exporting SMEs in the agro-industrial sector.The research highlights the internal vectors (knowledge, experience and social capital) and external constraints (nature of the activity and the local market characteristics) as determinants of the accelerated internationalization of young SMEs studied. More importantly, two different configurations of the EO dimensions are described in relation with two distinct logics of determining export opportunities (causal logic vs effectuale logic)."
"This thesis can be said to belong to the research-action which flourishes during the 1970's. It arises from questions coming from the society and uses methodology coming from recent researchers and rooted in the validated theories.In the first paper, we determine which main factors induce the green management in the garment industry. We define internal factors (green cost, green culture, communication skill, ability of green technology innovation) and external factors (government and laws, competitors' environment pressure) for companies and use the expert scoring method and ANP to determine main factors and how they interact.The second paper focuses on the textile industry and proposes a specific dashboard at the plant level to evaluate the environmental, social and economic performances.This dashboard is a first attempt, both on the methodological and data collection front,towards building a global view on the impact of production in the garment industry in China at the level of individual production firms. In particular, the characteristics of some of the firms involved in the supply chain are taken into account. We exemplify our methodology by showing how a small firm has introduced this dashboard in the decision process. Then we propose some guidelines about possible new regulations and enticements for firms to meet new quality standards. Taken together, the dashboard gives insights into the impacts of the processes from a triple angle: economic, social and ecological.The third paper attempts to construct a decision making model for a small garment businesswho face a set of alternative choices. The model deals with multi-criteria from various stakeholders' perspectives to choose suppliers, change machines and switch the energy system.We implement the Prométhée method for a textile factory. Multiple stakeholders are taken into account: CEO, shareholders, local and central governmental authorities."
"Recent research on alternative indicators suggest the need for a fundamental review of the development process of indicators and is also in line with a general movement criticizing an economistic and expert-centered form of rationalization in the field of public policy. This thesis develops on this work and aims to assess how it is possible that these indicators hold an ""alternative"" in terms of rationalization of action.To appreciate the changes within the quantification process, the thesis focuses on an experiment conducted in Grenoble on the construction of sustainable territorial social indicators (IBEST). The first part of the work is theoretical. It establishes a link between the conventional form of indicators, their performative nature, the postulate of the actor's rationality and the rationalization of public policies. It is supplemented by an analysis of the axiological dimension of social choice criteria (well-being, sustainability) based on theories of development that can support the construction of such indicators. The second part provides an analysis of the IBEST experiment through the prism of the conventionalist theoretical framework. It underlines that processes of indicators' development such as the IBEST experiment induce transformations both in regard to the axiological dimension governing the construction of indicators and in terms of scientific and political rationalization. By applying the pragmatic logic of action research, we highlight the added value of articulating a logical investigation and a participatory approach in relation to the operationalization's process of sustainable well-being indicators. To conclude, in addition to the methodological and cognitive contributions related to the hybridization between a quantitative method and a participatory approach, the contribution of this research lies in the light the experimentation sheds on the understanding of institutional dynamics. Indeed, the generalization associated to participatory approaches and, on a broader level, the non-linear quantification process implemented in the IBEST experiment supports the relevance of the concepts of ""background"" and ""interpretive communities"" when it comes to assessing the dynamics at work in such experimentations and to make coherents the notions of legitimacy and ""institutional embeddedness"". This thesis leads to a conception of the institutional dynamics which proceeds by sedimentation and results from a transformation of the approaches and practices of actors in the science and political fields."
"This thesis aims to analyze the capital structure and performance of French family firms going public. From a sample of 90 family firms belonging to CAC All-Tradable from 2010 to 2013, we find that the capital structure of family firms is characterized by a low level of debt with a preference for short-term debt relative to long-term debt. Moreover, the capital structure of family firms is in line with the classical theories of financing, the hypothesis of market timing, the theory of optimal debt ratio and the pecking order theory. Then we analyze the short-term and long-term performance of French family firms going public through Initial Public Offerings. The results show the different expropriation techniques employed by the family firms' owners. On the initial public offering date, the majority of family firms' owners are simultaneously CEOs and Chairmen of boards of directors. After going public, the family firms' owners hold around 80% of the firms' cash flow rights and we observe that the difference between their cash flow rights and their voting rights has increased. First-day underpricing is around 2% which shows that family firms are almost fairly priced upon issuance. The family firms outperform the market index in the first three months of issuance and after the third year. We also find that the ownership and control rights change from pre- to post-IPO date explains the short-term and long-term performance unlike governance mechanisms."
"Based on the development and the theoretical legitimisation of organisational agility model, this research explores the perceptions and representations of managers on organizational agility to clarify and operationalize this construct. To do this, we first get back to the sources of organisational agility that appeared in 1991. This work highlights a strong theoretical foundation based on four agility capabilities: responsiveness, flexibility, quickness, and competence.This theoretical exploration allows us to continue our research in two phases. We first conducted a questionnaire to collect, twenty-five years after the first development of agility, perceptions of managers on the definition of agility capabilities, the practices associated with these capabilities. We compared our results with those of a measurement scale of organizational agility published in the literature in December 2011.Finally, this research provides two major results. First, we observe that managers do not perceive organizational agility as the theoretical developments read in the literature. Managers articulate the different managerial and organizational practices and they do not follow the theoretical developments. The second major result is the improvement of the measurement scale of organisational agility published in 2011. T"
"This thesis analyzes the inflation targeting policy in emerging economies. To be more specific, the developments of this thesis aimed to investigate the conduct, efficiency and performance of the policy of monetary strategy in an instability context. Therefore, we proceed in two steps. First, we study the conduct rule of the inflation targeting policy (Chapter 1), showing how this notion of optimal rule should guide the behaviour of the Central Bank in its decisions of monetary policy, in order to achieve the inflation goal, by emphasizing the role of transparency and credibility of the monetary policy, as a performance criterion, by evaluating the different experiences of the emerging countries that have adopted an inflation targeting and have been able to strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary regime (Chapter 2). Then, in a second step, we distinguish periods of pre-targeting and post-targeting to evaluate the performance of this policy. Thus, we show that inflation targeting is economically efficient if it generates an environmental stability of monetary policy (Chapter 3). Finally, we analyze the efficiency and performance of the inflation targeting policy in emerging economies in times of crisis, taking into account the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 that produced the worst global recession since the 1930s (Chapter 4). We are developing an econometric approach based on a dynamic panel data in order to study the degree of stability of the economic environment targeted countries in a context of instability. Our results show a significant difference in inflation performance with macro-economic performances in a global economic environment characterized by a global financial crisis, and that these differences are generally attributable to the choice of the strategy of monetary policy."
"Necessity entrepreneurs create ventures since they perceive they can find no other suitable work. The number of research articles on the subject has skyrocketed in the 2000s. Some of these papers influence the public policies worldwide, aiming at reducing unemployment by stimulating entrepreneurship, especially at a time of economic crisis. Necessity entrepreneurs are opposed to opportunity entrepreneurs, who pursue profitable market opportunities, in a commonly accepted dichotomy. First part of our doctoral dissertation presents how the « necessity entrepreneurship » concept developed. A second chapter summarizes the current global state of knowledge on necessity entrepreneurship, based on a thorough literature review. Particular focus is placed on the wide range of definitions. In a third part, we demonstrate that the « necessity entrepreneurship » category is not a reliable one. Although widely found in research papers, it is not a solid concept to identify entrepreneurs : its meanings vary according to regions, individuals, social and economic contexts. Fourth chapter of this work proposes a typology of necessity entrepreneurs to illustrate in eight categories the various profiles encountered in the literature. A quantitative exploratory study based on a sample of 1000 French entrepreneurs offers a first validation tool for the typology and gives percentages of entrepreneurs per profile. An operational list of all necessity factors, internal or external, unchangeable or modifiable, has then been developed to measure a degree of criticality and assign a score to necessity entrepreneurs. In order to improve the mentoring of necessity entrepreneurs, to develop their resilience and venture's success, last part of this paper is devoted to an in-depth analysis of necessity entrepreneurial processes. Therefore we used the biographical method in the framework of the effectuation theory. Specific issues and barriers related to necessity entrepreneurial venture set up have been identified, especially concerning resources gathering, funding and stakeholders' involvement. It appears necessity entrepreneurs resort to effectuation spontaneously and by default. However, although effectual principals have been developed based on expert entrepreneurs, it seems that applied by necessity entrepreneurs, they are no guaranty of success at all. As a conclusion, we demonstrate that teaching effectuation should however structure necessity entrepreneurial processes in a straightforward manner, in order to increase self-confidence and self-esteem of necessity entrepreneurs."
"Ecosystems’ preservation and the economic performance of organisations are often considered to be antagonistic. Nevertheless, ecosystems and organisations are interdependent, and they can be seen as part of the same social-ecological system (SES). The goal of our research is to identify the tools that ensure that the SES environmental and economic viability constraints we provide (i.e. ecological resilience and organisations’ profitability) are observed. After highlighting the ecological weakness of conventional neoclassical regulatory tools, we measure the effectiveness of two other categories of tools that have appeared recently and are often praised. The voluntary approaches analysed generally ensure the economic viability of organisations, but their environmental goals, which are variably reached, often ignore the complexity of ecosystems. Among the environmental accounting approaches, those considered as neoclassical regulatory tools pursue objectives that are ecologically inappropriate, whereas heterodox approaches observe our ecological constraints, but entail a significant reform of accounting policies. These results prompt us to elaborate an environmental management model, set to ensure shorter term SES viability. It lies, for its ecological effectiveness, on an adaptive management approach at the territorial level. The competitive disadvantages which might arise are identified in appropriate accounts, and these situations are addressed with using suitable redistributive processes."

"Understanding how companies innovate for positive environment impact and sustainable development is a crucial issue for business and society today. Yet,little is currently known about this particular kind of innovation. The objective of this thesis is to shed light on the specificities of environmental innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in terms of determinants and perceived barriers.The theoretical framework is based on the Porter’s Hypothesis in order to examine the effect of regulation. It is enriched by the RBV and KBV approaches to better take into account SMEs’ capabilities and resources in the adoption of environmental innovation.This research is based on three empirical articles and on a quantitative approach which mobilizes several econometric methods.This thesis contributes to three key findings: (1) Environmentally innovative SMEs perceive more barriers, in more intense and numerous ways, compared to others innovative or non-innovative SMEs; (2) Environmentally innovative SMEs utilize more external knowledge sources than other SMEs; (3) SMEs, like large firms, can adopt environmental innovations proactively because they possess certain capacities.These results lead to public policy and managerial recommendations for more widespread and more effective environmental innovation in SMEs."
"The research presented in this PhD thesis looks at an approach which attempts to merge Lean Management and the implementation of ISO-type certification. This method, that we have called ""Lean Normalization"", proposes a new way of approaching the implementation of ISO standards in a company, using six steps inspired from Lean Management concepts.Once a state of the art of ISO, its history and the different normative versions have been presented, we then analyze the different approaches and definitions of Lean Management.The bibliographic study of both ISO and Lean methods has enabled us to identify the following problem: the attempts to merge ISO and Lean do not lead to any type of formal modelling. We therefore propose an innovative approach which we call ""Lean Normalization"".This approach is composed of the following six steps: Documentary Muda, Right Documents,Design of the Process of Continuous Improvement, Due Quality, Visual Management and Animation of the Quality Management System. The application of our approach in companies has enabled us to highlight the ineffectiveness of conventional audit. Therefore, in the last chapter, we propose a different vision of an audit based on the Organizational Stress Test."
"The Nicaraguan agrifood system organization is strongly influenced by the Peasant Cooperative Movement (MCP) inherited from the Sandinist Revolution. In a context in which the role of family farming and peasant agriculture in development trajectories tend to be reaffirmed, this thesis in political economics offers a prospective reflexion on potential levers to support Ecodevelopment strategies. As the fruit of a qualitative field research, the analysis of the interviews carried out with peasants in three rural areas of Nicaragua enables us to draw a motivational panorama of cooperative organization. This research results firstly in the identification and qualification of Cooperative-LAFS (Cooperative based Localized Agri-Food Systems) dynamics. Secondly, it enables, while bringing together agroecology and radical industrial ecology, to question the part of the ideal-type ecosystem in structuring agrifood systems, as well as in defining and accompanying Ecodevelopment trajectories."
"Purchasing Social Responsibility (PSR) is a topic of current interest. Recent literature development on this topic reflects the increasing interest amongst researchers. However, the existing literature fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PSR implementation process, which is also an issue of interest from a managerial perspective. This thesis aims to address this gap by identifying the antecedents (drivers and barriers) to PSR adoption process. We provide an original conceptual framework, which identifies intra-organizational antecedents to a sustaining adoption and sheds light on the important role of collaboration in buyer-supplier relationship.The empirical methodology is based on five case-studies with companies at different stages of PSR adoption process.The results show that intra-organizational antecedents play a critical role in achieving the set-up and operating phases, while inter-organizational antecedents (buyer-supplier collaboration) appear to be essential for the sustaining phase. This research provides comprehensive guidance for activating these leverages throughout the PSR implementation process, and it helps firms identify their level of PSR adoption."
"The objectives of this work are to analyse different practices of social and solidarity economy that enable African women to move beyond vulnerability. Income generating activities involve both an increase in individual and collective empowerment of women, and in addition - further development of their communities. African women are key agents of change through individual actions, but most of all - though collective once. In Africa, as well as in various countries of the South, female organisations are not only a place for women to gain some economic independence, but a genuine areas of freedom and exchange, that allow them to come out of isolation, to learn new skills, and to have more esteem and self-confidence as individuals in their own rights alongside the men in a patriarchal societies. It is through these activities that women strengthen their role, their social status, and reinforce their femininity and presence Women's organisations, in different degree, manage to gain some success. The positive impact of women's participation in these groups suggests that the individual or collective empowerment of poor women is possible by opting for alternative solutions based on practical and collective actions that develop more capacity and greater freedom. In this sense, Sen's capability approach is relevant to the extent, that it reinforces the importance of women's activities within the social economy, thereby strengthening the gains in terms of empowerment. The main function of female economic organisations is to enable women members to be able to support themselves through mobilisation and redistribution of resources and therefore help them out of poverty. These women who are active in organisations and are often responsible for the family, often seek most financial means to meet their family and social obligations. Through our work, we have identified further significant gains for women as individuals, as well as in a collective, but these gains are less quantifiable. The context of crisis and insecurity gives women's activities a very important social role especially in the South, where the feminisation of poverty is important."
"This thesis proposes a multidimensional analysis of the effect of social capital on the tourism sector dynamics at the territorial level. The objective of this work is to question the capacity of local actors to mobilize their stocks of social capital in a dynamic of development of the tourism offer based on local resources. For this we use the theoretical framework of social capital theory as well as the territorial economy, in order to illuminate new perspectives on the potential of tourism development based on local resources. This framework is applied to the understanding of the links between social capital and the tourist offer in a seaside resort of the Syrian coastal region. To enable us to see the role of social capital in the dynamics of the local tourism offer in the studied seaside resort, we proceed with the development of an indicator of '' the effect of social capital on the tourist offer ''. We also present a study of a network of actors from the resort engaged in the same activity. In this study we discern how norms and principles such as reciprocity or reputation affect the activity of actors.Different levels of conclusions can be drawn from our work: on the role of social capital in the transformation of the local economy; or on the importance of the family in financing tourism projects; or on the deficiency of institutional capital."
"This dissertation addresses the question of how to enable decision-making to adopt Strategic Scanning (S.Scan). This work was motivated by an institutional request, reoriented by the findings from our exploratory study and supported by literature lack. This document follows a multi-paper model in which each connected study contributes to answer our main research inquiry. Our first study, Chapter 2, allowed us to understand that institutional pressures have an influence into the mental adoption of S.Scan. Chapter 3 and 4 focus into trial and allow the improvement of Target method aiding the identification of information needs for S.Scan. In addition, these improvements let to introduce two new concepts to S.Scan, helping practitioners identify their scan priorities. These studies are strongly linked, on one side, Chapter 3 contributes to identify the stakeholders and topics likely to represent information needs for managers in a particular context; on the other side, Chapter 4 combines the previous information with temporal considerations and a self-perceived anticipatory capacity within a meeting room system with the aim to facilitate S.Scan targeting and identifying scan priorities. In Chapter 5, we studied the interactions in collective targeting meetings in order to understand the contributions of such activities to develop organizational absorptive capacity. This work allowed the understanding of the main themes to be negotiated in order to ease the activity of targeting and to produce results, which represent the information needs of the organization as a whole. Finally, we present our: theoretical, research, and practice contributions."
"In France as in Switzerland, local authorities stand out as leading players of energy transition, a transition that requires an important renewal of public intervention instruments. It is the stakes and the conditions of such a renewal that the present work aims to examine, based on the experiments of territorial energy planning led on the franco-valdo-genevan cross-border territory. Conceived as initiatives of relocation of the energy supply system, these energy planning initiatives are examined through an institutionalist and pragmatic « reading template ».This « reading template » consists of seeing these energy planning initiatives as pragmatist inquiries aiming, through a collective work of cognitive equipment of the territorial franco-valdo-genevan field of intervention, at the reconstruction of the means of coordination between people about their material, organizational and political territory. It opens towards a double reading of the energy planning initiatives. The first one concentrates on the organizational dimension of these inquiries - i.e. on the cultures of action which they gather and the modalities of interaction between them - whereas the second focuses on the cognitive substance which represents the medium of the interactions.This double reading provides insights at various levels. The first one concerns the (cognitive) territorial field of intervention that these energy-planning experiments contribute to draw. A field which, although better and better characterized in its technical dimensions, remains at the same time limited and "" deformed "" so that it values more the fossil energy systems, from which we want to release ourselves, than the renewable ones, which we would like to replace them with.The second level of teaching concerns the processes of production of territorial knowledge (PPTK) which presides over the demarcation and « equipment » of the territorial field of intervention. Examined through the institutional norms and the culture of action at stake in them, this PPTK turns out to create a sociocognitive ""cross-border"" area, the kind of area that could shelter the desired reconfigurations…on the condition that they are beforehand correctly “equipped”, in cognitive and also in organizational terms.The determining factor for the quality of this equipment is concentrated in the third category of teaching. Starting with the opportunities created by these energy planning experiments concerning the renewal of public intervention instruments, these elements also allow us to take a new look at the urban area project under construction in this cross-border territory, a project that shows itself closely linked to the energy experiments through a common challenge of territorialisation."
"Much attention has been paid in recent years to the study of the underground economy in many developed and developing countries. The consequences and the policy implications linked with this ambiguous part of the economy have raised concerns among economists and governments that led to proposing various measures and estimation methods. It is not however easy to estimate accurately and precisely the size and trend of the underground economy due to its hidden nature. But, some techniques have been used by economists to directly and indirectly estimate the size of the underground economy.In this thesis, we have focused on the underground economy as a universal phenomenon having its unique and inescapable manifestation in the form of both legal and illegal activities. The main purpose of this thesis is to propose the fuzzy methods to measure the size and the amount of the underground economy.We first constructed a conceptual framework that allowed us to study the specifications of the underground economy. The common numerous estimation methods of the underground economy and their weaknesses and strengths were reviewed then. The basic conditions of applying the fuzzy concept and the initial conditions of the underground economy were investigated to see if they match. Since fuzzy modeling allows for rapid modeling even with imprecise and incomplete data and lets us to model non-linear functions of arbitrary complexity and achieve simplicity and flexibility, we were encouraged to apply fuzzy method.Two fuzzy methods were proposed to estimate the underground economy based on initial investigations during the period 1985-2010, including: the fuzzy modeling applying mean and standard deviation, the fuzzy modeling applying fuzzy clustering and Multiple Indicators and Multiple Causes (Structural Equation Modeling) with Fuzzy Data.Finally, the size of the underground economy was measured for France, Germany, Italy, USA and Canada and the results of these fuzzy methods were compared with other conventional methods. It can be claimed that the proposed methods in this work are qualitatively comparable to the common methods used to estimate the underground economy."
"The physical architecture of electricity grids and the organizational structure of power systems implemented after the reforms have traditionally be achieved according to the characteristics of the transmission infrastructures and power mixes. However, the new challenges related to energy transition favor a greater participation of decentralized generation and final consumers to system exploitation and competitive markets. This latter participation is made possible thanks to recent innovations in the fields of communication and remote control technologies.Significant evolutions are expected in power industries that share common characteristics. First, these evolutions suppose massive capital investments to modernize and adapt current power distribution grids. Second, it is expected the activation of distribution grids and final consumers will unleash substantial unexploited economic efficiency gains as well as impose new constraints.Taking these simple facts as a starting point, the objective of the thesis is twofold. In the first place, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regulatory instruments that monitor the system operators' expenses. Relying on the literature, we aim at characterizing what regulatory tools and incitation are suitable for investing in smart grids technologies. Since it is necessary to compare theoretical formulation to facts, we use an empirical approach that allows us to designate key benefits pursued by the development of smart grids and to compare our theoretical results with practical regulatory applications. Our findings eventually allow us to formulate recommendations.In the second place, the thesis focuses on the impacts of demand-side management during peak periods. We structure our approach around two general observations. Large benefits should be generated in lowering substantially peak demand. However, such situation also creates losses of profit for generators. We provide an estimation of efficiency gains and revenue losses induced by peak shedding. To this end, we develop and use a linear optimization model and expand our analysis to interconnected countries endowed with differentiated generation means.The thesis shows dominant regulatory frameworks are unsuited to provide the necessary sets of incentive to efficiently develop smart technologies. This can cause delays in their integration to power grids. The quantitative evaluation of the impacts generated by demand-side management shows significant efficiency gains are achievable through final consumers' flexibility. However, such measures create new discrepancies regarding installed capacities profitability, future capacity adequacy, and highlight potential antagonism between missing money for flexible peak capacities and the development of low carbon energies.It is clear the issues raised by the development of smart grids call for informed public debate as power industries are essential to our societies. Among the considerable amount of elements to discuss, issues relative to financing the investment projects and the inclusion of the new sources of flexibility induced by the technology in competitive markets will be of priority."
"The worrying situation of the international economy in the last years clearly shows the necessity to  rethink the international economic regulation. This PHD thesis focuses on the study of the International Monetary System (IMS) and claims that it is a destabilizing factor. The research has a two-fold purpose. First, it shows that the use of national money at an international level creates tensions that can ultimately lead to economic crisis. Once this assertion is verified, some proposals are made for a structural reform of the IMS.For this double aim, a heterogeneous theoretical approach is built in order to detect inherent tensions of the IMS in different historical contexts. On that basis, the thesis argues that while international economic relations develop, the IMS creates inherent tensions that make it difficult to grant a stable management of international liquidity.In the light of this, two analysis are developed in this research.  First, it is shown how inherent tensions have repeatedly appeared in the international economy since the generalization of the “key-currency” system. Second, the research explains the different national strategies pursued both for the integration in the IMS and for relieving  the observed tensions.  Recent tensions in the United States and in the Eurozone are studied carefully. From the study of these cases one main conclusion is made about the instability of the IMS, which is that crisis occurs due to destabilizing dynamics in a liberalized financial system and from accumulated tensions inside and among monetary zones.Finally, in order to correct the failures observed in the international monetary architecture, some structural reforms are proposed, both in the financial field and in the monetary one."
"The professional environment of French academics is moving. Indeed, reforms implemented in the French public higher education system since the 2000's have been numerous. Three main reforms are taken into account in our work. The first reform centers on organizations and is called LRU (Law n° 2007-1199 - 10th of August 2007 relative to liberty and responsibility of universities). The second reform impacts the evolution of the academics' status (Statutory order n° 2009-460 - 23th of April 2009). The third reform concerns the research evaluation process (Law of program for research n° 2006-450 - 18th of April 2006). The system underwent transformations touching universities: its autonomy was widened; and academics: the possible paths of career were modified; individual and collective practices: the accountability was strengthened. As we met a lot of academics who seemed disrupted by the evolution of the context in which their career took place, we decided to try to understand what happening. It is consequently to the influence of the professional environment on the career pathways of individuals that we dedicate our Phd work. More precisely, we analyze if this environment influences the behavior of academics in terms of careers, and if yes how does this influence play. To do so, we study the behavior regarding mobility, three types of mobilities being studied: the functional mobility (Evolution of the contents of the professional tasks and the basket of activity), the vertical mobility (Promotion) and the geographical mobility (national and international). The thesis that we defend through our work is: The professional environment is a provider of rules and standards sufficiently stringent to influence the career paths of French academics through isomorphism mechanisms that we highlight, whether coercive, normative and mimetic. However, the presence of contradictions and / or ambiguities in rules offer individuals the opportunity to interpret them and gives them the freedom to follow them or not. It is the position of individuals, whether they aim at conforming to the professional environment or rather in search of fun that will decide the path of career. Finally, we support the idea that reforms have come to upset the priorities of academics that can create a break in their career paths."
"This dissertation includes two studies. The first study analyzes the impact of auditor quality and audit regulation on the quality of accounting information, particularly on tradeoff between accrual-based and activity-based earnings management. In the second study in order to better understand the audit fees incurred by listed European companies we analysis the impact of audit regulation on the level of audit fees.Our representative sample is 4219 firms listed on European capital markets from 15 European countries over the period 2007 to 2010. Based on our sample, in the first study we analyze the respective impacts of both auditor quality and audit regulation on earnings quality. We capture auditor quality through using both audit firm size and audit firm industry specialization. We analyze five attributes of audit regulation including namely duration of audit tenure, restrictions on provision of non-audit services, nature of the auditors’ liability, constraints on audit partners’ rotation and obligation of a joint audit.Our main results are as follows: A) Only income-increasing earnings management, which is resulted in overstated earnings, is affected by auditor quality or audit regulations. B) Audit firm expertise influences negatively on the level of the both accrual-based earnings management and activity-based earnings management. Audits provided by large audit firms (i.e. Big4 auditors), have no impact on both accrual-based and activity-based earnings management. C) Audit firm expertise is not the only factor that affects audit quality and earnings quality. Regulation that governs audit services plays a major role in earnings quality as well. Two regulatory attributes have significant beneficial impact on accrual-based earnings management: the nature of the auditor’s liability and the minimal duration of the audit mandate. D) There is a substitution effect between accrual-based and activity-based earnings management, regarding the two attributes of audit regulation that are effective in curbing discretionary accruals. Because of regulatory constraints, the firms that cannot manage accruals upward apply more real activity management, and consequently their earnings are left affected by management actions.In 14 European countries, the diversity of regulations that govern statutory audits provides us with the opportunity to analyze how audit regulation affects audit fees. Using a sample of 4293 European firms over the period 2003 to 2011, in the second study we analyze the attributes of audit regulation, namely duration of audit tenure, restrictions on provision of non-audit services and nature of the auditors’ liability joint audit. Based on Our main results, in addition to usual determinants of audit fees (auditor reputation, firm size, leverage, audit risk…), the three attributes under study impact audit fees significantly. Fees are lower when regulation allows long audit tenure, or non-audit services, as well as when the auditor’s liability is based on tort law."

We capture auditor quality through using both audit firm size and audit firm industry specialization. We analyze five attributes of audit regulation including namely duration of audit tenure, restrictions on provision of non-audit services, nature of the auditors’ liability, constraints on audit partners’ rotation and obligation of a joint audit.Our main results are as follows: A) Only income-increasing earnings management, which is resulted in overstated earnings, is affected by auditor quality or audit regulations. B) Audit firm expertise influences negatively on the level of the both accrual-based earnings management and activity-based earnings management. Audits provided by large audit firms (i.e. Big4 auditors), have no impact on both accrual-based and activity-based earnings management. C) Audit firm expertise is not the only factor that affects audit quality and earnings quality. Regulation that governs audit services plays a major role in earnings quality as well. Two regulatory attributes have significant beneficial impact on accrual-based earnings management: the nature of the auditor’s liability and the minimal duration of the audit mandate. D) There is a substitution effect between accrual-based and activity-based earnings management, regarding the two attributes of audit regulation that are effective in curbing discretionary accruals. Because of regulatory constraints, the firms that cannot manage accruals upward apply more real activity management, and consequently their earnings are left affected by management actions.In 14 European countries, the diversity of regulations that govern statutory audits provides us with the opportunity to analyze how audit regulation affects audit fees. Using a sample of 4293 European firms over the period 2003 to 2011, in the second study we analyze the attributes of audit regulation, namely duration of audit tenure, restrictions on provision of non-audit services and nature of the auditors’ liability joint audit. Based on Our main results, in addition to usual determinants of audit fees (auditor reputation, firm size, leverage, audit risk…), the three attributes under study impact audit fees significantly. Fees are lower when regulation allows long audit tenure, or non-audit services, as well as when the auditor’s liability is based on tort law."
"How can you transmit taste, or a gesture, or know-how? How can this be taught when the trainer doesn’t even share the same culture or the same codes as the learner? What might this experience add to the future career of those concerned?The aim of this thesis is to add new theoretical and empirical light to the transmission of gastronomic competences and knowledge within an intercultural context as well as to understand its impact on the future careers of chefs and maîtres d’hôtel.This research explores the elitist world of ‘Haute cuisine’, and more specifically the Restaurant-School Institut Paul Bocuse of Shanghai, drawing upon a longitudinal case study done between June 2013 and April 2014.Transferring know-how that combines tradition and innovation requires an understanding of the « spirit » of French gastronomy. Thus, the first article shows that to transmit know-how, practices and this spirit within an intercultural context it is vital to belong to a large and varied community that can guarantee fundamental authenticity. An element of Kant’s transcendental dimension, in which thought precedes existence, is a vital part of this process.The second article examines how interactions between the trainers and the Chinese students are managed during different modes of transmission of the gastronomy. Carlile‘s model (2004) is amended and developed in an intercultural context. At each level of transmission (transfer, translation, hybridisation) a dimension of inclusion and exclusion govern the hierarchical relationship between the intern-trainers and the learners.Finally, the third article explores the benefit of this internship for the careers of the future young chefs and maîtres d’hôtel. The development of the « Career Competences Model », championed by Defillippi & Arthur (1994) and subsequently, Akkermans et al. (2013), leads to the elaboration of a new, international, career competence. This research also reveals signs of an « anticipated boundaryless career » by the young chefs and maîtres d’hôtel.Transmitting a profession, know how, or gestures whilst striking the balance between innovation and tradition requires a common framework of tastes and values. Transcendence serves as the catalyst to such action. This transmission also requires that different modes of interaction be taken into account. These govern the daily relationships between the trainers and the learners especially given the intercultural context. Furthermore, this experience enables the acquisition of specific international competences and lays the foundations for a future boundaryless career."
"Recent research demonstrates that, in ethically relevant tasks, individuals base intentionality judgments on action outcomes, rather than mental states only. In a first place, the current thesis extends those findings to responsibility judgments and examines affective and attitudinal characteristics moderating the relationship between outcomes and moral judgment. At a second place, the current thesis discusses ethical organizational activity with a focus on intensified ethical behavior enacted following involvement in heavy unethical activity. In so doing, the current thesis intends to problematize the extent to which motivation behind such organizational attitudes is genuinely trying to compensate for the negative effects of organizational wrong-doing. At the same time, the current thesis examines human perception of the above mentioned organizational efforts to compensate for corporate malfeasance. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding ethical decision making and ethical judgments, offering theoretical directions for future research and managerial implications."
"Fifty years ago, the expression of industrial performance was Taylorian, mono criterion, and attached to the financial results of the company. Today, the performance has adopted both multi criteria and multilevel dimensions. More generally, such a performance is usually related to the achievement of overall objectives and is dedicated to control purposes, post Taylorian performances are thus expressed on the basis of comparisons between the fixed objectives and the corresponding measures. However, this performance is often statically expressed, generally at the final moment of the temporal horizon which is associated with the objective achievement.In this thesis, we propose a definition of the “temporal” performance, according to three performances: the instantaneous performance, the trend performance and the predictive performance. The fundamental assumption in our work consists of considering an objective as being a trajectory of what we call intermediate objectives, throughout a given temporal horizon. Instantaneous performance is expressed by the objective achievement at a given milestone of the temporal horizon. Such a performance relies on the comparison of the objective and the measurement of its achievement. Trend performance is the result of the comparison of the trend objective with the trend measurement. This performance provides information concerning the objective achievement. Predictive performance is defined at a given milestone of the temporal horizon, for a future milestone of this horizon. It is the result of the comparison of the intermediate objective of the considered future milestone with an estimation of measurement at this same future milestone. Moreover, a methodology for using these performances is proposed, based on a principle of aggregation, ""in pairs"", of the three temporal performances, which allows us to provide a single synthetic piece of information that is, to some extent, the performance of the objective trajectory. As a continuation of this definition step, we propose a qualitative formalization of these performances, based on the fuzzy subsets theory. Rules-based aggregations and linguistic descriptions are used in this. Finally, we illustrate these propositions with examples that are extracted from the OEE improvement project of the Fournier Company."
"The increase in movement of professional footballers from Africa to the European leagues as observed since the 1990’, has transformed the labour football migration. In return, this also impacted African footballers’ incomes, social status, and their relation to the communities of origin in terms of socio-economic support. This research focuses on this subject by drawing on the understanding of the evolution of African professional football, players migration itineraries, as to explain the ‘give back phenomenon’ (GBP) related to their relationship with the communities of origin. It examines the role of the economic and non-economic factors that orient African footballers’ ways of giving back to their families, relatives, and the communities. Their give back may be determined by the aim of return on investments, by the influence of communities’ values, norms, or by embeddedness in social networks or by the institutionalised networks related to footballers’ migration. In other words, the analysis of their giving back may be based on the combination of social, cultural and economic factors. Thus, this research mobilised multidisciplinary approach through the socio-economic theoretical model of analysis. Weber methodology helps to do so, in the analysis of footballers’ 'give back' action. This is generally considered as the players’ social contribution and their communities expect to receive something from financially successful professional African migrant players. The study’s qualitative survey was based on thirty-two interviews of professional players from Africa including, biographies and autobiographies. The results show that African migrant players’ behaviours in term of giving back depend on their justifications, which are based on economic interest, social or cultural logics.The research revealed three major outcomes:1) specific evolution of African football and communities’ perception of professional football. This identified one periodization, with three phases, showing families, football structures and migration strategies evolution: a) the controversial vision of football (the 1980s): football vs. school b) the shared vision of football (the 1990s): gradual shift from social activity to a professional activity, and c) football professionalism as an opportunity (the 2000s)		                                 2) three types of players’ migration itineraries which are linked to their strategies, networks mobilised, and the resources available to them: a) collective resource-based, b) formal networks-based, and c) individual resource-based.          						            3) typology of 'GBP' based on African migrant players’ socio-economic behaviours was a) hybrid family, b) cross-closed family, c) shared family, and d) shadow family that influenced their type of investments in the communities. On another hand, some projects of players tend to support regional and national development in the communities. However, African player migrants have to manage and protect the fame, and sporting resources by using them intelligently to do good things for their communities, friends and others beyond the continent. In conclusion, the itineraries of players’ show the role of the communities in their migration projects. On another hand, the evolution of African football displays how players’ strategies changed with the structuration of African football and the attractiveness of the European football market. The co-determining of economic and non-economic factors relating to the ‘GBP’, justify the use of economic sociology theories. This research demonstrates that ‘GBP’ is not only based on the players’ economic interest but also the combination of social, cultural and economic elements."
"The crisis of the Latin American external debt of the eighties meant the change of the model of industrialization by substitution of imports towards a model of sustained development in the liberalization of the economy. The transition was triggered by IMF macroeconomic adjustment and stabilization policies. These measures were continued, consolidated and deepened by the World Bank and International Development Cooperation, through structural reforms that brought about changes in the State and society. This generated social unrest that was expressed in mobilizations, claims and rejections in almost all countries in the region. These social mobilizations against neoliberal structural adjustment and reform gave rise to new political discourses. One of them is the Good Living (Buen Vivir), that was incorporated into the Political Constitution of Ecuador and Bolivia in 2008. Buen Vivir collects the demands for a model of friendly, supportive development, friendly to nature and in which the fundamental rights of human beings, including the right to radical difference, are respected. The discourse of Good Living reflects the criticisms of development made by post-development and decline, and integrates them into a new dimension, which refers to otherness in the economy."
"This thesis investigates the impact of public subsidies for innovation on firms’ export activity. Previous research has focused mainly on understanding the effects of innovation support on investment in R&D (additional effect). While R&D investment is logically the primary indicator of innovation aid effectiveness, this approach ignores potential impact on strategy, particularly on export. Our research framework draws on two distinct streams of literature that have not been mobilized so far. First, the literature which evaluates the impact of aid shows that these devices can induce strategic R&D decisions in firms. Secondly, the work of Constantini and Melitz (2007) and Aw, Roberts and Xu, (2008) emphasizes the interdependence between firms' innovation and export decisions. Particular attention is paid in this study on the effect of innovation tax credits. The empirical methodology utilizes two econometric methods, bi-varied recursive and propensity score matching, generating three main results:First, (1) innovation support impacts the causal relationship between product innovation and export in the short term. This result is also observed when the analysis focuses on the effect of tax incentives. Then, (2) innovation subsidies impact the export activity of firms directly and simultaneously This effect occurs for firms that have benefited only from tax incentives. However, benefiting from both direct and tax subsidies for innovation does not affect? joint decisions regarding innovation and export. Finally, (3) considering the central role of R&D investments reveals that the impact of innovation subsidies on exports is an extension of the effectiveness of innovation policies. These results lead to several policy recommendations that can be used to improve public support effectiveness for both innovation and export activities."
"Lately, interests in industrial policy have made a remarkable comeback in an international environment that holds serious challenges as the integration into the wold economy that took the form of trade, investment, and financial liberalization, in last three decades, has reduced de facto and de jure industrial policy space.The thesis provides a qualitative and a comparative assessment of constraints on the use of industrial policy instruments in the context of the rising regionalism. It reviews 36 North-South and South-South regional trade agreements: 10 Agreements of the United States, 12 Agreements of European Union, 6 Chinese Agreements and 8 Indian Agreements, all with developing countries. It maps commitments that affect industrial policy instruments in three interrelated areas: foreign investment regulation, patent, and standardization. It compares the agreements’ engagements against WTO obligations and each other.Results show that North-South modes of regulation of investment and trade relations go systematically beyond WTO Agreements commitments, narrowing and eliminating its “flexibilities”. As a result, de jure industrial policy space of partner countries shrinks to a historically low level. In turn, the South-South modes of regulation of trade and investment relations preserve WTO “flexibilities” to a large extent, as result of (i) explicit affirmation of these flexibilities, and (ii) the non-inclusion of substantial commitments going beyond WTO agreements.Contrary to the agreements of the United States and the European Union, the de jure possibility to use industrial policy instruments is substantially preserved under the agreements of China and India with respect to: (i) measures aimed at regulating foreign investments in a manner that permits to trigger its industrial development benefits and to avoid its associated risks, (ii) the design of national patent system in manner that facilitates the access to and diffusion of technologies and knowledge, and (iii) the use of standards and technical regulations as instruments to overcome investment coordination failure, and as tools of control mechanism that should be associated with the State’s distributed rent to local producers."
"Despite the appearance of competition between currencies, the US dollar remains the invoicing currency among the actors of international trade. Such observation is derived from ample statistical evidence contained in this thesis. This observation represents the starting-point of a broader reflection on the rationale underlying the choice of an invoicing currency in international trade, which is the central question which this thesis aims to address. Various determinants have been closely examined by the academic literature to that end. Three approaches dealt with the subject, each with its distinct methodology, and can therefore be analyzed comparatively: the standard macroeconomic approach, the institutionalist approach, and the international political economy approach. The main result of this thesis is that preference for the US dollar cannot be explained exclusively by the instrumental approaches of money which usually prevail in international macroeconomics: their contributions are useful but inadequate as they envision money primarily as a tool for maximizing individual utilities. By applying the institutionalist reading to international exchanges, the thesis introduces the necessity of trust and ethical appeal that money inspires, and the centrality of the social order that its regulatory institutions pursue. This necessity was reasserted throughout the twentieth century, as competing currencies failed to challenge the supremacy of the dollar. It is also evidenced by the resilience of the American currency itself."
"An increasing number of OECD countries has adopted measures to encourage the use of public procurement to foster innovation. However, implementation of public procurement of innovation (PPI) is lagging behind policy discourse. The ambition of this dissertation is to address this discrepancy by assisting in the design of PPI initiatives, that is, by identifying the innovation-related failures that PPI can overcome, and the most appropriate policy instruments and practices for achieving this objective. We define eight PPI ideal-types according to the type of meso-level market of system failures they address. These failures can relate to users, producers or to their mutual interactions. We confront them with macro-level failures, and determine accordingly the contribution of each PPI ideal-type to distinct mission-oriented policies. Our typology provides a unified PPI framework associating their rationales with their design. Therefore, it contributes to policymaking, and to policy evaluation and analysis. Some PPI categories aim to spur innovation by stimulating the formation of markets. We employ an evolutionary approach to analyse the influence of PPI at the different stages of the dynamic process of market formation through a series of selected existing case studies. We demonstrate that PPI can underpin the different phases of knowledge coordination for market formation, by ensuring appropriate interactions between users and producers early in the public procurement procedure. The literature on private procurement nevertheless shows that early supplier involvement is subject to a number of micro-level failures having their root in procurement practices. Based on interviews with public procurers and suppliers, we identify relevant collaboration failures related to the standard PPI and competitive dialogue procedures. We highlight differences in these failures and their loci between the two procedures. Furthermore, public procurers and suppliers appear to have different perception of the causes of the failures they have encountered. Finally, our findings discuss the influence of the legal framework on PPI and suggest additional PPI procedures and strategies that are favoured by suppliers to varying extents. In sum, our research identifies innovation-related failures at different levels that PPI can resolve, and relevant instruments to help PPI initiative to achieve their objectives. Furthermore, it advocates a dynamic approach considering failures, instruments, and practices at different stages of public procurement procedures, and market formation and public procurer-supplier collaboration processes."

"This PhD thesis addresses the issue of the transformation of interventions destined to prevent psychosocial risks into more durable organisational changes that would increase the health and well-being of employees, analysed through the lens of the theories of self-determination and of sensemaking. This research consists in a qualitative case study of different public organisations in which such interventions have been conducted, and in the quantitative analysis of 1373 surveys collected in one public organisation. The results of this research highlight the importance of sensemaking, of autonomous motivation and satisfaction of the three fundamental needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence as major variables for the success of interventions for the prevention of psychosocial risks. Furthermore, helping their employees to fulfil their needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence is also linked to an increase in their well-being. This research introduces a new theoretical frame that can both benefit the academic field of human resources management and organisational practices."
"Assessing Corporate Social Responsability (CSR) implies to investigateempirically the operations implemented and, at the territorial level, to characterizetheir structural impacts beyond the effects initially targeted. Our research carriesout such an assessment for the banana sector in Cameroon. It draws onmethodological tools that Elinor Ostrom has set up by studying commons, thenadjusted to a context of systemic corruption. As a result, we show : how conflictson a key resource use and appropriation (land) have arised in history and areframed by specific sets of rules in use ; to what extent the CSR operations wehave assessed (Fairtrade labels, health and education aid…) result in materialimprovements for workers and neighbouring communities while reducing theircapabilities to face environmental and social issues generated by the banana agroindustry.Then we explain why the way firms’ governements steers structuralchanges in the social group addressed by their CSR operations can qualify for‘neopaternalism’ and ‘managerial governmentality’."
"In order to face the increased market competition, SMEs are joining collaborative innovation networks (CINs). In fact, these sturcutres enable them access to complementary knowledge that is necessary to conduct their innovation projects. The contribution of an SME to such a network requires an absorption of the knowledge brought by the other participants and eventually of knowledge external to the constituted network.The aim of this thesis is to develop a maturity tool to assess the absorptive capacity of SMEs operating in such contexts. This evaluation will help them contribute effectively to the project and foster the innovation success of this latter. It will also guide them towards the best practices to capitalize on their experiences within these networks and hence improve the performance of their own organizationsA mixed method has been adopted for the development of this tool. A first qualitative phase enabled the identification of absorption practices for an SME embedded in a CIN. This phase is mainly composed of an in-depth literature review, 20 semi-directive interviews with 13 SMEs in the Rhône-Alpes region of France and the Yorkshire region in the UK and two working sessions with expert researchers and practitioners. A second quantitative phase aimed at evaluating the relevance of these practices for each possible situation of an SME's participation in a CIN. To this end, a survey questionnaire was first tested with 2 practitioners and 2 researchers and then administered to a sample of SMEs who had operated in similar contexts. The collected data was analyzed according to a PLS-SEM approach and enabled formulating a prediction equation for each absorption practice, according to the context of the SME's participation within the network. The practices resulting from the qualitative phase combined with the formulas steming from the quantitative one were then operationalized through a maturity grid. The latter will be iteratively improved through successive applications with SMEs embedded in CINs.This thesis implies contributions at several levels. From a theoretical point of view, it confirms the prominence for innovation of the concept of absorptive capacity, through its characterization for the context of an SME embedded in a CIN. From a practical point of view, the implementation of this characterization through a tool for the use of SMEs helps them foster the success of their experiences within such networks. Finally, from a methodological point of view, the adoption of a quantitative approach to contextualize a maturity grid is a novel methodology in the development stream of such performance improvement tools."
"In the context of Industry 4.0 and the More than Moore’s paradigm, delivery precision and short cycle times are essential to the competitiveness of High Mix Low Volume semiconductor manufacturing and future industries in general. So called “variability” however creates uncontrolled and unpredictable “traffic-jams” in manufacturing systems, increasing cycle times and decreasing the systems’ tractability. This research, a CIFRE PhD between the GSCOP laboratory and STMicroelectronics, addresses this issue of variability in complex manufacturing environment. We first conducted, in the first part of the manuscript, an in-depth study of “variability”: we approached the notion through its consequences in manufacturing systems, clarified that the variability was about the workflow, introducing the notion of workflow variability and measures that come with it, and identified the main sources of variability through a literature review and real-world examples. We focused in the second part of this manuscript on the integration of workflow variability in production management tools: We showed how integrating the stable consequences of workflow variability can improve WIP projections in complex systems and increase the control on such systems, proposed a new tool (the Concurrent WIP) to better measure the performances of systems subject to high workflow variability, and showed that complex “dependency” mechanisms play a key role in workflow variability yet are not integrated in any model. Finally, the third and last part of the manuscript organized perspectives for variability reduction: based on the work of this manuscript, we showed a framework for variability reduction on the short term, and proposed a direction for medium and long-term research."
"ERP systems have been widely studied during the past decades, yet they often fail to deliver the intended benefits originally expected. One notable reason is the lack of understanding how the customization influence the ERP user acceptance when there is lack of system-to-business fit, which can lead to negative business outcomes. For some reasons, many have argued that a ""vanilla"" implementation, i.e. without customization, is the ""best"" way to implement ERP systems. However, through quantitative research based on web survey, this dissertation revealed that, in China, customization is a must in ERP acceptance and project success. Because of the various risks in ERP project, financial, technical, functional and political, vendors and consultants are keen on helping the project manager to meet the budget and time target rather than to reap more benefit for business performance. Thus, customization usually had been avoided, and insufficient customization are more common than over customization. We proposed 15 hypothesis and 11 were supported, and the general conclusion that, customization level has significant positive influence on behavioral intention, the higher customization done, the higher behavioral intention (BI) to use the system. It is an instruction for companies that, right level of customization (CL) should be achieved instead of avoiding customization. And only higher strategic important customization should be included in the project when there is limitation in budget and time. We also confirmed that ease of customization is an important factor in selecting the right ERP solution. As a moderator, different role have different perception on customization, normal users have stronger expectancy in customization, so it is critical to explain to the users, which customization is strategic, and which one is for consistency purpose and could jeopardize the real benefit of ERP system. If it is not appropriate to do the customization in the project implementation phase, a plan for future system customization should be prepared and it will ultimately improve the system long term success."
"The French « Revenu de Solidarité Active » (RSA) generated a great deal of interest in the the scientific community, focused mainly on its impact on labor force participation and on working poor. In this context, the thesis looks for a critical assessment of the device: we show its inability to take over the contradictory position in which the beneficiaries are placed. Those are confronted with structurally difficult conditions for the exploitation of the labor force, and at the same time the RSA organizes, through various means, the centrality of employment. Firstly, the thesis discusses the categories of work, constructed by the critical Marxism of Moishe Postone and by Hannah Arendt. Thanks to this theoretical approach, we understand that the RSA redefines the beneficiaries' labour statuses, around a staging of the need for a return to work. Simultaneously, we show theoretically and empirically the contradictory position of work in contemporary capitalism: source of social wealth, certainly, but also undermined by increasingly difficult conditions for the exploitation of labor power. Secondly, we implement a follow-up of a cohort of beneficiary households in the department of Isère, between 2010 and 2012. Descriptive statistical analysis and the modeling of mobilities and trajectories lead us to show diversity of individual paths. In addition to the temporary uses of RSA, which constitute a majority, we note paths are broken, and when they show stability, it is often in labor market's margins. Finally, we show that the RSA fails to gather, behind employment as an uniform standard, the great diversity of beneficiaries."
"To preserve its stability and ensure a strong market position, an organization should be able to anticipate upcoming changes. The concept of scanning the environment for valuable information and indicative signals that allow an organization to predict a potential future event is termed “strategic scanning”.Strategic scanning is still considered a hard task to put in place. One of the reasons to explain this difficulty is the absence of a supporting tool which is also identified as a factor that can lead to the failure of the implementation and sustainability of strategic scanning.The development of social networks sites (SNS) proved to be extremely popular in the personal sphere, and started raising interest in the scientific community as well as in organizations.Growing awareness of the added value of SNS in organizations lead to the creation of numerous corporate social networks (CSN) technology that has transformed the way employees work and interact.On one hand, strategic scanning still lacks an “information management supporting tool”. On the other hand, CSN technology are widely spread ways to communicate, collaborate and share information. This makes CSN technology a potential candidate to support strategic scanning.The aim of our study is to investigate the adoption of CSN technology as a supporting IS for strategic process. To do so we ask 3 sub-questions:1-what is the fit between CSN technology and strategic scanning process?To answer this, we construct a theoretical framework by addressing the functionalities required to support a strategic scanning process, and addressing the functionalities offered by CSN technology.Our results show the existence of both a potential fit and misfit between CSN functionalities and strategic scanning process.Based on this observation, we attempt to study the reasons behind the adoption of CSN technology to support strategic scanning process.Hence, we address the determinants of CSN technology adoption in two different contexts of use -which is the aim of the two following sub-question.2-what are the determinants of CSN technology adoption (independently of its managerial context of use)?Adoption is the process of developing, implementing and having the will to make full use of the technology.Despite numerous studies attempting to understand technology adoption, existing theories and most of the models lack a holistic view and reflect a fragmented image.Thus, to answer the second sub-question, we draw a theoretical framework that consists of determinants of technology adoption and determinants of SNS and CSN technology adoption identified in the literature.Based on this theoretical framework, we identify 15 determinants that might influence the adoption of CSN technology independently of its managerial context of use.3-what are the determinants of CSN technology adoption to support strategic scanning process?To answer this, we split the list of 15 determinants previously identified into 2 groups: 1) determinants of CSN technology adoption to support strategic scanning process and 2) determinants of CSN technology adoption to support other business processes.Comparing these 2 groups allow us to identify determinants of CSN adoption to support strategic scanning process that do not emerge when addressing the adoption of CSN to support other business processes.We identified 15 determinants that might influence the adoption of CSN technology to support strategic scanning process. Importantly, among these determinants, only 5 determinants are reported in the case of CSN technology adoption to support strategic scanning process.Based on all the above, our work reveals that CSN technology can be a supporting tool for strategic scanning process in some contexts. Further, our study allows us to propose recommendations that might help organizations to adopt CSN technology as a supporting tool for strategic scanning process."
"This thesis contributes to the understanding of an emergent and complex phenomenon: transformation/smartization of the urban public service system. This involves innovative, context-sensitive and interoperable public service systems, as well as the cross combination of different services sectors such as transport, tourism, taxes, etc. We define three pillars of service science : Service System (SS), Service Innovation (IS) and Institutional Service Logic (LIS) in order to develop a process and content research to understand the dynamics of urban public service system institutional and structural transformation. We propose a method based on Latent SemanticAnalysis (LSA), Factor Analysis (FA), text mining and grounded theory to inductively reveal 30 years of evolution of interdisciplinarySS, IS and LIS intellectual structure from 1986 to 2015. In particular, we analyze the process of institutional work between antagonisticand complementary collective logics. Then, we mobilize complex thinking as an integrating framework of components of the urban publicservice system that becomes smart, as a whole and its parts. Our research design is based on grounded theory ; observations, longitudinalcase study with a multi-level approach (i.e. local and national) ; the dialogic model(Parmentier-Cajaiba & Avenier, 2013) and the pragmaticconstructivism epistemological paradigm (PECP). We define two working ontological hypotheses : the relational ontology and becomingontology. From the theoretical point of view, our research contributes to the theoretical refinement of the literature on SS, IS and LIS. Wepropose three heuristic models from a process and content analysis (Baines et al. 2017) and grounded theory (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991 ;Gioia et al., 2013). The first heuristic model contributes to the understanding of the institutional work process for the creation of institutionalarrangements (Standard, boundary resources, APIs) between two antagonistic and complementary collective logics (Morin, 2005 ; Smets & Jarzabkowski, 2013 ; Greenwood et al., 2017) : the service-dominant logic of the market (Lusch & Nambisan, 2015 ; Vargo & Lusch, 2016)and the public service logic (Osborne et al., 2015 ; Osborne, 2017). The second heuristic model highlights components of a smart publicservice system. The third heuristic model highlights the drivers and barriers of institutional and structural transformation."
"The understanding of Vietnamese consumer behaviors toward brands is crucial for not only local but also foreign marketers to be prepared for the competition in the Vietnamese market. In addition, marketers are increasingly trying to build and to understand the relationship between their brands and consumers. So, this research focuses on a causal model of some antecedents and consequences of hot and cold brand relationship quality (BRQ) dimensions: an empirical test in a Vietnamese context. The investigation is based on the theories of brand personality, antecedents (self-congruence and partner quality), consequences (WTP, consideration set size, and WOM), hot and cold BRQ, and brand purchase intention.The aim behind of this research can be summed up in the following objective: firstly, to determine the effects of brand personality on antecedents of two components of BRQ in the context of Vietnam; secondly, to investigate the impacts of antecedents and consequences of two components of BRQ on brand purchase intention in the context of Vietnam. A structure model was developed illustrating the relationships (assumed) between brand personality on antecedents and consequences of brand relationship quality (BRQ). This resulted in the developed of twenty hypotheses. To address the research aims, data were collected which focused on six product classes and 634 questionnaires were collected in final. Regarding the current of theoretical development, PLS path modeling was used to analyze the data.The key findings emerged from the findings of the current research, which supports our expectation. First, the results of our findings reveal that brand personality has a positive influence on two variables self-congruence and partner quality, but it is clearly seen that there is a different level of influence and importance. Secondly, given that self-congruence is a more significant effect on hot than cold BRQ, on the other hand, partner quality is a more significant effect on cold than hot BRQ. However, based on the path coefficient of self-congruence and partner quality, the results reveal that self-congruence has a positive significant effect on both hot and cold BRQ compared to partner quality. Next, to see how the effects of hot and cold BRQ on the consequences of its, the findings reveal that hot and cold BRQ have positive on consequences with WTP, consideration set size, WOM, which are supported to our proposal hypotheses. Regarding the results of consequences of two components of BRQ on brand purchase intention. We found that consideration set size and WOM have no relationship with brand purchase intention, while WTP has a positive significant effect on brand purchase intention.The key contributions of this research provide a better understanding consumer behavior in the Vietnamese market. The findings of our study show that hot BRQ has been shown to have a stronger and significant influence on consumer’s WTP. Cold BRQ, however, was found to strongly impact the consumer’s WOM. Therefore, hot BRQ, which is the emotional relationship quality, mainly increases the loyalty behavior of customers; in contrast, cold BRQ helps to attract new customers by positively word-of-mouth communication of customers. Both the retention of current customers and the attraction of news customers are crucial drivers for the sustainable future of a brand or a product. Managers need, therefore, try to positively impact both hot and cold BRQ of their customers. Furthermore, based on the research results, they should focus on a willingness to pay price premium in order to increase their brand purchasing intention."
"The tool conceptualized and developed during this thesis aims to: (1) Take advantage of recent evolutions of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by proposing new approaches for the treatment of problems having a spatial aspect. (2) Apply theorical approach in real industrial issues to propose approaches for phases that are not addressed in theoretical research. With this in mind, three modules have been developed, a spatial data integration and visualization module, a data pre-processing module and a coverage optimization module.- The first part of the thesis addresses the subject of the implementation of the first module, and proposes a conceptual framework for the development of similar tools. The integration and visualization module allows access to sales data via a dedicated web interface. The platform allows the contextualization of sales data by displaying retailers on a map and giving access to the visualization of other data (eg socio-demographic, competitive). The retailers displayed on the map can be filtered according to their characteristics and colorable according to multiple criteria (eg comparison with previous years, comparison with objectives, etc.). The selection of the elements present on the map allows to have access to their detailed information. All the different functionalities allow for a better understanding of the market, and allow for the exploration of the sales results in a new angle.- The second part deals with the spatial data pre-processing tool. Our approach makes it possible to make spatial data analysis available to users who do not have GIS knowledge. In addition to this, the realization of the pre-processing steps can be carried out more quickly, and with guided choices for the selection of the spatial relations to take into account. A functional implementation of the approach has been implemented, based on open source tools to enable cost-effective implementation of our solution. The use of our implementation allows for significant time savings when pre-processing spatial data for geospatial data analysis.- The third and final part focuses on the coverage optimization module that is based on the structure and modules previously implemented. It takes as input the datasets corresponding to the potentials of the zones and those corresponding to the distributors and their catchment areas. From this data, the module proposes solutions to improve the coverage that take into account the aspects related to the catchment area of ​​each distributors and the collaborative capture of the potential."
"Along with the price, the delivery lead time has become a key factor of competitiveness for companies and an important purchase criterion for many customers. Nowadays, firms are more than ever obliged to meet their quoted lead time, which is the delivery lead time announced to the customers. The combination of pricing and lead time quotation implies new trade-offs and offers opportunities for many insights. For instance, on the one hand, a shorter quoted lead time can lead to an increase in the demand but also increases the risk of late delivery and thus may affect the firm’s reputation and deter future customers. On the other hand, a longer quoted lead time or a higher price generally yields a lower demand. Despite the strategic role of joint pricing and lead time quotation decisions and their impacts on demand, in the operations management literature an exogenous demand (a priory a known demand) is generally used in supply chain models, even if the design of the supply chain has a strong impact on lead times (i.e., sites location, inventory position, etc.) and thus affects the demand. Therefore, we are interested in the lead time quotation and pricing decisions in a context of endogenous demand (i.e., demand sensitive to price and quoted lead time).The literature dealing with pricing and lead time quotation under an endogenous demand mainly considered a make to order (MTO) context. A pioneer paper, Palaka et al. (1998), investigated this issue by modeling the company as an M/M/1 queue, and our work follows their footsteps. Our review of the literature allowed to identify new perspectives for this problem, which led to three main contributions in this thesis.In our first contribution, using Palaka et al.’s framework, we consider the unit production cost to be a decreasing function in quoted lead time. In most published papers, the unit production cost was assumed to be constant. In practice, the unit production cost generally depends on the quoted lead time. Indeed, the firm can manage better the production process and reduce the production cost by quoting longer lead time to the customers.In the second contribution, we still consider Palaka et al.’s framework but model the firm as an M/M/1/K queue, for which demand is rejected if there are already K customers in the system. In the literature on single firm setting following Palaka et al.’s research, only the M/M/1 queue was used, i.e., where all customers are accepted, which might lead to long sojourn times in the system. Our idea is based on the fact that rejecting some customers,  might help to quote shorter lead time for the accepted ones, which might finally lead to a higher profitability, even if in the first glance we lose some demand.In the third contribution, we study a new framework for the lead time quotation and pricing problem under endogenous demand as we model the supply chain by two production stages in a tandem queue (M/M/1-M/M/1). In the literature with multi-firm setting, all papers considered that only one actor has production operations and the other actor has zero lead time. We investigated both the centralized and decentralized decision settings.For each problem studied, we formulated a profit-maximization model, where the profit consists of a revenue minus the production, storage and lateness penalty costs, and provides the optimum result (analytically or numerically). These resolutions led us to demonstrate new theoretical results (such as the expected lateness in an M/M/1/K, and the sufficient condition required to satisfy the global service constraint in a tandem queue by only satisfying the local service constraints). We also conducted numerical experiments and derived managerial insights."
"The order picking is a critical activity in distribution warehouses (60% of the operational costs in traditional warehouses). One way to reduce these costs is to collect several orders simultaneously, rather than individually, to avoid unnecessary travels to the operators in the case of manual picking of the products, and less workload for the machines, in the case of automated picking. We consider, in this PhD, warehouses where products are stored in automated storage systems composed by trays on which products are stored. We consider two types of machines: VLMs and Carousels. These two types differ by the time required to move from a tray to the next one to visit (constant in the case of a VLM, depending on the number of trays between 2 consecutively visited trays for the carousels). We aim to develop order batching methods in automated warehouses to collect a set of orders efficiently, according to criteria that we will define.We study a first category of order batching, for which each batch will be entirely collected (all orders associated with a given batch will be collected) before moving to the next batch. We evaluate completion time, when the operator does the picking on one or several machines. The interest of using multiple machines is to search trays in masked time (the machine change trays while the operator is busy to collect on other machines). From this evaluation of the completion time, we extract an optimization criterion and establish optimization models for the VLMs then the carousels. These models are then tested with actual data, thanks to the partnership with the company KLS Logistic, editor of the WMS Gildas. Finally, we extend the resolution to metaheuristics, to ensure good solutions under reasonable computation time. Significant savings in terms of completion time reduction justifies the interest of our work.We then study the second category, where a set of orders is collected simultaneously, but unlike the previous case, whenever an order is collected, it is immediately replaced by a new one. We'll talk here about ""Rolling batching”. This approach is typically used in the ""Drive-in shops"". We develop an algorithm for the computation of the waiting time of the operator. Resolution coupling heuristics and a metaheuristic is proposed in order to effectively resolve the order sequencing. Significant gains are achieved by the use of the proposed method."
"Our research focuses on the cooperation and climate governance in the post-Copenhagen era. Its main purpose is to observe and define the evolution of the climate regime, based on the positions of the European Union, China and the United States. These three countries can be considered as big emitters, major economies, as well as great powers. Two main drivers are taken into account in our analysis: mitigation and adaptation costs to climate change. The starting point for our research is to be found in the polarized evolution of the climate regime. The most illustrative aspect of this “metamorphosis” is the shift, in 2009, from the top-down to the bottom-up architecture of the climate regime.Thus, we resort to a hybrid theoretical background, which consists of both international political economy and climate change economy. The joint contribution of the two approaches allows us to analyze international political economy with climate economy as an input, as well as the impact of international relations on the main economic framework of climate change. Our research is based on a specific cooperation model, known as the “k-group” theory, as developed by Duncan Snidal (1985).Within this framework of minilateral cooperation, the thesis that we defend is that it is possible to have a climate k-group which may have a trigger effect in order to obtain an ambitious regime. The starting point for our argument is that this group can be considered as a “club of the relevant”, and that what it needs to achieve in order to constitute a k-group is to establish a “coalition of the willing”. The capacity and the willingness to act are mainly influenced by the costs they have to bear, that is the costs to mitigate their emissions and to adapt to the climate change consequences. Meanwhile, the group's collective commitment depends on other countries' actions. More precisely, the incentive mechanism is built on the idea that cooperation is meant to widen, in order to eventually prevent free riding.Our main results are to be regarded in the light of the COP 21 outcome. If the k-group works, it is because our three countries decide to move forward and accept to bear mitigation costs that are higher than those of other countries'. Their collective commitment should trigger a virtuous dynamic which would impose on climate regime a collective leadership of these three countries, thus leaving the others with no other way than to follow. If the k-group does not work, it is because our three actors consider upfront costs too high with respect to their own interests, as well as to the risk of free riding (if the others do not go along). Given our three actors' economic and political context, this scenario seems likely.Finally, we rather favor in our work the Europe-China tandem. We argue that the k-group should be built on this joint cooperation, since, unlike the United States, Europe appears to be more willing to endorse an ambitious regime, whereas China seems an unavoidable actor. Thus, China, which faces a major impact of climate change, should play along with Europe if it wishes to obtain an agreement that is not solely based on minimal (national) contributions."
"At the heart of the company's strategy for a long time, and compounded by globalisation, innovation is becoming increasingly collaborative, open to external organisations such as suppliers who can play a prominent role in innovations (product or service design, organisational or technical).  As Purchasing is the internal/external interface, this function may have an impact on the companies' ability to innovate. Beyond the suppliers' contribution, and within the other departments, the purpose of this thesis is to help clarify and characterise innovation by the Purchasing department, a multi-faceted notion, as well as identify the endogenous and exogenous factors conducive to innovation."
"Since the Industrial Revolution, systems of production and consumption of goods have followed consecutive technological, organizational and political innovations phases. But they have shown a certain permanence in the objectives that underlie and justify the modalities of their organization. These goals are those conveyed by merchant society in which economic exchange is a way to create wealth and meet consumer needs. The quest for continuous improvement in supply productivity and the growth in volume and diversity of goods and services required have helped shaping a globalized trading economic system as the best way to create wealth and make it circulate. However, over the past few decades, this system has reached its limits, both in environmental and social terms, and it has led the stakeholders to consider new ways to efficiently meet the needs of consumers. Among these means, the functional economy aims at proposing new ways of creating value by substituting the sale of the use of a good to the sale of the good itself. Often associated with a model that allows to disconnect the response to the needs of the use of material resources, but also to re-territorialize productive activities that have been disjointed from their geographical areas of consumption, this practice questions as to its ability to make the classical paradigm of mass production and consumption evolve. Is it a simple organizational tool meant to limit the negative impacts of the economic system without modifying the purposes or, on the contrary, a way to change the trajectory and change the goals it pursues? This thesis seeks to answer this question by approaching the functional economy through the representations of the quality exchange that it implies in action. It relies on the economy of conventions to characterize the different legitimate qualities of the exchange. It aims at determining which ones bring changes in the modalities of exchange without impacting its fundamental principles and which bring changes in the philosophy of economic exchange and its accepted purposes. As an innovative means serving an unchanged goal or as a new end that constrains as much as it incites the actors, the functional economy is likely to produce heterogeneous territorial and sustainable effects, in both situations. This work seeks to characterize the dynamics of change at stake, so as to understand how legitimated representations of the functional economy can be translated into differentiated motives and effects. It therefore creates the necessary framework for understanding the converging or diverging trajectories of legitimate functional economies. In this way, it constitutes a first step to consider the different combinations of representations likely to contribute to the emergence of territorially sustainable economic systems according to the objectives pursued by the actors."
"Most countries recognize that a coordinated worldwide action to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has to be implemented. However, the countries inability to coordinate their efforts led to the failure of the top-down climate architecture. Today, the international climate governance adopts a different direction, which based on bottom-up approach. This approach promotes polycentric and multi-level governances, that induce several independent policy-makers in different administrative scales (province, state and region). Therefore, the actual implemented Emission Trading Systems (ETS), as well as the emerging ones, grow in a domestic context. This context, in terms of economic development, political commitment and geographical coverage, determine the ETS design. Then, there is no harmonized design among ETS, no universal diffusion of these mechanisms in the world and a lack of integral inclusion of all sectors in these carbon markets. While researchers and policy-makers discuss the optimal features of such systems, this thesis examines different configuration options and coverage areas for the tradable permit schemes.Using a world energy-economy partial equilibrium simulation model (POLES) and drawing on experiences with real-world ETSs (based on empirical literature), we recommend two types of adjustments: the restrictions on trade permits between sectors, in one hand, and the control of international permit exchange between ETS, in the second hand. Indeed, we demonstrate firstly the necessity to separate ETS by sector and adapt them considering the specificities of each sector. This kind of policy will stimulate innovation in each  sector. Also, it will limit the impacts on the international competitiveness and it will lead climate policy to other economic policies. Secondly, we develop a model to describe the effects of exchange permits emissions considering international linking among emissions trading systems. We prove that restriction exchange mechanisms are necessary to insure the redistribution of exchange gain compared to full linking. At the same time, these trade restriction mechanisms minimize the total cost and increase GHG emissions reductions compared to a segmented market.Considering the diversity of national political objectives and the bottom-up context of world climate framework, we concluded that the coexistence of several carbon prices is unavoidable and necessary. Encouraging the development of several carbon prices can promote political acceptability, strengthen environmental efficiency and improve economic efficiency."
"This research focuses on the role of a strategic scanning in innovation projects. More specifically, it focuses on the role of information from a strategic scanning on decision-making throughout an innovation process. The question of research is: what is the influence of a strategic scanning on decision making during the innovation process? The objective is to enrich the knowledge on a topic that has been little addressed in the literature and which meets real management problems. The originality of the article is to mobilize the theory of decision in situation (Klein's naturalistic approach) to study decision-making in innovation processes as a complex decision and thus the influence that strategic scanning can have on complex decisions. This research was conducted through a qualitative exploratory approach of 23 interviews. Our results show that strategic scanning has three roles during the innovation process. The role of environmental exploration implies that the day before feeds the innovation process to almost all phases. The influence of the watch tends to fade before it is regained once the innovation is introduced on the market. The second role is to confirm the decision maker’s intuition. Decision makers must make complex decisions of type GO/KILL/HOLD/RECYCLE and seek their intuition that they confirm thanks to the previous day. The third role of strategic scanning is to reduce the uncertainty that characterizes innovation processes by providing strategic information about the company's external environment. Finally, this research shows that strategic scanning is useful to make decisions when it is focused on strategic research axes and that its results are shared through rich media, either at face-to-face meetings with visual presentation in the form of infographics for example."
"The enrollment rate in higher education in Cambodia has risen rapidly in the last two decades. Nevertheless, concerns on the graduates' employability exist: University graduates seem to be more and more struggled to find jobs corresponding to their level and field of education, the so-called vertical and horizontal mismatches.This thesis aims at examining the impacts of educational mismatches among graduates in developing countries with a special attention to the Cambodia's case.Chapter 1 examines the relation between education-job mismatches and unemployment duration among graduates in Cambodia. Theoretically, by assuming that job seekers can only access to limited information about the available job opportunities, they face two alternative choices between accepting the first job offer that can be mismatched to their qualification and staying unemployed to wait for a better suitable job. In contrast, if workers are heterogeneous and the job opportunities are limited, it is possible that some workers may fail to find a matched position and stay unemployed for a longer duration.This chapter contributes to the literature in three points. First, we extend the research into the developing country. Second, we take into account the endogeneity of educational mismatches and consider them in their both forms and all dimensions: Vertical or horizontal, single or double mismatch. Third, we propose an analysis from two angles: A theoretical model and an empirical model applied on a survey data in 2011 from nineteen higher education institutions (HEI) in Cambodia. The results underline that unemployment duration increases with the risks of mismatches.Chapter 2 examines whether education-job mismatches lower individual wages. There exists a theoretical consensus on the negative impact of mismatches on wages. Indeed, working in a mismatched job would not allow workers to exploit their potential skills, and consequently they would be less productive and earn less than if they were employed in a matched occupation. Yet, some limits remain in empirical studies.Hence, this chapter contributes to the literature in three points. First, it analyzes another case of developing country, while the existing studies focus on relatively more advanced countries. Second, it analyzes the combination effects of vertical and horizontal mismatches.  Third, we take into account the selection bias problem by proposing an ordered Heckman model applied on a survey data from eight HEI in Cambodia in 2014. The econometric results allow us concluding that wages decrease with the level of mismatches.Chapter 3 examines the impacts of overeducation on economics growth in thirty-eight developing countries. Two theoretical approaches confront each another. First, a worker's productivity depends on both job attributes and individual characteristics. Thus, overeducated workers are more productive than their counterparts in the same job, which is good for the economic growth.  In contrast, overeducated workers may be dissatisfied with their jobs, which induces to counterproductive behaviors, such as high rates of absenteeism and turnover, that is bad for the growth outcome.Hence, this chapter contributes to the literature in two points. First, this chapter contributes in terms of data, allowing to analyze the impacts of overeducation on economic growth in developing countries. Second, this chapter deals with unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity of overeducation by employing two-stage least squares regression with country fixed-effects. The results show that overeducation has a negative impact on economic growth"
"This thesis aims at measuring the effects of innovation policies. It first focuses on the effects of the European Union (EU) policy titled Framework Programmes for Research and Development (FPs) on the regional innovation of the EU 27 countries. Thereafter, it brings a deep analysis of the effects of the French Competitiveness Clusters policy on firms’ innovation process and on their performances.The originality of the thesis lies in the mobilization of innovative  macro and micro-econometric techniques to evaluate public policies. The results of this work will inform the role and effectiveness of the Framework Programmes for Research and Development in regional innovation dynamics, but also the effectiveness of the Competitiveness Clusters policy on French firms’ performances in terms of innovation, incentives for private investments, job creation and market competitiveness."
"Corporate Social Performance (CSP) has received a significant attention from scholars and practitioners. However, the study of the concept is often limited to its “results” dimension, focusing on measurement only. On the other hand, its managerial dimension has mostly been ignored and the concept of “stakeholders management”, a rather vague and ambiguous one, remains as CSP only managerial lever in the literature.    This research seeks to fill that gap and develops a new CSP model. Its new managerial dimension comprises a set of managerial levers at strategic, tactic and operational levels and explicitly takes stakeholders’ role into account. As this research focuses on mountain resorts, the model’s relevance for such a unit of analysis has been assessed by confronting it to mountain resorts’ specificities identified through a systematic literature review.     From a methodological point of view, 4 mountain resorts located in the French Alps have been studied through two (exploratory and confirmatory) case study methodologies. Primary data consists of transcripts of the 71 semi-directive interviews conducted with stakeholders from the political, civilian and economic spheres in the 4 resorts. Secondary data has also been collected.     Despite the “economic tropism” observed in all 4 resorts, results show that stakeholders have a role to play on each three levels of social performance management and that this role may vary according to stakeholders’ power and legitimacy in the resort. They also show that integrating stakeholders in social performance management is a mean, for them, to better take their social responsibilities into account.    From a theoretical perspective, the research contributes to the stakeholders’ approach of CSP by explicitly taking its managerial dimension into account and replacing it next to its “results” dimension. From a managerial point of view, we propose recommendations to help mountain resorts to embrace a wider – economic, social and environmental – view of performance"
"This PhD dissertation consists of three essays relating to gender concerns among financial analysts. The empirical results of the first study provide evidence for under-representation of female analysts and confirm that national culture exerts a material impact on female representation among financial analysts across European countries under study. In the second study, I document evidence that male analysts are more likely to issue innovative recommendations than female analysts, due to their relative overconfidence. Finally, the findings of third study suggest that innovative recommendations trigger larger market reactions but there is no gender difference in market reactions to innovative recommendations. The empirical findings of my dissertation complement prior literature on financial analysts, more specifically, gender-based difference in financial market decision making."
"Stress, burnout, well-being, work conditions, psychosocial risks, occupational health covers multiple notions. We choose to consider health according to the conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989, 1998, 2001). Its major contributions consist firstly in considering health not only from a pathogenic aspect but also from a salutogenic one (Abord de Chatillon, 2005 ; Neveu, 2007, 2012 ; Richard, 2012). Secondly, it proposes to study health as a whole process including its internal and external aspects. The issue of this study is to analyse both the process of maintenance and decline of occupational health in the specific public context. For several decades, this sector has been undergoing major transformations with New Public Management reforms. Although economically necessary this rationalization results in work intensification which influence work organization and health of public agents. Thus, our qualitative study through the three articles considers that occupational health is a dynamic process (in which individuals, collective and organization participate) expressed through the relationship to resources. Our thesis offers several contributions to help identify new organizational resources, to highlight the process of resource mobilization and the proactive capacity, to explicit the spiral process and to confirm the link, not sufficiently explored, between the NPM and job stress."
"Between Saint-Simon death in 1825 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, saint-simonians have been engaged in a variety of entrepreneurial projects. Willing to put an end to the French Revolution and to develop a new humanism, they have initiated both large capitalist ventures of public interest and workers’ cooperatives. Mainstream economic analysis often puts aside the role of institutions and ideologies in economic development movements. Saint-Simon and his followers anticipated the central role of firm as a key capitalist institution. Based on a physiological framework they viewed corporation as a living organism inscribed in a natural and social evolution, which raises the question of the nature and the limits of the firm in the perspective of their techno-economic emancipation project.Now that corporate social responsibility is a matter of concern, this research on the history of economic thought looks at an organizational fact: the firm as common good. First, we analyse, Saint-Simon thought and the way he connects man, corporation and society via work and industry. A second part is dedicated to three saint-simonians who implemented their ways of thinking: Enfantin in an internationalist perspective, Buchez under Christian spirituality and Leroux in search of liberal socialism."
"City logistics, considered as the last step of supply chain management, aims to optimally plan, manage and control the freight movements within a logistical network in urban areas. Freight transportation causes significant negative impacts on the quality of living in urban areas in terms of congestion, emissions and space consumption. Collaboration has been introduced to alleviate these negative impacts; however, collaboration in city logistics projects is challenging, since additional efforts of planning and control of collaboration are significant. In recent years, pooling has emerged as a collaborative strategy that leads towards systematic collaboration between stakeholders involved while they are well-informed about the processes and have direct influence on decision making.The aim of this thesis is to study possible forms of pooling in the context of city logistics in order to analyse conditions for an efficient pooling implementation. To this end, we have conducted a comprehensive literature review on city logistics in order to analyse and classify its different aspects. Surveying the literature also conducted to identify a lack of systematic analysis on pooling in city logistics. In order to overcome this research gap, we have proposed a general stepwise framework that aids to identify all necessary steps toward an efficient pooling implementation. Furthermore, we have introduced a novel concept, called ‘typology of flow’, to analyse different possibilities of logistics pooling at a first step and to identify potential constraints before pooling implementation at a second step. We have quantified the impacts of these constraints on the efficiency of pooling using a real case raised from the literature. At the end, we have used our proposed framework, novel concept of typology of flow and results obtained from our experimental analysis in order to classify important factors for city logistics pooling viability in long term."
"This thesis examines how consumers respond to incentives used to encourage a reduction in their energy consumption. This necessary reduction stems from the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy production from renewable energy sources and achieve energy savings. These objectives require that residential demand be more flexible in response to changes in supply and that energy savings be achieved by households. The first chapter explores the barriers to consumer acceptance and adoption of smart meters and the incentives that they provide. Significant barriers exist and consumption reductions are far from being achieved. Limited motivation, lack of understanding of information on consumption and the rigidity of daily life are the main barriers preventing households from acting upon the incentives delivered via smart meters. The second chapter analyses the results of field experiments and pilot studies on the impacts of different incentives on residential consumption. The results show that there are large variations and that, on average, an incentive will result in a 2% reduction in energy consumption. Real-time feedback and monetary information have the greatest effect. Finally, more robust studies report lower reduction effects. In the third chapter, a common pool resource game is used to explore individual responses to price and nudge-based incentives. Individuals are encouraged to reduce their consumption either by price increases or by smilies that reflect their overconsumption. The price is most effective at encouraging the target level of consumption but takes longer to have an effect. The nudge is quickly understood but tends to reinforce overconsumption behaviours. The fourth chapter examines the effect of framing on effort provision. Individuals are asked to complete a simple and repetitive task for which they receive a piece-rate payoff in the form of a gain or loss. Framing in the form of gains and losses is combined with three different payment structures: fixed gain, low gain or high gain with an equal probability revealed before or after the effort is made. The results show that framing has no effect on effort provision, except for a high gain context announced before making the effort."
"While self-efficacy appears as a main behaviour’s explanatory variable, little research has been conducted regarding the potential mechanisms that could improve self-efficacy in the specific context of marketing communication. Moreover, despite the strong stakes linked with organ and gamete donations, such causes have received little attention from researchers in social marketing and persuasive communication. Through research, vicarious experience (observation learning) appeared as one of the main levers of self-efficacy. The objective was to transpose this vicarious experience in an imaginary context by activating transportation mental imagery. This transportation experience, provoked by narrative communications and involving receiver’s identification to the main character of the story, leads to receiver’s desire to look like the donor and to the reinforcement of their self-efficacy to donate their organs / gametes. Two independent studies were conducted in order to test and validate the proposed research model. Contributions and limits of this research are highlighted and potential future research directions are presented."
"SMEs (Small and Medium sized Enterprises) confront resource scarcity during innovative projects. Thereby they are increasingly taking part in collaborative networks to access the required complementary knowledge for conducting their projects. To achieve this, SMEs deploy their absorptive capacity (ACAP) which means their ability to acquire, assimilate, transform and apply external knowledge. ACAP can be integrated via diverse practices called routines when they are repeated and accepted collectively. However, organisation’s actors often perform these routines unconsciously. Thus, enhancing knowledge absorption requires highlighting applied routines to acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge.This interdisciplinary thesis aims at: (i) Proposing a new participative method called ISEACAP (Identification, Simulation, Evaluation and Amelioration of Absorptive Capacity) based on gamification techniques. (ii) Providing a refine level of applied knowledge and ACAP’s routines during innovative project by detailing related practices to each dimension of ACAP (acquisition, assimilation, transformation and application). (iii) Highlighting roles of ISEACAP’s facilitators during experimental sessions to raise reflexivity among participants (organisations’ actors). (iv) Describing role of ISEACAP’s phases to facilitate learning on ACAP’s routines for actors.Applied methodology during this thesis relies on qualitative analysis of collected data through semi-structured interviews and experimental sessions via ISEACAP. Based on the conducted interviews and experimental sessions in France and UK with practitioners, in different activity sectors, two case studies had been developed in textile and food sectors. Collected data from these two cases were coded and analysed thematically. Considering the results, this thesis contributes in engineering science by proposing and formalising a new gamified participative method (ISEACAP), and in management science, the contribution relies on providing a better understanding of ACAP’s routines."
"Organization citizenship behavior (OCB) is relatively new concept considered under Organizational Behavior. The reason for choosing OCB as a research ground is its positive relationship with unit performance. Research has shown that OCB helps maximize the organizational performance of companies (Podsakoff et al., 2000). Since this is the goal of every organization, it benefits managers to understand how various variables affect OCB. This understanding can help managers assess what kind of environment to provide their employees, and also what motivates and satisfies them. Nowadays, most of researching in the field of OB held in the geographical context of western culture. As Vietnam particularly and Asia in general are different from the rest of the world, if culture is made the origin of segregation, Gautam et al. (2006) argues that OCB may vary, with change in geographic context; OCB is enacted differently in differently cultural contexts. In Vietnam, many western multinational companies are moving in this region because of cheap labor and immense potential market, so this study would principally be targeted to help in a better understanding of the OCB in a different geographical context."
"The first paper stemmed from this thesis seeks to explore the determinants of the capital structure of Vietnamese listed companies, with an emphasis on outside ownership. The empirical results demonstrate that the proportion of state investment has no linear impact on firm leverage. The results, however, reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship. Besides, our empirical results show that the proportions of foreign investment and large holders are negatively associated with short-term, total and market leverage. There is no evidence about the non-linear relationship between foreign and large ownership and the capital structure of observed firms.The second study aims to explore some new aspects of the issue of adjustment speed toward the target leverage for Vietnamese publicly quoted firms by adopting a partial adjustment model. Through testing the existence of the target leverage and estimating the speed of adjustment, the study tries to find evidence of heterogeneity in adjustment behavior. Indeed, the assumption that the speed of adjustment is the same for all firms is inconsistent with the argument of the tradeoff theory which states that firms readjust their leverage by comparing the costs and benefits of adjustment. For different firms, these elements are different, leading to heterogeneity in speed. Even for a single company, the speed could change over time. To have an in-depth overview of the adjustment mechanism, this study goes inside different sub-samples of firms, i.e., above versus below the target; close versus far from the target; deficit versus surplus firms.The last essay belonging to the thesis provides the first ever evidence of the changes of adjustment behaviors over the business life cycle of Vietnam quoted firms from 2005 to 2017. The outcomes show that the adjustment speed towards the target leverage varies significantly across the five phases of life, and reaches the highest level in the stage of introduction. The results also indicate that the cash flow pattern is a more reliable proxy of business life cycle stages than firm age and growth rate. Our empirical evidence supports the pecking order theory as the best-fit framework to understand the funding behavior of Vietnam listed firms throughout corporate life."
"At a time when companies, faced with many upheavals, are more than ever in search of performance, and when employees, denouncing working conditions and managerial practices, have never been so demanding of well-being at work, reconciling employee well-being and company performance is a topical issue and a strategic challenge for companies.The literature review and the results of an exploratory qualitative analysis conducted using semi-directive interviews with 55 employees of the RESSIF group (Réseau des Services Sociaux Interentreprises de France) lead us to consider ""well-being at work"" and ""company performance"" in terms of paradoxical meta-perspective and to propose ways to resolve this organizational paradox.To do this, we conducted two quantitative studies. The first study is based on 5300 observations from the working conditions survey of the French Ministry of Labor. The second is based on the answers of 270 companies to an online questionnaire on human resources management practices.Finally, our empirical results conclude that the factors that make it possible to reconcile well-being at work and company performance are, among working conditions, the fight against work intensity and unsustainability and, among human resources practices, the development of employee participation in company decisions, training, promotions and career perspectives and, to a lesser extent, performance evaluation.To conclude this work, theoretical, methodological and managerial contributions are presented, as well as future research paths."
"To preserve their business model, companies have long protected their innovation processes with patents. « Open source hardware » (OSH) is, on the contrary, a collaborative product development process, where design plans and manufacturing ""secrets"" are accessible to all. The lines between creators and consumers blur more and more, especially when, for example, digital fabrication tools such as 3D printers or laser cutters accessible via Fab Labs or Maker Spaces, enable citizens to create and test products much more easily. Starting from an isolated phenomenon, there are now 1200 Fab Labs in 100 different countries organized in a ""Fab City Network"", to help cities produce within forty years 50% of the resources they consume.In this context, building a drone to depollute oceans, connected beehives, or a water filter in  « Open Source Hardware » (OSH) aims at creating solutions in a more rapid, efficient and inexpensive manner.  Furthermore, these innovations are voluntarily kept free by law. They represent a knowledge base, a ""digital common good"", meaning a reserve of ideas and solutions available on the internet via numerical platforms. According to Elinor Ostrom, who received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009, ""the challenge of the current generation is to keep the pathways to discovery open"" (Hess & Ostrom, 2011). Without attaining the success of open source software initiatives, in practice, these OSH initiatives have continued to spread.But how can a sustainable economic model be developed when co-constructed innovations can be shared by all?  Thus, our research questions are the following: 1) How to monetize value created through OSH? 2) How can the business model framework be extended to include value creation and sharing for all stakeholders? 3) In the context of OSH, how does a business model hold together?The OSH phenomenon is not specific to a single sector, company or territory, but is indicative of much more global transformation.  To understand the conditions necessary for the survival and growth of OSH, we conducted a qualitative study on the “OSH ecosystem” that allowed us to study the community, firm and territorial ecosystems levels together.Data was collected in three successive phases.  First, qualitative interviews were conducted with twenty-three initiatives from the ""Open Source Hardware Observatory"". These, of course, corresponded to our research criteria, that is the development of complex mechatronic or textile products labeled opened by their surrounding community.  Then we conducted a case study on four actors in the automotive sector to study their reaction to OSH developed by innovation communities. The final phase consisted of running an empirical study of the actors in the OSH innovation ecosystem of the city of Barcelona, chosen for its pivotal role in the ""Fab Cities"" network.Our results show that these initiatives are strongly focused on democratic values aimed at putting technology at the service of humanity.  While these values are a powerful vector for federating actors, success is stalled in companies that do not adhere to them. These will primarily focus on the associated risks.  Finally, we identified a diversity of possible and configurable revenues to be shaped according to an organization's strategic needs: 1) external financing; 2) a combination of products and services; 3) strategic competence; 4) the model platform, and 5) the distributed enterprise.  Together, they enable an OSH initiative to progressively refine its business model, grow in value, and increase its impact."
"This thesis consists of two main topics: the impact of brand territory of origin (TOO) on consumer behaviour, and the impact of conspicuous consumption on consumer subjective well-being (SWB).On one side, this thesis highlights the importance of territory associations for consumers’ perception of product authenticity and empirically tests the chain of effects, from a TOO association to perceived authenticity to consumers’ self–brand connections. An experimental method and a partial least square (PLS) approach were adopted to test hypotheses with 665 Chinese consumers. Results demonstrate that TOO exerts a positive impact on perceived product authenticity, which improves consumers’ self–brand connections. In addition, compared with country of origin (COO), TOO has a unique positive impact on perceived authenticity and a direct positive effect on consumers’ self–brand connections. Also, the positive impact of TOO on perceived authenticity is enhanced by consumers’ familiarity with the TOO and congruence between the product category and TOO. But only one outcome of TOO (perceived authenticity) and one product category (lavender soap) have been considered in this study. Noting the diminishing relevance of COO associations, this study demonstrates that territory of origin is an appealing alternative strategy for strengthening brand equity.On the other side, despite the growing importance of conspicuous consumption in all parts of the world, little research focuses on the effect of conspicuous consumption on consumer SWB, and when this is the case, the results are controversial. We propose and test a bi-motive hypothesis whereby the valence of the effect of conspicuous consumption on consumer SWB depends on whether the conspicuous object is used as self-signaling conspicuous consumption or other-signaling conspicuous consumption. The results of three studies demonstrate that the self-signaling conspicuous consumer has a significantly higher level of SWB than the other-signaling conspicuous consumer. Furthermore, consumer materialism enhances the negative relationship between other-signaling conspicuous consumption and consumer SWB."
"Offsets arrangements in government procurement are discriminatory policy tools aimed at increasing local production. They reflect a transfer or a creation of new activities as a pre-condition to the validity of the purchasing contract. The governments use these mechanisms to encourage local development or to improve the balance-of-payments. In spite of the broad utilization of offset practices, they are relatively unknown and little described in academic literature. The goal of this thesis is to define, to explain and to assess the importance of these practices in the international trade and to provide a theoretical framework within which it will be possible to critically appraise the success of an offset policy (its effectiveness and efficiency) for host countries. In order to take into account the success factors for an offset policy, the relationship between the host country and the obligor as well as the result of this relationship is examined through the game theory approach. By applying this general framework to the study of South African Offset policy and more particularly to the evaluation of 121 civil offset projects provided between 1996 and 2012, under the Strategic Defense Package purchase we find the following results: at the conclusion of public procurement contracts, South-African offset projects hold out promises of important economic benefits for the country. Nevertheless, during the implementation process, many violations of rules and procedures decrease the positive impact of these projects and hinder their effectiveness. The lack of transparency in the negotiation process, the selection and the execution phase of offset projects show that South Africa did not obtain best value for public money.  It is difficult to appraise global program efficiency because of lack of data and analysis problems. However the estimated impact remains positive."
"The consequences of our modes of production and consumptions on the global environment have been recognized and analyzed for many decades: climate change, biodiversity collapse, tensions on numerous strategic resources etc. Our work follows a line of thought aiming at developing other indicators of wealth, alternative to the Growth Domestic Product. In particular, in a perspective of strong sustainability, we focus on biophysical (non-monetary) accounting, with the objective of pinpointing environmental externalities. A large part of existing research in this domain being targeted towards national levels, we rather focus on subnational scales, with on strong emphasis on French regions. With decentralization policies, these territories are indeed given increasing jurisdiction and also benefit from greater margins of action than national or international levels to implement a transition to sustainability. After studying the characteristic of existing tools used in the fields of ecological economics and industrial ecology, such as the Ecological Footprint, Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment or Input-Output Analysis, we focus on supply chains that we analyze through the quantities of materials they mobilize during the production, transformation, transport and consumption steps. The method developed, the Supply-Chain MFA, provides coherent flow diagrams at the national scale, but also in every region and, when data allow it, at infra-regional levels. These diagrams are based on a systematic reconciliation process of available data. We assess the precision of input data, which allows to provide confidence interval on results, and in turn, to put the light on lacks of knowledge. In particular, we provide a detailed uncertainty assessment of the French domestic road freight survey (TRM), a crucial piece of the Supply-Chain MFA. By doing so, we show that undertaking the study on a period of several years not only solves the issue of stocks but also significantly reduces uncertainties on trade flows between regions. We then adapt the Absorbing Markov Chains framework to trace flows to their final destination and to allocate environmental pressures occurring all along the supply chain. For instance, in the case of cereals, we study energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, the blue water footprint, land use and the use of pesticides. Material flows can also be coupled with economic modeling in order to forecast how they will likely respond to certain policies. In collaboration with the laboratory of forest economics (LEF), we thusly provide the first attempt of representing the whole French forest-wood supply-chain, and we analyze the impact of a set of policies on both the economy and physical flows. Finally, we show the opportunities of linking these supply-chain results with qualitative methods unfold in the domain of territorial ecology, stakeholder analysis in particular. We situate our work in the normative framework of deliberative democracy and are therefore interested in the contributions of biophysical accounting to public decision processes that include diverse stakeholders. We propose an overview of decision modes, key steps of decision-aiding, multicriteria methods, but also of the various forms taken by citizen participation. We eventually design a deliberation-aiding method, based on elicitation of each stakeholder’s satisfaction and regret regarding a given future. It aims at organizing the discussion on an apparent consensus mode, which by nature facilitates the respect of minorities. Finally, based on the main criticisms addressed to quantification, we propose in conclusion thoughts on the conditions that could put biophysical accounting at the service of democratic emancipation."
"The management of knowledge and innovation are the themes to strong importance today, especially because these two topics are linked and they influence the performance of firms. The objective of this research is to analyze the link between knowledge management and innovation from three industries of simple product in the industrial pole of Barcarena city, Pará State, Brazil. We want to evaluate both the relationship of Knowledge Management in these companies and their innovative capacity, to understand the influence of knowledge for the innovative capacity, especially incremental innovation. For this, we will use models of analysis which take into account factors such as culture, leadership, technology, human resources and process. Our methodological approach is qualitative. We choose as basic concepts and theoretical literature about the Knowledge Management and Innovation. The axis of the industry was chosen by its economic importance in the region where the research has been developed. We interviewed 24 employees at Imerys S.A., Hydro Alunorte S.A. and Alubar S.A. This research has highlighted the role of the leader in the incremental innovation, the importance of the sense of urgency for the corporate culture innovative. In addition, according to the results of the companies that better manage the knowledge have more possibiliter to innovate."
"In our growing service economy, designing innovative services is critical. But how is the value of innovative services designed? Our thesis questions how the immaterial and experiential value of innovative services is shaped, and especially the role of visual representations in making present a service that doesn’t exist yet. We aim at answering two research questions: what are the different valuation tests that structure the service design process ? What are the different roles of visual representations, as valuation devices, in those valuation tests? Our study is based on two complementary case studies of service design projects : the first one is a pedagogical case, the second one is an industrial case. We adopt an approach in terms of valuation and consider the service design process as a collective process, in which actors express conflicts and elaborate compromises on the value of future servicesOur model shows that the value of services is shaped through a collective valuation process that is structured by valuation tests. Those valuation tests are characterized by four dimensions : the objects and registers of valuations, the actors interacting and the valuation operations performed. We show how representations support, stimulate and, sometimes, hinder the collective work on value. We highlight how their material characteristics have an impact on the valuation tests (in particular with regard to their types, their level of polishing, their level of verisimilitude and their equipment). These observations lead us to suggest two types of collective work on value: a convergence one, in which actors align their valuations and in which representations are value catalysts ; a demonstration one, in which actors try to enroll new actors in the network and in which representations are value demonstrators. Our results allow us to model the work on the value of future services: they show how this value is shaped by and in valuation test, in which visual representations are both tools for constructing the value of future services and the tools that support the actors’ social and political interactions on this value. Our model thus contributes to a better understanding of service design and of the role of visual representations in the design process. We highlight the critical and strategic part of visual representations in the value creation of services. Hence, we provide services designers and service innovation managers with keys for understanding and practicing service innovation."
"In order to understand what leads individuals to create new ventures, entrepreneurship researchers use intention models in their studies for decades. The most famous are the Theory of Planned Behavior of Azjen and the Entrepreneurial Event of Shapero and Sokol. However, these models are still perfectible. In fact, they stem from the fact that intentions predict behaviors, but only less than half of variance of entrepreneurial behaviors is explained by intention. Moreover, intention models only focus on the antecedents of intention. So the motivational part (why one acts) is addressed, but the volitional part (how to pursue actions) remains set aside.Our thesis, composed of four pieces of work, aims at addressing this gap in order to improve our understanding of the entrepreneurial process. Our objective is to shed light on facilitators that can lead from intentions to effective action. We thus took on the challenge of unveiling part of the missing links between entrepreneurial intention and behavior. We selected commitment and implementation intention in the socio-psychological literature as being the possible missing links, and we test them in entrepreneurial contexts.Thus by focusing on the volitional part, our thesis completes the intention models in order to improve our knowledge of the entrepreneurial process. It has implications for intended entrepreneurs themselves, politicians, educators and incubators.  Indeed, they could use what we have learnt about commitment and implementation intention to enhance the entrepreneurial intention conversion rate. Generally speaking, our goal is to propose new materials to help intended entrepreneurs to enact their intentions.However, the size of our samples limits our empirical studies to exploratory papers. Further researches should now test our findings quantitatively."
"This thesis focuses on the understanding of sharing emotions mechanisms and collective emotional experiences in recreational event consumption situation like festivals. The emotion is studied from a collective point of view and the attention is focused on positive emotions, giving this work a double originality. We adopted an abductive process that is articulated around successive phases of ethnographic immersions in festive gatherings of the action sport and the psytrance communities, and a use of multidisciplinary literature significant to to our registration in the Consumption Cultural Theory (CCT) research stream.Our results show that transfers of emotion are central in the event consumer experience. The process of emotional sharing and emotional contagion are ubiquitous and contribute to the creation of collective emotions that the experience is sought by the festival consumer or the event spectator. These emotional dynamics that are closely linked with the notion of belonging to the community, are shaping the consumption logics of the festival visitors, and are influencing their relation to the experience. The socio-cultural anchor of emotional dynamics is also confirmed by our results.Understanding the experience with the collective emotional dimension has allowed us to offer a unique approach to the experience and specific analytical frameworks to the context of festivals and live performances. In addition, this work opens many research perspectives on new concepts that our analysis was to update, such as emotional leader, emotional style and emotional density"
"This research focuses on a new form of marketing oriented toward human and social values. The concept of hospitality allows for the humanization of e-commerce so it can meet the objectives of this new form of marketing 3.0. We thus aim to answer the following research question: how can the pure players web-sellers strategies be settle within the values of the marketing 3.0.? Our literature review goes through different disciplinary fields and provides a global and precise approach of the concept of hospitality facilitating its transposition into a digitalized environment. We use a quantitative approach to complete factorial plan and make it possible to verify the impact of virtual hospitality on the Internet user’s behaviors. Concretely, creating merchant websites based on this concept can increase positive affective reactions, cognitive absorption, approach behaviors and purchase intention. Conversely, affective reactions with negative valence and avoidance behaviors are reduced. The dissertation concludes that it is possible to humanize a digital interface but this humanization form does not replace the real human presence. However, it brings benefits for consumers who derive some experience in shipping and for the company’s development since the approach behaviors and the purchase intention are more important."
"The Rhône-Alpes economy is increasingly specializing in diverse service activities, such as consulting and assistance services, health and social action, commerce sector, hotels and restaurants, and operational services, along with the building sector. Employment precarization – defined as the persistent combination of low wages and job insecurity– especially affects young employees, both in Rhône-Alpes and France. Far from being limited to a transition period, this precarization persists throughout the social and professional lives of important segments of the working class. Relying on the Déclarations Annuelles de Données Sociales (DADS), we have underlined the restructuring by age and sex groups and showed regional trends as well as the distinctive sector features of employment relationship precarization. These three elements – age, sex and economic sector– are the key elements of this thesis on the precarization of youth employment and its increasing segmentation. In such a process, the sectoral and generational renewal of employment relationships combine to drive a full recomposition of service-sector wage-economies. In a period of near-general wage stagnation, youth employment is becoming increasingly precarious due to the rise of low wages, job insecurity and low career prospects in the same sector. This precarization of youth employment is both a consequence and a driving factor of the sector recomposition of employment. The concentration of young people in emerging branches reproduces the sexual segmentation of employment. This sector and generational recomposition of employment reinforces age segmentation : traditional sectors, with more decent conditions, dominated by an ageing labour force ; expanding areas of precarization, notably concerning young people; whereas strategic sectors, where employees are not so young, showing high internal inequalities. Finally, some employees – mostly women– remain locked up in low wages and job insecurity even after ageing out of the younger period cohorts. It is the precariousness as horizon throughout their (absence of) career."
"The innovation of the 21st century has no longer as a mere objective the survival of companies in the market and the stimulation of the growth at the country level. From now on, there is an urgent need to preserve the environment to ensure the development of present and future generations. Therefore, several empirical studies and theoretical accounts place the matter at the heart of innovation and economics fields of research. The first objective of this dissertation is to examine how ‐at a microeconomic level‐ the emergence and diffusion of environmental innovations is impacted by strategic inter‐firm relationships within supply‐chains. In order to achieve this goal, the first chapter shows that a monopoly maintains on the market a low‐quality product in the sole intention to increase his bargaining power against a supplier offering a drastic innovation ‐a costless high‐quality product‐. The second chapter explains how bargaining powers between vertically related firms can influence the adoption choice of environmental technology leading to a sub‐optimal level of depollution or welfare. To deal with this situation, the regulator must adapt its regulatory policy ‐a tax in this case‐ to modify the choice of the polluting firm. However, its intervention may prove insufficient under certain conditions. The second objective of the dissertation is developed in the third chapter which identifies theoretically and empirically the macroeconomic determinants of environmental innovations in order to help the regulator to better target its interventions."
"This thesis applies industrial organization to the analysis of private and collective label markets managed within cooperatives. First, we analyze theoretically how bargaining power between certifiers of labels and firms can have an effect on the level of quality offered on the market. We then show that the presence of bargaining power has the effect of lowering the standard of private certification. The analysis also shows that the presence of bargaining power can change the effectiveness of environmental regulation policies such as taxes and subsidies. Secondly, we analyze empirically how an incentive payment can reduce the free rider problem and improve the reputation of collective labels managed within cooperatives. We therefore show that quality-basedremuneration can exclude the option of defrauding members of a cooperative. Thisremuneration has a positive effect on the performance of the cooperative. These two major approaches are preceded by a review of the literature on labels certified privately for profit and collective labels."

"Demographic ageing is leading governments to prolong working life. Age management was therefore invented. However, our bibliographic review shows this concept is based on nothing but chronological age and economic considerations, which causes its own failure. Worst of all, health at work is not taken into consideration even if it’s a major problem as far as working life extension is concerned. We propose to bring it back at the center of the debate thanks to a new concept, initially called “employability through health at work over time”. Three case-studies have enabled us to test it: we analyzed how it materializes in daily current HR practices, with a particular attention given to their contexts and actors. Pichault and Nizet provide us with an analytical approach, which we completed with a theoretical framework from M. Weber’s comprehensive sociology in order to enrich our political approach with a particular focus on rationalization.As a theoretical contribution, we proposed to adapt Pichault and Nizet’s analytical framework to render it specifically suitable for the study of health questions in HR practices. As a managerial contribution, we observed that HR managers must answer a unique question: how long can/must a worker stay in a constraining job? We noticed that two different answers were provided, leading to the implementation of two distinct variations of “health-at-work driven employability and pathways management”. Some managers consider that they ought to enable employees to stay in a constraining job during their entire professional lives, in which case, health and security at work have to be taken into consideration in each of what we call “classical” HR practices, but also in dedicated practices. Other managers consider that constraining jobs can be held for a limited period of time only. In this case, beside good practices listed above, they take measures to implement what we call “flexi-security”, on a company scale, but also on a broader one."
"Energy and environmental issues are one of the main challenges for humanity in the 21st century. Global growth in energy demand links to environmental concerns including pollution, global warming and reduction of CO2 emissions. In particular, it is an urgent request in rapidly growing developing regions such as Asian countries. Using cleaner energy sources, renewable energy instead of traditional energy sources like coal and oil is an inevitable option in the future. In the current context, natural gas is seen as a clean energy source which plays a major role in the energy transition process towards a low-carbon economy. The consequences for natural gas markets are significant and the condition of this change is an abundant supply of natural gas. The development of unconventional gas, particularly shale gas, provides an opportunity to expand the global gas supply. This is illustrated by the “shale gas revolution” in US which has profoundly changed the regional gas markets. However, this ""revolution"" is hardly reproducible in other regions of the world. This thesis demonstrates particularly that apart from geological, institutional conditions (taxation, property rights), economic (prices, technologies) and organizational (free markets) are necessary for a large scale development of unconventional resources. This research also shows that most of these conditions are not met in Europe or Asia (especially in China). Therefore, an energy transition by natural gas to meet climate challenges in Asia will be solved through imports, rather than through regional production. From three scenarios of the POLES model based on assumptions about climate policy, shale gas development and rapid increase of demand for gas in the energy mix (particularly in Asia), two main conclusions emerge. The developments of shale gas with low cost in the USA make the global gas supply abundant and more competitive than other energies, particularly coal. Therefore, even without climate policy, the conditions are ripe for the increaseof natural gas proportion in the energy mix. Secondly, a strong climate policy has contradictory effects on the relative share of natural gas in the Asian energy mix. On the one hand, it allows natural gas larger penetration into the energy mix of Asia. But at the same time, with limitation of energy demand, requested natural gas volumes are only slightly higher than in scenarios without climate policy."
"Human resources management have already shown in the past the importance of the context when it comes to understand the failure or the succes of a normative apporoach. Or, despite all those researches, we notice that firms are still incited to implement these approaches without asking any question. So are african firms, forced to implement western tools. But, what is the impact of culture on a western tool imported in other context?"
"The general purpose of this thesis is to analyze the different types of values that determine and explain the choices and behavior of consumers with a particular focus on innovative products. Specifically, we want to know whether consumers are willing to pay for innovative products with sustainable features and how consumer preferences and characteristics of the product are involved in the process of the decision-making. In addition, we test new methods for such estimations.In the Chapter 1 we claim that individual preferences are reflected in willingness to pay for a product/service and are based on individual’s values. These values are stable for each individual, guide his/her preferences and actions as an individual (personal values) and as an economic agent (customer and consumer values). With the focus on the consumption of innovative and sustainable products, this thesis discusses also environmental and innovative values.The importance of value analysis for innovative products is of a high importance for companies, because it allows to anticipate preferences and their changes, and by this, helps to define the priorities of new product development processes.The complex systems of these values result in particular challenges for the estimation, discussed in Chapter 2. Therefore, the accuracy of WTP estimates depends on the choice of the method used by the researcher.The obtained results show that consumers have positive valuations of innovative products with sustainable characteristics. These valuations are based on consumers preferences and values inherent to him/her are an individual and as a consumer. The empirical studies presented in Chapters 3 and 4 offer two experimental approaches, which contribute to the understanding of consumer behavior towards innovative products and to the understanding of the difficulties and challenges for experimental methods of preference elicitation for these products/services. In addition, they demonstrate the validity of value theory in consumer behavior."

"This research discusses the importance of management for commercial enterprises but also for any organization and every institution of modern society. It aims to highlight the relationship between management and leadership. It examines the impact of leadership on the operation of a religious institution, namely the maronite Church. The goal is to offer this organization with the means to improve its performance and results in an ever changing environment that offers many challenges. The fundamental purpose of the maronite Church is spiritual and religious. Multiple objectives that the maronite Church is trying to achieve are constantly under the sign of this religious spirituality. In a world beset by political, social and economic crises as well as ethical questions, people are in desperate need of these abstract values, but they also require concrete achievements, work and efforts from the Church. This combination of values would exist in the maronite Church body through a proactive leadership that would initiate an innovative revolution in a strategic process able to adapt the mentality in the church. The systemic view of management of Peter DRUCKER is the cornerstone of this study. The leadership approach that we have developed aims to show that the managerial phenomenon finds its identity in an organizational context and can also develop in the context of a religious and organizational community."
"Generally this research consists of four parts, research background, risk identification, risk assessment and risk control suggestions. Research background consists of research introduction, author background and literature reviews on key concepts and theories, and risk formulation mechanisms. Risk identification is the first and important step of enterprise risk management. In this research, brainstorm, expert interview, RBS and literature review methods will be used together to identify the risk in Chinese air cargo industry. From theory perspective, it will explain why it chooses these methods and implements the methods comparison. Through the interview, survey with experts, two layers of risk factors have been founded. For the risk assessment methods, there are mainly about 14 independent risk assessment methods are discussed, as strategic scanning, worst-case analysis and so on. For the risk assessment of Chinese air cargo industry, ANP is a scientific, reasonable and practical method. Experts’ judgment and suggestion are indispensable and complementary in risk assessment, including ANP method. Because of the practice of risk identification, the author has a close relationship with most of the experts within Chinese air cargo industry. 20 experts were chosen as the interviewees. Based on the 17 valid questionnaires and Superdecision software, risk assessment process produced all priorities for all the risk factors. According the result, 19 risks are classified into three categories, red, yellow and white risks. For each kind of risks, all the participants can make risk counter decisions according to the assessment result. Risk assessment is not the end for risk management for Chinese air cargo industry, the purpose of the risk assessment is to support the decision making and bring inferences. In China, the Ecargo is one practice of ACSCEP which is proposed by China government. In all, ACSCEP can solve many Chinese air cargo risks. As an expert and member of Ecargo platform, I proposed that Ecargo is a good risk counter measures."
"This thesis shows the interest of cotton in African economy particularly in Malian one founded about 70% on primary sector in that agricultural part is estimated between 60 and 70%. This last also employees 70% of working population. Following many perturbations ten years ago, on cotton world market, several questions appear concerning the future of this product. Therefore, in the first time, the historic analysis of statistic data with tables, graphics, pictures prove the cotton importance in Mali, Africa and the world in multiple dimensions (economic, social , cultural and in environment). In this situation, appear many conflicts which conduct to a called phenomenon “cotton war “. Many historic and geopolitics reasons, explain this cotton world war which main characteristics are no limit discussions and negotiations at the World Trade Organization which is unable to oblige members to respect its main rules that are to forbid tariffs and trade barriers and others specially by “price makers “ countries. Another characteristic of cotton war is the question of important American, European and Chinese subsidies paid by developed countries in favor of its producers in an error to disadvantage of poor countries producers singularly Africans. Several studies based on models and corporate assets certificate negative impacts between subsidies amount and world cotton price estimated by index A “cotlook”. This direct politics effect bears the world market of cotton about an average rate of 15% (between 3 to 28% by cases). In order to stop these subventions distortions, many agreements are founded about the cotton question, in first African Sector Initiative, a group of four cotton producer countries, since Cancun Ministry Conference in 2003, September, in the second position are UEMOA actions in favor it's cotton areas and the partnership European Union (EU)-Africa on cotton. Finally, in the third and last party of this thesis, cotton problem is highest than price and aids simple questions which are issue as temporary. Thereby, many scientists suggest, after giving up subsidies, structural reforms of African cotton sectors by liberalizing , creating transformation cotton factories, opportunity to farm others products without conventional cotton and without forgetting formal bilateral and multilateral aids in order to help strongly in the future actions undertaken in favor of cotton."
"Topic of interest : With the advent of Web 2.0, the interpersonal influence now includes its extension in cyberspace with electronic word of mouth. Therefore, the Internet deeply modify relationships between consumer and the brand and led to a redefinition of the relationship brand -consumer. Web 2.0 appears as a great tool rebalancing powers between them. However, beyond this, we wonder about the asymmetry between consumer and brand in these conversations: is marketing willing to play the game? What perception the consumer has of this rebalancing? Research Objective : The objective of this research is to understand the perceptions of Web 2.0 by consumers and resulting behaviors.Thesis defended : Faced with this redefinition of the relationship between the consumer and the brand, we suggest that companies wishing to engage consumers must agree to give up some power. Contribution expected : This thesis aims to contribute to previous studies and to overcome their limitations. While the academic literature explores the motivations of consumers to post online reviews in general (Hennig -Thurau & al , 2004; Sher &Lee, 2009) , it lacks empirical studies considering the impact of individual factors on their consumer participation and engagementtoward a particular brand on the web 2.0 . Thus, we seek to understand the role of consumer power capacities on online participation and engagement. Method : Our research methodology consists in a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Firstly, a qualitative study and a quantitative study were conducted with consumers in a tourism context. It was held in collaboration with the tourist offices of the Grand-Bornand and Aix-les-Bains. Secondly, an experiment was conducted among young consumers (18 to 30 years) in the specific sector of Smartphones and mobile tablets. Main results The qualitative study allowed us to initially highlight multiple paradoxes generated by eWOM broadcast on opinion platforms. EWOM appears useful for consumers and businesses; however, a strong skepticism is facing them. The first quantitative study allowed us to highlight the determinants of participation and engagement: Helping company, perceived sincerity of posted comment, consumer skepticism regarding online practices and brand attachment. In general, we see consumer willingness to influence.The second quantitative study, the experimentation, shows that the characteristics of online opinion platforms have an impact on the intention of engaging and engaged behavior. This study shows the importance of online review accuracy of and the small risk for an online opinion platform to become a way to get out consumers anger."
"With the Globalization of Markets there is an opening of borders, new commercial trade, and increase in competition. Local production systems have adapted by looking at introducing cheaper production methods. Typical industrial areas reduce their activity and turn to new assets such as services. Older industrial areas have suffered and suffer reduction and transformation process as summarized in the de-industrialization model. Competition is increased by the new skills and technologies acquired so new enterprises can develop and endure. In order to support technological innovation Pôle de Compétitivité in Rhône Alpes and Poli di Innovazione in Piedmont were born. On the basis of this scenario the central question of this thesis is: “ In the presence of two urban centers like Grenoble and Turin, with similar properties of de-industrialization, do two similar public policies lead to similar results?” “Are there two different development models for Grenoble and Turin”? As to methodology, after a literature analysis I carried fieldwork and some interviews with managers meso-structures selected in the two urban areas. This thesis asserts that policies of Pôle de Compétitivité and Pôles d'Innovation show important differences."
"This study mainly aims to investigate the origin of the global financial crisis of 2007 (2007 GFC) in United States and in other advanced economies(AEs),its macroeconomic impact on the Emerging Market Economies(EMEs) and the critical analysis of their policy response. Study highlights the regulatory challenges of the post-crisis period and discusses the implications of newly introduced regulatory reforms for the EMEs.In this aim the thesis is delineated into four chapters. First chapter of the thesis sets the theoretical context of the dissertation and presents a critical review of orthodox (mainstream/neoliberal) and the heterodox approaches on financial fragility and crisis. After giving a critique of the orthodox approach, merits and relevance of Minsky's framework known as “Financial Instability Hypothesis”(FIH) are emphasized to understand the issue of fragility in capitalist economies. Second chapter of the thesis provides a compelling compendium of various explanations and consequences of the 2007 GFC focusing on its origination in the US housing market. Main dysfunctions of the financial markets and the regulatory system that led to the eruption of financial crisis are highlighted. Third chapter presents an in-depth analysis of the contagion of the 2007 GFC to EMEs. A comparative case studies analysis highlights the policy response of selected EMEs. Fourth chapter of the thesis investigates the various financial regulatory reforms introduced in the aftermath of the 2007 GFC. Analysis in this chapter indicates that introduced reforms (The Dodd- Franck Act of 2011 and the new Basel III Banking Standards) are rooted in neoliberal philosophy so would be unable to solve the issues of fragility and financial crisis. On the basis of our analysis in these four chapters, two major conclusions are emphasized. Firstly, the financial markets should not be left to the vicissitudes of free markets, and a relevant regulatory framework having macroprudential orientations must be implemented to replace the dominant free-market-based approach. Analytical and policy insights (“big government” and “big central bank”) endorsed by heterodox economist Hyman Minsky seem appropriate to understand and constrain the fragility of capitalist market economies. Secondly, it is advisable for EMEs to adopt policies keeping in view their own macroeconomic characteristics and the level of financial development and not by the blind faith in market liberalisation or the neoliberal policy paradigm."
"Supply chain maturity development is a growing concern for companies operating in an environment that is changing profoundly and simultaneously in several areas. Teaming up with several initiatives proposed as standards, companies make some progress with difficulty. As part of a post-positivist paradigm, this research focuses on the design of a model, which assesses the maturity of several dimensions of the supply chain. These objectives have been achieved from a thorough review of the literature, but also from the realization of an empirical study. On the one hand, the concepts of supply chain, supply chain management, supply chain maturity, as well as related capacity were reviewed in depth.On the other hand, assessment reference models in logistics, operations management and supply chain management have been studied and compared to capabilities of supply chain maturity established. This led to the design of a model based on earlier ones to propose criteria that complement them. This model was validated with a sample of 115 respondents (Directors logistics, supply chain managers, etc.). The analysis of the data collected was based on structural equation models, namely PLS-PM (Partial Least Squares -Path Modeling). This analysis was preceded by univariate analysis and principal component analysis, showed convergent validity and discriminant validity of measurement scales, but also the existence of links with variable impact between dimensions and supply chain maturity. Results of this research show that maturity is mainly constituted by the operational and strategic dimensions, followed by informational, structural, organizational and human resourcesdimensions. The thesis establishes that the maturity level of risk and resilience, relational and sustainable development and social responsibility dimensions have the least impact on the structuring of the supply chain maturity. Once validated, the effective maturity of the firms in the sample was evaluated using the Importance/Maturity analysis. Results from this analysis show a strong supply chain maturity of the company in relation to strategic dimensions, structural, organizational, risk and resilience, which is not the case with respect to other dimensions, where the analysis has identified low average maturity. This suggests that companies focus their efforts on the operational, relational, informational aspects and those related to sustainable development and social responsibility."
"Climate change adaptation policies are the subject of this thesis. It has been showed that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992) and the response strategies construction are characteristic of a pollutionist approach. This approach led to envision the question of climate change as a classic pollution and environment issue. As a result, this approach has generated a double bias to the disadvantage of adaptation compared to mitigation policies: adaptation has been confined in a secondary and marginal role in climate policies structuring, and with an inoperative conceptual and methodological framework for its implementation. The thesis proposes a deconstruction of this climate change conceptualization. Moreover, the major limits that characterize mitigation policies call into question the predominance given to them in climate policies construction. The « pollutionist » approach deconstruction allows at first to show that adaptation policies definition and operationalization need to go beyond (i) the standard analytic framework of climate policies and, (ii) the climate change conceptualization as a classic pollution and environment management issue. The thesis then argues that adaptation has to be integrated in development promoting policies, which means that adaptation needs to be conceptualized no longer as an ad hoc management of pollution effects issue, but as a development issue. Whether in the proper context of adaptation policies, or more largely of climate policies, the thesis leaves open the questions of the viability, but also of the organization and financing modalities, of a climate regime which fits within development promoting."

"Industrial symbiosis (IS) is presented as an inter-firm organizational strategy with the aim of social innovation that targets material and energy flow optimization, but also structural sustainability. In this study, we present systems thinking and geographical proximity as the theoretical framework used to analyze industrial symbiosis through a methodology based on System Dynamics and the underpinning use of Causal Loop Diagrams, aiming to identify the main drivers and hindrances that reinforce or balance the industrial symbiosis’s sustainability. The understanding of industrial symbiosis is embedded in a theoretical framework that conceptualizes industry as a complex ecosystem in which qualitative and quantitative approaches can be integrated, if we use a methodology flexible enough to encompass the complexity of the stakeholder’s values and motivations in the same analysis. Furthermore, the methodology performs a comparative strength over descriptive statistical forecasting, because it is able to integrate social causal rationality when estimating attractiveness in a region or individual firm’s potential. The stakeholders’ influence becomes essential to the complex understanding of this institution, because by shaping individual behavior in a social context, industrial symbiosis provides a degree of cooperation in order to overcome social dilemmas for actors like the tension between efficiency/resilience, who cannot be achieved by their own. The proposed narrative encourages us to draw up scenarios, integrating variables from different motivational value in the industrial symbiosis. We use the Altamira and the Dunkirk case studies to explain the role of geographical systems analysis, identifying loops that reinforce or regulate the sustainability of industrial symbiosis, and three drivers: “Efficiency/Resilience dilemma”, “Industrial symbiosis governance”, and “The role of global recycling networks in the by-product valorization”. The social dimension integration in the analysis of a complex system is indeed applied to enhance the understanding of IS dynamics, but a great potential is foreseen for other micro-level social systems like for example urban metabolism dynamics or bio-economy."
"The transition to renewable energy involves two kinds of environmental concerns. First, fossil fuels are exhaustible and second, their use generates negative externalities through irreversible environmental damage. Furthermore, there are possible synergies between energy efficiency measures and renewable energy adoption in the sense that the former reduces the energy demand so that the latter can begin to cut future greenhouse gases emissions. The main objective of this dissertation is to analyze the optimal energy transition under certain and uncertain occurrence of environmental catastrophe and to determine incentive-based instruments at the household level in order to boost the energy transition. The dissertation consists of four chapters that independently present and discuss different issues of energy transition. The first chapter focuses on the optimal energy transition involving decisions about both renewable energy adoption and investment in energy saving technologies, when there is a certain pollution threshold that triggers the occurrence of environmental catastrophe. The second chapter investigates the optimal transition to renewable energy under uncertain occurrence of environmental catastrophe. The third chapter is devoted to understanding household behavior regarding energy transition. The fourth chapter explores the role of smart-grids in integrating intermittent renewable energy to facilitate the energy transition"
"A products-services system is an offer integrating products and services with the aim of bringing a strong added value to the needs of the clients. The development of such offers requires numerous capabilities, some being mastered by the company developing the offer, others being specific to the suppliers. To collaborate with them became crucial for the customer company to meet the needs of innovation, to be more reactive toward the evolution of markets and to optimize the cost, the quality and the development time of the offer. Such collaborations require to be carefully constructed, then managed, so that the development of the new offer is successful. The research project presented in this report, led during a thesis under a CIFRE contract with Schneider Electric, contributes to the implementation of successful customer-suppliers collaborations in development of products-services systems. The aim of this work was to formalize a process that would help the structuring of a collaboration, which would in turn support the teams in charge of leading collaborative projects with suppliers. The final result of our work is a co-development process integrating the managerial approach of the development of a new offer, with the relational dimension characterizing the way collaboration is lived on a daily basis. The engineered research approach has been followed in this project, which leans on seven case studies within Schneider Electric company and six others companies stemming from different branches of industry such armament, cosmetic or insurance. Numerous actors, working at the corporate level in companies and in development projects, have been mobilized in client companies as well as in suppliers companies. The co-development process we propose here is based on the life cycle of the collaboration and the life cycle of the products-services systems. On one hand, it describes the managerial activities and their sequencing, the roles and the responsibilities of functions involved in the project, and the links with the others processes of the company. This top-down approach allows understanding the customer-suppliers collaboration as a whole and to anticipate the activities to be led with the suppliers. On the other hand, this managerial approach has been enriched by the illustration of collaborative practices describing the interactions from day to day between customer and suppliers. This second approach, bottom-up type, highlights the relational dimension of the project. It characterizes the daily interactions between the participants and thus contributing to the creation of commitment and trust, to the alignment of the efforts, and to mutual learning: elements necessary to the success of the project. The originality of our work resides in the combination of these two approaches in the same process, a combination which allows understanding how the co-development of a new products-services system is performed between several companies on a daily basis."
"Aside from the human and managerial skills necessary to propel any business, the right Lean deployment can play a big role in reducing waste and maximizing efficiency. Capturing these benefits is highly dependent on adequate Lean techniques integration. One of the major hurdles companies face is the difficulty to choose the Lean tools that best fit their contexts and that are best tailored towards reaching their objectives. In this study, we proposed an HLA based Co-Simulation framework with a Java-based digital platform to allow different federates (discrete event simulations), representing the operational Lean tools, running simultaneously in parallel. Time management mechanisms of HLA are required for regulating the advancement of the federates during the simulation run. An example of an Aeronautic company is used to demonstrate the usefulness of this co-simulation framework. Six Lean configuration models are investigated under market fluctuation, demand diversification, and uncertainty of resources contexts compared with an actual model simulated as a Lean free scenario."
"Economic relations between the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) have been characterized by non-reciprocal preferential trade agreements. These trade agreements have been continuously criticized for being incompatible with WTO rules. In order to conform to the norms of international trade, the EU has required that its economic relations with the ACP states are governed by the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA), which are negotiated with three African Regional Economic Communities. After more than twelve years of negotiations, the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have signed the EPA with the EU, despite differing opinions on the real benefits that can be expected from such agreements. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the impact of the EPA on the economies of the ECOWAS (in terms of trade creation and diversion), in particular Burkina Faso. The study uses a modified version of the computable general equilibrium model developed in Decaluwé et al. (2013). The static baseline model is calibrated using a social accounting matrix (SAM) for Burkina Faso’s economy of 2012. Our results show that the APE give the EU a competitive advantage. Burkina Faso’s imports originating from the EU increase, manifesting trade diversion. The trade agreements have no significant effect on Burkina Faso’s exports to the EU or the ECOWAS. Furthermore, while the APE considerably improve population well-being, they do not lower poverty or social inequalities."
"In a context of population ageing, the number of people requiring long-term care (LTC) is expected to increase. This fast growing old-age population is mainly cared informally, either by family members or close relatives. This thesis aims at contributing to the existing knowledge about ageing and informal care. The first Chapter examines the relationship between longevity and income in European countries. In Chapter 2, we study the incentives of adult children to care their old-age parents. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 address, respectively, the consequences of the decision to care on both caregivers’ health as well as on the caregivers ‘ couple"
"Given the fragilities of a heterogenous monetary union and the inability of the single monetary policy to lean against the wind of national financial cycles, new policies to defend financial stability in the European Monetary Union (EMU) are of the upmost importance. In response global financial crisis, advanced economies have supplemented their policy arsenal with a macroprudential approach to financial regulation, the practice of using prudential regulation to protect the health of the financial system and the economy as a whole, rather than just the health of individual institutions. Policymakers have unambiguously placed the task of containing systemic financial risk on the shoulders of macroprudential policy, but the national heterogeneities that characterize the Euro area pose significant challenges. The purpose of this thesis dissertation is to enrich the debate surrounding Euro area macroprudential policy by exploring how macrofinancial and institutional heterogeneity can condition its proper conduct. Macroprudential policy is a popular subject in post-crisis macroeconomics, but analysis is often built on premises that fail to acknowledge the complexities inherent to its most basic concepts, such as financial stability itself. Rather than building ever-more complex models that aim to incorporate all the dimensions of the phenomenon, the problem can be addressed by conducting a critical reflection on the field’s conceptual bases before formulating a model’s assumptions. In the first chapter, we conduct a critical review of the literature and identify several points of tension, interpreting their implications for the Euro area case. Based on the insights of chapter I, chapter II revisits the question of whether it is ideal for regulators to keep a narrow focus on national financial stabilization in the presence of cross-border spillovers, as is currently done. To do so, we build a static two-country New-Keynesian model where countercyclical capital regulation in the core affects financial stability in the periphery through the interbank market. By comparing national stabilization rules to a regime where the core regulator internalizes the spillover, we identify scenarios where the status quo is suboptimal. Finally, chapter III examines the significant institutional differences that exist among EMU national regulators. By reviewing official information , as well as assessment reports from the IMF and the FSB; we map the qualitative differences of national governance frameworks across six dimensions: presence of coordination mechanisms, completeness of instruments, independence, decision-making expeditiousness, strength of the legal mandate, use of communication and transparency. Given that institutional characteristics influence reactivity, we aim to quantify how this institutional heterogeneity affects the vulnerability to inaction bias through a comparative synthetic index. We find that countries are unequally protected against inaction bias, but there are several possible approaches to building robust governance frameworks."
"Coastal and marine ecosystems are some of the most heavily exploited with increasing degradation. This alarming situation appeals for urgent and effective actions. The optimal balance between use and conservation of ecosystems theoretically requires all costs and benefits to be considered in decision-making, including intangible costs and benefits such as non-market use and non-use values. The broad aim of this PhD is to examine how these economic values associated with coastal and marine ecosystem services can be measured, and how the economic valuation exercise may be considered and influence management decision- making.The first analytical part of the thesis focuses on assessing non-market use and non-use values, through econometric methods. The characterization and estimation of non-use values are complex and controversial, especially when the valuation exercise is focusing on individuals who are users of the ecosystem services being considered. An original approach based on a stated preference method, namely choice experiments, is developed then empirically applied in quantifying non-market values for marine and coastal ecosystems in two areas in New Caledonia. It allows the estimation of non-use values for populations of users in an implicit way. An in-depth analysis of the individuals’ choice heuristics during the valuation exercise is also conducted, with a focus on payment non-attendance. This issue is dealt with by comparing multiple modelling approaches in terms of: (1) inferred attendance, in relation to stated attendance; (2) attendance distribution according to several socio-economic variables; and (3) welfare estimates.After noting that the potential influence of economic valuation in decision making is unclear and largely unexplored in the literature, the second major component of this PhD aims to examine if, how and to what extent the economic valuation of ecosystem services, including measures of non-market values, influence decision-making regarding coastal and marine ecosystems management in Australia. Based on two nation-wide surveys, the perceived usefulness of the economic valuation of ecosystem services by the general public and decision-makers is studied, and the reasons why decision-makers may or may not fully consider economic values are elicited. Using a multi-criteria analysis, a part of the surveys also aims at examining the relative importance of different evaluation criteria (ecological, social and economic) when assessing the consequences of a hypothetical coastal development project on commercial activities, recreational activities and marine biodiversity."
"The aim of this research is to test the relevance of underdevelopment trap concept, by showing through the economic performance, that the policy of disinflation has installed the Moroccan economy in a low balance. The purpose is to highlight the restrictive effects on the growth and employment, the orientation of monetary and fiscal policy. The proposed conceptual framework derives from the debates related to the rule versus discretion, independence and credibility of the Central Bank, fiscal sustainability and a cooperative policy mix. The evaluation of the policy mix implemented with rigor since 1998 is based on the articulation of analytical frameworks from the theories of the economic policy, the economy of the endogenous growth and analysis in terms of capabilities of Amartya Sen. Two lines of thought have been developed. The first one involves the incorporation of the concept of underdevelopment trap to the sluggish growth thus constituting, the main characteristics of the system of growth in presenting the constraints on the economy. The second puts the evaluation of the welfare on the opportunities and freedoms offered by public policies. In this sense, it is necessary to analyze the inferences that exist between the economic policy, social welfare and the capabilities. These analyzes have mobilized multiple empirical data in order to assess the contradictory factors that prevent the economic activity from achieving its potential growth. Thus, the first five chapters of the thesis deals with theoretical foundations and the underlying mechanisms that guided the policy makers in the choice of its economic policy. The fixed rules in regard to inflation and the limitation of public deficit, the coordination of monetary setting and for the management of public finances, the independence of the Central Bank, the structural reforms as well as the priority given to macroeconomic stability, attest and endorse the neoclassical foundations of the economic policy. Seeking monetary credibility through the fixed rule of 2% inflation led to an increase in the cost of credit. Indeed, maintaining high interest rates is counter to the interests of SMEs which are penalized by the rationing the amount of credit that they are the subject. In budgetary matters, reducing the deficit to 3% constitutes a rule that ensures the control of public finances and supports the issuing institute in its fight against inflation. The imperative respect for this rule, regardless of the adverse shocks that affect the economy, maintains the factors of blocking linked to the decline in demand and the global income. Public Decision makers are thus deprived the shares of redistribution and to regulate their situation likely to limit social disparities. The strict policy limits the guarantee of rights and freedom because of its resulting social costs. Youth unemployment, the difficulties of access to goods and basic facilities, poverty, underemployment and illiteracy are a lack of freedom and rights that restricts the range of choice and achievements. The growth deficit feeds the social deficit and the extent of inequality strengthens it. It appears, eventually, that the choice of the strict policy focused on inflexible rules ensures, certainly achieved the objective of macroeconomic stability, but at the cost  of low growth and welfare. The effects of the financial crisis on the economy just confirm the fragility of the system of growth. The latter has channelled through the effects of income related to the decline in external demand through four channels of transmission: tourism, exports, and transfers from Moroccan living abroad and the IED. The rate of growth recorded between 2008 and 2010 remained low and employment declined. The impact of the crisis puts an end to the illusion of resilience of the economy and draws the attention to the fact that there is an alternative policy focused on growth and employment."
"The global financial crisis in 2008 has highlighted the failure of traditional banking regulations and forced developing countries not only to reinforce existing regulations but also to search for new ways of stabilizing banks. In particular, it became evident that classical prudential regulations can be more efficient if it is complemented for example by good corporate governance, market discipline and efficient procedures for the handling of failed banks by the regulator. In this thesis, we try to identify the efficiency of these different dimensions of bank regulations for the particularly interesting case of Vietnam. After the government’s decision of reform (“doi moi”) in 1986, the country has succeeded in the gradual privatization of different economic sectors, including banking and finance, leading to a more prosperous economy and better living conditions. However, when looking closer at this process, it is possible to identify a number of problems in the financial sector that threaten to slow down economic growth. If Vietnam is to keep growing and catch up with more developed economies, it is essential to understand the root causes of these problems and address them with better financial regulations. We believe that our results will be a step in this direction. We also think that many of our insights should be transferrable to other emerging and transition countries. More generally, Vietnam can also be used as a laboratory to better understand the economic mechanisms that exist in developed countries."
"Investors can use segment information in order forecast risk and return of diversified and/or multinational firms. This thesis contributes to develop and improve this information use on a financial point of view. The quality and the form of the segment information disclosed by a firm depend on some characteristics of this firm : diversification, internal organization (organizational structure, vertical integration), outline (size, capital market activity, minority interest, leverage, political sensitivity and return on investment of its industries) and the data availability. This thesis proposes a general frame of the use of this information depending on the approach of the users and the quality of this information. Furthermore, this thesis proposes an application of this use in a mechanical model of earning forecasts. These theoretical propositions are tested in four empirical studies. Two of them are international ones. "
"This thesis focuses on the concept of social entrepreneurship, which combines an economic project and a social purpose. During the early stages of project development, social startups often face challenges in their business model (BM) due to organizational constraints, but also threats and opportunities of their environment. Our goal in this research is to identify the mechanisms that allow to reconcile the 'economic' and 'social' through the following issue: How to keep balance between the economic and the social dimension of social enterprise's BM in the face of its environment? Thus, we have mobilized a mixed approach (content and process) to study the evolution of the BM of social startups. This has allowed us to meet the ancillary issues of the 'why' and 'how' as well as the ""what"" of the evolution of the BM of social enterprises. To answer our research question, we have adopted a qualitative approach by conducting a comparative study of social startups of ICT (information and communication technologies) in France and Senegal. Fifty five (55) in-depth interviews supplemented with secondary data (websites, internal documents, reports, etc.) was analyzed thanks to the assistance of the software Nvivo 11. As regards our results : first, our research enriches the literature of new internal and external factors that influence the evolution of the BM like fundraising, grants, the increase of the social impact and financial independence. Second, we have identified the elements of the BM that change with the startups development phases, as well as their logical evolution. On the other hand, our main contribution remains on the identification of main mechanisms that can allow to keep a good balance between the economic dimension and the social dimension of the BM when the latter evolves. Finally, our results show the differences and similarities in the evolution of the BM between the Senegal and France thanks to their entrepreneurial ecosystem."
"In 2010, 1,500 Chief Executive Officers identified managers' creativity as the most crucial factor for future organizational success. However, managers' engagement in creative actions is constantly competing with routine behaviors that imply less risk taking, uncertainty and possibility of failure. This dissertation explores three potential avenues to understand managers' decisions  to engage in creative actions. The first one focuses on managers' conceptions of creativity and innovation as antecedents of their own creative behaviors and their evaluation of creative managers and managerial practices. The second avenue examines how creative actions result from a decision-making process that evaluates the relevance of creativity in specific situations and takes into account individual predispositions and organizational characteristics. The third avenue investigates the extent to which a fit or misfit between managers and their organizations can trigger creative behaviors. This research reaffirms the relevance of the multivariate and interactionnist approaches to organizational creativity. It highlights also the importance of considering managers' evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of specific creative actions in specific situations. Finally, most research tends to conceive that managerial creativity emerges from positive and encouraging circumstances. In contrast, the present research highlights that managerial creativity can emerge as a response to situations of misfit and dissatisfaction."
"Lebanon knows nowadays a phenomenon against original-urban migration, while growing urbanization is rather the great feature of our world today. This has piqued our curiosity led us to investigate the causes of this dynamic in some Lebanese areas while others remain outside and suffer from underdevelopment. Such is the case of the region that is the subject of our research: Akkar, north Lebanon.To boost the region and trigger a process of territorial development, it is clear that agriculture must be aware of the concerns of the center of its predominance in the territory of Akkar and comparative advantages it provides.Several theoretical and empirical work highlights the virtues of the development of agriculture in terms of GDP growth and the fight against poverty and show that agriculture reacts faster than other sectors to new policies and contributes greatly to the GDP. Agricultural growth stimulates the whole economy because it creates markets for non-agricultural goods and services, producing a diversification effect of the economic base of rural areas. Thus the food industry and tourism will develop in line with a new vision for agriculture.Finally, the current weaknesses of Akkar economy can become opportunities if the multifunctional nature of the rural economy is sustainable development from a dynamic encompassing agriculture, agribusiness and tourism. Shares on the conditions of production (improving infrastructure, strengthening education and training, financial support and rational organization of production) involve state support. The actions of revitalization and recovery through a series of local development projects involve for their strong mobilization of local actors and decentralized for greater flexibility, especially in the management of decentralized cooperation projects."
"For about half a century we have witnessed an integration of the concept of territory in the analysis of economic development in less developed countries as well as in developed ones. The new approach considers the territory as an actor of development and not merely as a spatial frame for the economic activity. It is based on the observation that development must be carried out as close as possible to the local actors who value the resources (generic and specific) available on the territory by a technical-economic dynamic of production ensuring its competitiveness and a socio-institutional dynamic of regulation guaranteeing its sustainability. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding and improvement of this new approach of development.With a deep consideration of the Bekaa (a peripheral territory - in the geographical and economic sense - of Lebanon), we try to demonstrate that in the context of an economic structure generating sectoral and spatial imbalances and social disparities, the notion of territorial development and the concepts associated with it (territorial economic system, territorial organization, local regulation, collective efficiency ...) constitute an appropriate framework of analysis and can be an effective tool for a development policy on the local level. Our analysis attempts to show that within the Bekaa agricultural cluster develops a territorial economic system structured around the wine industry, generating a territorial socio-economic dynamic capable of improving the living conditions of the local community. Although it is anchored in the territory of the Bekaa, wine activity is far from developing in autarchy. It constantly seeks to be part of a globalized economy thanks to the international openness of local players. In the current context of globalization, this openness to the outside world, while offering important opportunities, simultaneously presents challenges on a competitive level. The Bekaa territorial economic system also faces other challenges arising from endogenous factors such as interactions between actors. Therefore, it is essential to set up territorial governance that can regulate inter-actors’ relations and develop collective strategies for territorial promotion."
"Drawing on relational demography, leader-member exchange, and transformational leadership, this dissertation examines the impact of age diversity on the quality of manager-employee work interactions, transformational leadership behaviors, job satisfaction, and affective commitment in two high-tech French organizations. Age diversity is herein considered in terms of differences, similarities, and interaction terms between chronological and subjective dimensions of age. This research posits that age diversity between managers and their dyadic collaborators is paramount for the quality of their daily work interactions, for transformational leadership behaviors, impacting as well on their job satisfaction and organizational affective commitment. Our findings show that chronological age, subjective age as well as their interaction terms play an important role in the perceptions about the quality of work exchanges between managers and their direct reports, depending on whether the managers are younger or older than the employees. In addition, this research shows that age diversity may facilitate managers to display transformational leadership behaviors. On the one hand, our findings suggest that the greater the (chronological or subjective) age differences between older managers and their younger reports, the more likely are the managers to display transformational leadership behaviors. On the other hand, when the managers are younger than the employees, they are less likely to display transformational leadership behaviors at the workplace. Moreover, the greater the age distance between younger managers and older reports, the less likely is for the employees to perceive their younger superiors as able to display transformational leadership. Our results highlight also that the LMX interactions mediate the relationship between age diversity and job satisfaction especially when managers are older than their dyadic partners. Furthermore, this study underscores a number of positive direct effects of managers' and employees' ages on the job satisfaction and organizational affective commitment, depending on whether managers are younger or older than their collaborators. This work highlights the importance of further research on the role and meaning individuals assign to age, on the one hand, and the need for a closer examination of its complex effects on work attitudes and behaviors, on the other hand. In terms of practical and managerial implications, these findings may help managerial practice in the organizations comprising work teams whereby chronologically / subjectively younger managers and older employees or vice versa collaborate daily. As for research implications, this dissertation emphasizes the particular usefulness to simultaneously examine managers' and employees' ages for a more thorough understanding of their effects on organizational outcomes such as those presently studied."
"This thesis provides an empirical assessment of the impact of migrants' remittances on economic development of their origin country of origin. It shows that this impact, assumed in the literature as generally positive, is likely to be reduced due to the existence of a ""dependency effect"". This effect is particularly important in countries where remittances are an important share of GDP. This demonstration takes place in three stages: The first chapter provides a literature survey on the main determinants and impacts of remittances. Remittances are determined by individual behaviours, whose effects are observable at the macro level. The low volatility and the cyclical nature of remittances give them a stabilizing effect on receiving economies. This positive effect has nevertheless a setback: the remittances receiving countries can be subject to a dependency effect, resulting in a decrease in economic activity. The second chapter presents two results: First, it proposes the establishment of an empirical threshold of remittances' dependency. Thus, a country heavily dependent is characterized by a remittances to GDP ratio above the average of developing countries. The second result is the confirmation of a negative impact of this dependency according to the results of a panel data analysis on 32 countries. The results refute the hypothesis of a consistently positive impact of remittances on GDP growth and on gross capital formation (GFCF). The third chapter examines the impact and determinants of TFM in the case of a country heavily dependent: Tajikistan. This case study provides further analysis of the economics of remittances. Different macroeconomic determinants are tested to compare the role of Russian and Tajik economic activities on remittances. The results, robust to different estimation methods, confirm the effect of dependency. Moreover, remittances are more determined by Russian economic activity than by the Tajik one."
"This thesis addresses the problem of territorial development in rural touristic areas and the role of social capital to support this development. The theoretical framework of this research is illustrated by the study of two touristic territories in Lebanon: Aley and Mzaar, which exist in rural mountainous regions. The main goal of this study was to examine the effect of social capital on territorial development as well as on the living standards of the inhabitants of touristic territories. For this purpose, we first constructed a statistical model that represents the relationship between the different forms of social capital and the living standards of individuals. And second, we compared the levels of tourism development between the two territories with the levels of social capital they possess, this comparison allowed us to build a conclusion about the effect of social capital on the development of tourism at territorial levels. Our analysis of the effect of social capital on development differentiates its structural forms (bonding, bridging and linking) from its functional forms (citizenship and trust). The purpose of this decomposition is to find out if it is precisely the structural forms of social capital (networks in these forms) that explain this difference in development, or whether it is the functional aspects that affect more strongly the difference. In conclusion of this research, we propose a SWOT study that shows the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities and the threats of development in the territories of Mzaar and Aley. This analysis allows us to suggest some procedures that can be implemented as part of a development strategy for these two territories. These procedures aim to make use of the forces, to offset weaknesses, to avoid threats, and to seize opportunities. The added value of our work is that it goes beyond the study of social capital as a global concept; rather it seeks to explore the various components and forms of this capital and their impact on the level of development of touristic areas in Lebanon (a developing country). This allows us to find out if there is a difference in terms of the effect of social capital on development between poor countries such as Lebanon and rich countries like France and Italy."
"Our dissertation focuses on agency conflicts between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders that may arise following a merger-acquisition decision. Through three essays, we aim to identify cases in which the controlling shareholders use mergers and acquisitions as a tool to transfer wealth from minority shareholders to their own accounts. The first essay provides a theoretical analysis of this opportunistic behavior and examines two real cases. Using event study methodology, the second essay shows that the opportunistic behavior may be important in specific cases linked to the level of shareholder's entrenchment. Finally, the third essay shows that the acquisition premium may reflect this behavior even in cases of public transactions"
"How can a doctor become a doctor-manager? Can a doctor even become a doctor-manager? This dissertation aims at better understanding the phenomenon of transition from a regular doctor role to a doctor-manager role, a transition that is experienced as difficult in practice and theory. This phenomenon tends to be developed with the spread of performance management within European public organizations. This research draws upon the example of the clinical director role, a new role in French public hospitals that is mixing both medical and managerial responsibilities. This dissertation is based on three progressive studies. A first study examines this transition with a global view by analyzing the adjustments between a doctor and his/her new role. It is carried out through a case study within two health care organizations (a teaching hospital and a hospital) and through interviews with their 22 clinical directors. This study shows the importance of the individual dimension for the transition to succeed. A second study focuses on the influence of role identification on the way a doctor-manager role is enacted. A case study and interviews with 4 clinical directors and their main colleagues within a teaching hospital are used to reach this goal. This study reveals the customization effect of identification on a doctor-manager role. A third and last study deeply focuses on the identity work of doctors in their enactment of a doctor-manager role. We address this issue by using a case study with the same 4 clinical directors, but through direct observations of their behavior during meetings. This study shows the importance of activating of identity into the context to enact a doctor-manager role. Finally, our main argument in this dissertation is that a transition to a doctor-manager role can be lead through various adjustments and identification situations, as long as identity is reworked during role enactment. We suggest to hospital directors to give priority to the use of field management tools oriented on personalization, in order to help doctors understand the logic of their roles."
"This PhD-work aims at characterizing the regional HRM notion, then at understanding how it can be successfully built. This research relies on a theoretical framework built from the management tool and device literature (Hatchuel and Weil, 1992; Oiry, 2003) and from the “actor-network theory” (Akrich et al., 1988, 2006; Callon, 1986; Latour, 1992 This research relies on a multisite and longitudinal case-study realized between 2008 and 2010 and based on two distinct regional projects in France. Our analyses show that these regional HRM devices have been transformed over time. Our results further show that these devices were built differently in terms of “problematisation”, “interessement”, “enrollment” and “mobilization of allies”. In the first case, the translation process remains partial, while the second project produced a more complete translation process."
"In our modern societies, individuals' health and well-being is a major concern which elicits marketing academics' interest to health promotion research questions (Block and Keller, 1995; Cox and Cox, 2001; Keller et alii, 2003; Zhao and Pechman, 2007). Based on research studying communication's strategies that could induce behavioral change, this doctoral work aims at answering the following research question: how to improve health communications effectiveness? Using two experiments conducted during 2009 and 2010 in the United-States, this research studies two message's characteristics, the message frame (gains versus losses) and the communication's promoted objective (prevention versus detection). Results highlight that a gain-framed message produces a more favorable attitude toward the recommendation, a higher intention to follow it and higher intentions to converse and to look for information, results that are even truer when communication's objective is detection. This research brings a better comprehension of depth processes involved, showing that a loss-framed message induces a valence of mental imagery which is more negative than a gain-framed message and that the valence of mental imagery mediates the effect of message framing. This doctoral work brings theoretical contributions, which add to health communications literature as well as managerial contributions, which bring learning to health communications managers."
"The fight against educational inequality is one of the foundational principles of education in France. Implementing equal opportunity and the fight against social and geographical inequality are inscribed in the first article in the Code of Education. However, educational inequality persists and has continued to increase these past years. Using data sets from threedifferent international and national evaluations (PISA, Cedre, and TALIS), this dissertation seeks to bring a new perspective on the reduction of inequality for students enrolled in secondary education in France."
"Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are essential for industrial companies to automatize and monitor their business processes in order to boost their competitiveness. ERP systems are generic software designed to serve a large variety of companies with different business processes. Therefore, they have many configuration options to support various business processes used in different companies. The implementation process of an ERP system consists in assigning values to ERP parameters according to the company requirements: It determines the exact operations and processes supported by the system in the specific company. Infologic is a French company that develops and integrates their own ERP system called Copilote. It has thousands of parameters that are used to adapt it as precisely as possible to customer requirements. However, this flexibility makes the implementation of Copilote a time consuming task that requires a deep knowledge of its functionalities and parameters. Reducing the complexity of the implementation of Copilote is a critical issue for Infologic who needs to integrate efficiently new system integrators to meet the demand of new customers. In this thesis, we study the implementation process of Copilote in order to understand the main issues encountered by Infologic. We propose a new approach for extracting a catalog of configuration parts from existing configurations of Copilote, and each configuration part is associated with the business requirement it fulfills in order to reuse it for next implementations of Copilote. To this aim, we propose to use constraint programming (CP) to easily integrate feedbacks of experts by means of new constraints or criteria. We introduce new CP models to solve conceptual clustering problems and a new global constraint for the exact cover problem with several propagation algorithms. We show it allows to model easily conceptual clustering problems and to solve it more efficiently thant existing delcarative approaches."
"Many companies have been created to satisfy a demand in sports activities. However the market launch of sports services became sometimes more complex with the marketing of more complete products : tourist products including even sometimes components of the business tourism. Among these producing small companies of sport, some go bankrupt, others survive, and others still develop. We thus wanted to understand, in the sector of sports and tourism, the determinants and the phases of the growth of these small companies. This research relies on two complementary disciplines : management sciences and sociology of organizations. In a qualitative approach, after an exploratory study, it was based on the monographic analysis of a small firm offering sports and tourism services. The results underline an internal growth and by the network of the studied small company, which is characterized in four phases. Through the follow-up of the innovations created or « being done », the analysis shows the capacity of a manager « to translate » the uncertainties of the sector and the interests of its company, inside as outside his company, by implementing a different « strategy » (not formalization - formalization of the relations). The growth of the company seems to result from the cooperation of the stakehorders to this positioning. "
"Drawing from existing literature on price endings and luxury pricing, this thesis highlights the paradox of adopting odd prices (i.e., prices just below a round number) in a luxury context, where, intuitively, prices should mostly be round numbers. Price endings practices are investigated in the product category of luxury women handbags. In a first empirical analysis, different types of price endings and the determinants of their use by pricing managers are identified. In a second part, the results of two experiments measure customers’ perceptions of different facets of luxury and overall perceived luxury itself. In the last part, a conjoint analysis reveals customers’ preferences for odd price endings. The findings of this thesis challenge previous research on price endings practices, in that they show that well-know low-price, low-quality, low-prestige connotations typical of odd prices in a non-luxury context, might not subsist in a luxury environment, at least for the handbag product category and for an intermediate level of luxury."
"This thesis aims to understand the sexual sense of bodybuilding for male heterosexual bodybuiders. Thanks to qualitative methodology, we figure out that a strong and significant link exists between the motive to enter the practice and the feeling of a weak gendered identity. Howerver such a link is evolutionary, in particular when the individuals strengthen their commitment in the “carreer” of bodybuilder. That doesn’t mean that the gendered identity issue disappears, because the sense given to the work in bodybuilding has ties with professional work wich also plays a role in the gendered interactions. Such a result is highly relevant, because it allows us to concluse that the main stakes relative to the gendered identity issue concern a competition between men and not directly between men and women.

"There is no controversy on the definition of public budget constraint. However, there is much debate on the speed of fiscal adjustment through which governments decide to satisfy their budget constraint : this is the topic of this PhD thesis.  The main assumption is that the speed of adjustment is critical in the comprehensive assessment of the fiscal policy. More specifically, I answer to the following three questions: (i) historically, how fast was the resorption of governments’ fiscal imbalances? (ii) What are the effects of different fiscal stimulus given the speed and the composition of the adjustment? (iii) How the length of an accommodative monetary policy affects the answers of the above questions? The first chapter shows that the weaknesses of econometric tests of sustainability can be overcome. I characterize the degree of persistence in fiscal imbalances by using fractional econometrics. This methodology allows to classify countries according to the reaction functions of their fiscal authorities. The chapter two assesses, through a general equilibrium model, the effects of adjustments after an expansive fiscal policy. I show that, whatever the preferred instrument for fiscal stimulus, an acceleration in the speed of adjustment has a negative effect on production in the medium term. Given that the nominal interest rate reached its lower bound, the chapter three assesses, in this context, a policy mix based on the timing of adjustments after the fiscal stimulus. An unstable regime of excessive consolidation occurs when the fiscal adjustment is strong regardless of the behavior of the central bank towards inflation."
"It is generally agreed that the severity of oil markets shocks tends to decrease as does dependence of developed economies on those shocks. Developed countries are generally energy importers, and the effect of oil market shocks on oil-exporting countries may be different, especially if energy represents a large percentage of the country’s exports. In addition, the focus on commodity exports may change the relative forecasting performance of econometric models that are generally used for forecasting. This thesis studies and develops models for structural analysis and short-term forecasting of an oil-exporting economy using Russian data for all empirical applications. The first chapter is devoted to a construction of a DSGE model for a country with commodity exports. The DSGE model is estimated by Bayesian methods We find that despite a strong impact of commodity export shocks on GDP, the business cycles in Russia are mostly domestically based.. The second chapter discusses how the Bayesian methods may be applied for forecasting with a BVAR model. The third chapter applies these techniques and compares the performance of a group of non-structural models – univariate and multivariate – for forecasting a set of Russian macroeconomic indicators. In the fourth chapter, the forecasting focuses on multivariate structural (DSGE) and non-structural BVAR models. The fifth chapter quantifies the effect of different types of oil market shocks on several Russian macroeconomic variables."
"This dissertation focuses on the issue of water infrastructure renewal in potable water distribution networks. I investigate the reasons why water infrastructure in certain water utilities are not renewed. This dissertation is divided into three chapters. The first chapter is based on theoretical models that solve for the optimal water main network quality index. The second chapter studies the optimal timing of water mains replacement. And finally, the third chapter is based on an empirical study on the factors that influence the water main replacement rates in French utilities.In the first chapter I present a static cost minimisation model to solve for the cost-efficient water main quality index. This quality index is defined as the proportion of ``new"" mains (which we denote as ''good quality mains'') to the total length of mains. The solution depends on the arbitrage between the cost of water loss and the cost of good quality mains. Where economies of network density are present such as urban utilities, water loss represents a cost burden to the water utility; hence water loss reduction (high network quality) is beneficial. Furthermore, we show that rural utilities face the largest difficulty in achieving both water loss reduction and cost recovery of network renewal.In the second chapter I present a two-stage optimal switching timing model that solves for the profit-maximising timing of water mains replacement. This model considers the option between rehabilitation and replacement. Water utilities may be inclined to rehabilitate old mains to extend their longevity since rehabilitation costs are much lower than replacement costs. We show that it is beneficial for the utilities to replace mains that are already obsolete than to rehabilitate since the generated benefit from temporary water loss reduction and the postponement of replacement is not worth the cost of rehabilitation. This is particularly noticeable in large urban utilities that face large costs of water loss.In the third chapter, I present an empirical study on the water mains replacement rates observed in French water utilities. The empirical results based on cross sectional data show that publicly operated utilities on average have higher replacement rates than outsourced utilities. This is because most of the public utilities have short total network length (very high replacement rates are associated with small network length). Moreover, small rural networks tend to conduct replacement of mains alongside other roadworks. However results also show that public utilities have higher replacement rates over outsourced ones in very large urban utilities. This result reflects the difference of priorities defined by in-house operated utilities and outsourced utilities. This difference does not imply that outsource utilities neglect network renewal; instead it reveals the nature of the structure of outsourced utilities. The responsibility of outsourced utilities are defined in the contract signed with the local authority. If network renewal is not specified, there is no incentive for replacing mains. Moreover, in practice, outsourced utilities often manifest higher prices which are accompanied by higher water quality. Furthermore, the results show that the size of the network has a large impact on replacement rates. The longer the length, the proportion of replaced mains are smaller; however, for very large utilities the negative effect disappears. The results show that replacement rates are indeed greater in very large urban utilities. This result is coherent with the theoretical models presented in the first chapter that shows the urgent need for high network quality in large urban utilities."
"The thesis consists of four chapters, which discuss the different aspects of macroeconomic policy elaboration under uncertainty.The first chapter is devoted to the robust monetary policy in a currency union. A great number of recent researches reveal the importance of country-specific shocks for the optimal policy in a currency union. However, these shocks have been completely overlooked by the literature on optimal policy under model uncertainty. Thus, the main purpose of this chapter is to fill this gap and to show that the asymmetries between regions have to be taken into account when elaborating robust monetary policy. In our research, we use a New-Keynesian model of a two-country currency union which is hit by asymmetric shocks. For this model, we derive the robust monetary policy which works reasonably well even for the worst-case model perturbations. We find the attenuation effect of uncertainty in case of shocks in a region with stronger price stickiness. This means that the central bank reacts to these shocks less aggressively when the extent of model uncertainty is higher. For the shocks in a region with more flexible prices, we find a anti-attenuation affect of model uncertainty.The second chapter discusses the optimal policy design in a game-theoretical framework. More precisely, this chapter explores the role of uncertain government preferences in a linear-quadratic model of fiscal and monetary policy interaction. We show that the effects of preference uncertainty are fastened on multiplicative uncertainty about the policy effectiveness. If the effects of fiscal and monetary policies on the economy are known, preference uncertainty does not alternate the symbiosis result of interaction. In this case, inflation and output are equal to their targets irrespective of the central bank and the government preferences. Multiplicative uncertainty about the fiscal policy effects creates the inflation bias. Multiplicative uncertainty about the monetary policy effects creates either standard inflation bias or negative inflation bias with output higher than the target and inflation lower than the target. In this case, preference uncertainty enlarges the absolute value of the output gap, while the effect on the inflation gap depends on the extent of monetary multiplicative uncertainty. After studying the impact of uncertainty on inflation and output gaps, we proceed with the welfare properties of the equilibrium and discuss the optimal conservativeness of authorities for different types of uncertainty.The third chapter explores the role of public and private information in heterogeneous societies. The literature which studies the impacts of information on social welfare, is extensive. Nevertheless, most of this literature is based on the assumption of homogeneous economy, meaning that all the agents are hit by the same fundamentals shocks. In this chapter we develop a two-region economy with idiosyncratic shocks. For this model, we derive the equilibrium, social and regional optimum and discuss the social, regional and inter-regional values of information. After that, we apply this methodology to a beauty contest example.The last chapter studies non-cooperative communication games being played by policymakers in an international economy. Each policymaker receives signals on the real idiosyncratic shocks which affect the country economies. It has the choice of revealing or not the received signals. The model is characterized by a beauty contest argument in the utility function and cross-border real spillovers. The non-cooperative equilibrium is never characterized by no revelation. A full transparency outcome may be the equilibrium outcome and is then Pareto-optimal. From a normative point of view, no revelation may be Pareto-optimal: the social value of public information may be negative in international economies as well as in closed economies. Partial revelation schemes are possible outcomes but never Pareto-optimal."
"Unemployment rates in developed economies are now significantly different. Labor market institutions are also diverse and multifaceted. These institutions could be considered as allowing to increase or to reduce the levels of unemployment. However empirically, there is no direct and unambiguous link between unemployment rates and institutions in the labor market. By considering more precisely the way in which firms decide on their payroll, we realize that we omit, by making this simple correlation link, an essential variable that determines the hiring and firing behavior of firms, namely the funding variable. The external financing capacity of firms may determine the labor demand, conditional on the institutions in the labor market. Thus, the problem is not whether institutions in the labor market condition its relative performance but rather whether the couple of institutions in labor and credit markets determines this performance. A firm is certainly constrained by a greater or lesser flexibility in the labor market, but its computations are part of a broader perspective, which is whether or not it has access to the funding it needs. The importance of financial frictions in the credit market determines the level of the external financing constraint for firms. This could then have an impact on their hiring plans and job levels in economies depending on the prevailing labor market institutions. Financial frictions should therefore influence the main labor market macroeconomic variables, namely unemployment, wage level and the number of vacancies, conditional on existing labor market institutions."
"This thesis frames players' activities in the gaming industry as labor. Based on various qualitative date (field studies, observation, case studies, video analysis, sectoral data), the thesis proposes that firms profitability in the gaming industry is based on the constitution and exploitation of a specific form of intangible capital coined as communitarian capital. The shift from a product to a service industry is described, putting the relationship between the firm and its users and between users themselves at the forefront of firms profit. The concept of community is heavily discussed. Using a framework based on the digital labor theory as well as economics of conventions, the hypothesis of players' labor is formulated. Because players' interactions is so crucial to understanding contemporary business models in the gaming industry, the thesis integrates theses interactions as part of the value production process. The devices used by firms to extract value from players are thoroughly investigated during a long-term field study in a leading french firm of the sector. The thesis concludes by analyzing the case of the Twitch platform, on which some players professionaze and gain revenues by constituting and managing their own communities. The communitarian capital framework this thesis proposes can be applied beyond the case of the gaming industry, and aims at understanding mutations linked to the digital economy, both concerning labor and capital."
"This work analyzes the transformations in the division of intellectual labor in social science by considering the study of economic facts within the Sixth Section and the EHESS in the postwar era. Created with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation in 1947, the Sixth Section was meant to meet the need for economic expertise during reconstruction. First, “realistic economists”, then dominant within the institution, advocated a pluralistic approach to economic facts and used the methodology of other social sciences. Very quickly, however, this approach was considered too removed from the patrons’ concerns and the attempts to bring economists closer to political and economic powers failed in the mid-1950s. In addition, the reorganization of the scientific agenda of the Sixth Section around the so-called “areas study program” promoted other approaches to economic facts, in particular economic history and economic anthropology, accentuating the decline of economics at EHESS. In the mid-1970s, however, the institution's new leadership helped the revival of economics around theoretical modeling. Based on international scientific standards, this approach estranged economists from other social science disciplines."
"This dissertation addresses the foundations of user’s behavior with respect to the congestion in public transport. It is made of three distinct essays. The two first essays investigate how users get used to lack of punctuality and crowding. The third essay presents an empirical analysis of the crowding effect. In the first chapter, I consider the modeling of a bi-modal competitive network involving a public transport mode, which may be unreliable, and an alternative mode. The public transport reliability set by the public transport firm at the competitive equilibrium increases with the alternative mode fare, via a demand effect. This is reminiscent of the Mohring Effect. The study of the optimal service quality shows that often, public transport reliability and thereby patronage are lower at equilibrium compared to first-best social optimum. In the second chapter, to study the behavioral implications and costs of crowding, I develop a structural model in which public transport users face a choice between traveling in a crowded train and arriving when they want, and traveling earlier or later to avoid crowding but arriving at an inconvenient time. I derive the user equilibrium and socially optimal distribution of passengers across trains, show how the optimum can be decentralized using train-specific fares, and characterize the welfare gains from optimal pricing. Properties of the model are compared with those obtained from the bottleneck and flow congestion models of road traffic. In the third chapter, I investigate the influence of in-vehicle crowding on the comfort satisfaction experienced during a public transport journey. Moreover, I describe the anatomy of the crowding effect by testing various nuisance factors (Smell, Noise, Standing...) as channels through which crowding may decrease the comfort satisfaction. I find a clear crowding effect: on average, an extra-user per square meter decreases by one the expected 0 to 10 scale individual well-being. I do not find any empirical evidence of this effect being intensified by the travel time. However, the crowding effect increases with the income of users. I find three causes of crowding disutility: a higher probability to stand for all or part of the journey, a poorer use of the time during the journey, and noisier travel conditions. These features of discomfort matter more for women and wealthy individuals."
"This PhD thesis consists of three chapters.The first chapter deals with urbanization. A brief history and forecast of cities are highlighted. This overview explains current and upcoming issues in cities, such as congestion, air pollution, urban sprawl, etc. Urban sprawl, among other things, accentuates the question of how to finance network infrastructures such as telecommunications networks at the local loop level in sparsely populated areas. Specific urban policies can be transposed to telecommunications. Some lessons are valuable to regulate this sector.The second chapter is focuses on funding new telecommunications networks. Three articles are put forth. In the first one, it is shown that the credible threat of a State-owned network can be an incentive for private players to invest in a next-generation access. This incentive regulation, however, does not suffice. It should be accompanied by dedicated access regulation. In the second article, it is shown that the regulated access price must include a risk premium to compensate the incumbent for the investment risk of asymmetric regulation. The proposed theoretical framework applies to the Qatari fixed market. Finally, in the third article, a new regulatory approach is put forth to address the issue of Net Neutrality, in particular, regulatory holidays of Net Neutrality rules can be relevant. This innovative approach would allow an Internet Service Provider, to sell, for a given time period, additional bandwidth to content and service providers. At the end of the period, additional bandwidth could be re-allocated to the Open Internet that functions under the Best-Effort regime. Hence, it is shown that this regulatory approach could be an incentive for Internet service providers to invest in more bandwidth but it would also guarantee, in the long run, a given level of quality of service for Internet services.The third chapter deals with the effect of ad blocking on the Internet. The proposed theoretical model highlights the opposite effects of ad blocking on telecommunications networks: on the one hand, ad blocking reduces network congestion, on the other hand, ad blocking increases available content diversity over the Internet. In consequence, Internet service providers have an incentive to integrate an ad blocker, which can be welfare enhancing under certain specific conditions."
"Dans les pays de l’OCDE, le vieillissement démographique et la prévalence croissante de maladies chroniques induisent un accroissement marqué des effectifs de personnes âgées dépendantes. Répondre à la préoccupation sociétale concernant l’accompagnement des personnes en incapacité dans un contexte de pression sur les finances publiques constitue un défi majeur pour les politiques publiques. Comment les dispositifs publics visant à financer les soins de longue durée affectent les aides formelles et informelles reçues par les personnes en situation d’incapacité ? La distribution des aides médico-sociales et des restes-à-charge est-elle équitable ? Comment améliorer l’efficience et l’équité des dispositifs publics ? Cette thèse apporte un éclairage sur ces questions en mobilisant les outils conceptuels de la microéconomie et les méthodes de l’économie appliquée. Elle rassemble quatre investigations empiriques menées à partir de données françaises et néerlandaises récentes. Les 3 premiers chapitres traitent du cas français. Le chapitre 1 étudie la distinction faite entre adultes handicapés et personnes âgées dépendantes. Il évalue l’effet de la « barrière des 60 ans » sur les aides formelles et informelles reçues. Les chapitres 2 et 3 se focalisent sur le dispositif-phare destiné aux personnes âgées dépendantes, l’Allocation personnalisée d’autonomie (APA). Le chapitre 2 estime les élasticités prix et revenu de la demande d’aide à domicile des bénéficiaires de l’APA. Le chapitre 3 évalue l’équité dans l’utilisation des aides et des restes-à-charge dans le cadre de l’APA. Le chapitre 4 évalue l’équité horizontale dans l’utilisation de soins de longue durée aux Pays-Bas. Les subventions sur l’aide à domicile induisent des ajustements dans la consommation d’aide via des effets de revenu et de substitution, ce qui a des implications pour l’efficience de ces dispositifs. Des iniquités sont détectées dans les deux pays.In OECD countries, population ageing and the increasing prevalence of some chronic diseases cause a substantial increase in the number of the disabled elderly. Responding to both the societal concern for ensuring appropriate longterm care (LTC) to the disabled and the pressure on public spending is a major challenge for public policies. How do public LTC schemes affect the use of formal and informal care by the disabled? Are there socio-economic disparities in the use of formal care? Is the allocation of LTC services and of the out-of-pocket payments incurred by the disabled elderly equitable? Which features of LTC policies could be changed to make them more efficient and more equitable? My research sheds light on these questions, using conceptual tools from microeconomics and methods in applied economics. It brings together four empirical investigations led in the contexts of France and the Netherlands, which have contrasting LTC systems. I make use of recent administrative and survey microdata. The first three Chapters focus on French policies. Chapter 1 studies the distinction that is made between the handicapped adults and the dependent elderly in access to public LTC support. It assesses the effect of the “age 60 threshold” on the formal and informal care received by individuals with a disability. Chapters 2 and 3 concentrate on the main scheme accessible to the disabled elderly, the Allocation personnalisée d’autonomie (APA). Chapter 2 estimates the income and price elasticities of formal home care demand by APA beneficiaries. Chapter 3 assesses equity in the use and financing of home care within the APA scheme. Chapter 4 lands in the Netherlands and assesses income-related horizontal equity in LTC use. Home care subsidies trigger adjustments in the use of care through both substitution and income effects. This has implications for the efficiency of such policies. Some inequity is detected in both countries."
"Production Management is concerned with a class of decisions to be made in a manufacturing firm in order to gear it towards its objective. Since this decision making problem is very large, it must be approached hierarchically. Hierarchical production management systems are characterized by several decision levels operating in a coordinated fashion. Designing such systems means defining the models to be used at each level (entities, objective, horizon), and a coordination procedure. The models studied in this work are devised for the higher levels of a hierarchy ; the production system is represented as a network of subsystems with limited capacity and the objective sought is to minimize the flow time of product families. It is proved that under certain assumptions concerning the inventory holding costs, a very simple algorithm exists to solve this deterministic optimization problem. It is then shown that it is possible to relax this assumption by using dynamic programming but the amount of computations required increases dramatically"
"Estimation of structural demand models in differentiated product markets plays an important role in economics. It allows to better understand consumers’ choices and, amongst other, to assess the effects of mergers, new products, and changes in regulation. The standard approach consists in specifying a utility model, typically an additive random utility model, computing its demands, and inverting them to obtain inverse demand equations, which will serve as a basis for estimation. However, since these inverse demands have generally no closed form, estimation requires numerical inversion and non-linear optimization, which can be painful and time-consuming. This dissertation adopts a different approach, developing novel inverse demand models, which are consistent with a utility model of heterogeneous consumers. This approach allows to accommodate rich substitution patterns thanks to simple linear regressions with data on market shares, prices and product characteristics. The first chapter of this dissertation develops the inverse product differentiation logit (IPDL) model, which generalizes the nested logit models to allow for richer substitution patterns, including complementarity. It also shows that the IPDL model belongs to the class of generalized inverse logit (GIL) models, which includes a vast majority of additive random utility models that have been used for demand estimation purposes. The second chapter develops the flexible inverse logit (FIL) model, a GIL model that uses a flexible nesting structure with a nest for each pair of products. It shows that the FIL model, projected into product characteristics space, makes the price elasticities depending on product characteristics directly and, using Monte Carlo simulations, that it is able to mimic those from the ""flexible"" random coefficient logit model. The third chapter studies the micro-foundation of the GIL model. It shows that the restrictions that the GIL model imposes on the inverse demand function are necessary and sufficient for consistency with a model of heterogeneous and utility-maximizing consumers, called perturbed utility model. It also shows that any GIL model yields a demand function that satisfies a slight variant of the Daly-Zachary conditions, which allows to combine substitutability and complementarity in demand."
"Most of the emerging countries have experienced severe banking crises over the centuries which require them now to pay more attention. These countries are characterized by underdeveloped financial markets, increased opacity in fragile banking systems, a huge amount of bad and doubtful debts, and sometimes an inadequate legal, institutional and regulatory environment. This rises up the question of the role of banking regulation as an essential mechanism needed to prevent systemic risk, and to avoid the negative consequences of maintaining a financial stability. Seeking the answer for the latter question, we study here the causes and factors that explain well the fragility of the banking system in emerging countries, including a literature study on the theoretical foundations of the banking crisis, and the evolution of banking regulation. Moreover, a study on the effects of regulatory framework, and oversee of the banking crises probability in emerging markets is presented. Later, we perform a descriptive analysis of the specific regulatory and supervision of banking systems in emerging countries. This includes 21 countries from Europe East and Central, South Asia, and North Africa. Finally, we introduce a new logit model to determine the predictions of supervision and regulation that explain most of the banking crises in the presented countries."
"The rapidly increasing demand for health care in the province of Ontario has led to greater numbers of patients turning to Emergency Departments of public hospitals for the care they need. Management quality of Emergency Departments measured by patient outcomes is likely symptomatic of management quality of the hospital and ultimately that of the hospital board. This study is a first to our knowledge in connecting the management quality with board composition of hospitals. Performance was assessed by ascertaining which activities were present then the performance of those activities, in terms of patient outcomes, was assessed. Data was collected from the Ministry of Health of Ontario reporting all 109 hospitals over 3 years and from the histories of board members. The effect of activities on patient outcomes was evaluated with activities having a positive effect on patient outcomes classified as critical activities. Performance of critical activities was compared with board composition and skills. 3 links were found between boards and performance, boards with members having operational turnaround skill competencies had superior performance, boards with entrepreneurs and medical staff had a positive effect, and boards with politicians had a negative impact on performance. Therefore boards of hospitals in Ontario should be constructed so that members can provide superior governance leading to better patient outcomes. This study revealed both activities which had no or negative impact and the absence of proven best practice activities. This is an issue of quality of management as board competency can be assessed by activity presence and the performance of those activities."

"This thesis in international political economy analyses factors influencing the decision-taking focusing on the trajectories of policy-makers across 4 chapters. The first chapter shows that the IMF’s Executive Board (EB) members have a considerable advantage on other IMF members in terms of loans and repayments through informal networks developed by their simple presence on the IMF’s EB at Washington DC. The second chapter focuses on the IMF’s EB career trajectories before and after their position, and how these trajectories influence loans and repayment modalities of borrowing countries. In a third chapter, we want to know in what extend central bankers’ recession experiences tend to lead them to decrease the interest rates of central banks. Finally, the fourth chapter proposes a model of political economy of reforms showing the importance of unions and transfers from governments to populations concerning the implementation of reforms in OECD countries. This thesis shows that, as national policy-makers which tend to directly influence the economic life, international policy-makers, through their stories, identities and life experiences, can also influence the economic sphere of countries."
"“Low cost” is nowadays a very mobilized concept in innovation and new product development both in the general press and in the scientific literature. In management sciences, theconcept is widely mobilized in strategy, marketing as well as new product development. However, there seems to be a lack of a design model for such an approach, making difficult for managers to implement the development of low cost offers. Our work shows that existent low cost products had followed different design rules that could be modelled. We propose a low cost design model that distinguishes two approaches: low cost adaptation and smart low cost design. In low cost adaptation approach, the product is designed through a “no-frills” approach to a regular product: the aim here is to reduce the performance of the existent product on secondary needs to reduce the reference cost. In the smart low cost design approach, a new solution is designed for an existing need with a cost goal. Thus, this specific design approach allows creating products with lower cost and higher value than regular products.Beyond the design rules of a product, we show the possibilities opened by smart low cost design to renew the dominant design through a longitudinal study done in the urban public transport sector. The case study underlined three main results: 1/ legitimization of a low cost adaptation needs a dual strategy that combines both approaches; 2/ the performance of low cost strategy relies on the strategy performance beyond products and its capacity to renew the public transport's dominant design; 3/ Low cost approach supports the dynamic capability for innovation when low cost is used as a tool to redefine the organizations' research and design space limits, as well as a tool to create new partnerships.Finally, the study of such industrial context, as a complex value network, underlined how low cost design help to overcome ecosystem barriers to innovation and propose new partnerships, leading firms to redesign and reconfigure their ecosystem and the value creation process."

"The housing market consists of two main segments, the rental market and the sales market. Although these two markets operate differently, prices on the two markets are naturally subject to reciprocal interactions: the level of rents affects prices of sale, but prices on the sales market have an impact on rents. On the first approach, the rents are convertible into a selling price by a capitalization formula. However it is empirically observed that imbalances exist between the two markets. Thus, the relative dynamics of both prices and rents can vary over time, and also in the space of an urban area. How are prices in the two markets (sale and rental) related? How does one affect the other? Is the relationship between the two prices homogeneous in space? Why is it that some neighborhoods of an agglomeration have rents that are too low in relation to purchase prices? These questions are of particular interest to local policy actors in housing, in a context of strong tensions on the housingmarket as is the case in the Lyon conurbation. In particular, they are strongly linked to policies aimed at supporting the supply of housing or the level of market rents. This thesis aims to study the link between these two markets.The first chapter of this thesis attempts to observe whether rent to price ratios vary within an urban area and seeks to explain the differences between rent to price ratios, if they exist. After recalculating the rent to price ratios in the agglomeration, we observe a spatial heterogeneity of them. In the second part of this contribution, we develop a ""tenure choice"" model that allows us to highlight theoretical mechanisms that explain spatial variations in the rent to price ratio.The second chapter of this thesis deals with the relationship between private housing market prices and the construction of social housing. In this first empirical contribution, we test the impact of the SRU law on house prices using a double-difference method. The results indicate that as the municipality’s delay in achieving the SRU's objectives increases, it leads to an increase in the construction of social housing and, ultimately, a decrease in the price of the municipality's private housing. We also use a discontinuity regression method using the 3500 population threshold. The results of this second analysis suggest that the construction of social housing has had a negative impact on private housing prices in municipalities with more than 3500 inhabitants.Today, there are several policies that encourage landlords to rent low-rent housing or that attempt to facilitate access to home ownership. Nevertheless, while these policies have already been studied, this third chapter attempts to understand their combined impacts on the private housing market. In particular, we try to show the impact of purchase and rental support policies and zero-interest loan policies. The first step in our contribution is to design a theoretical model. This theoretical modelhighlights the effects of each of the two mechanisms and also highlights the reaction of the housing market when each of the two mechanisms is coupled with a rent control policy. In an empirical analysis, we check whether the predictions of the previously developed model are valid. The results indicate that the impact of the reform on new housing prices is positive. The last step in our analysis is a triple-difference method that that the growth of new housing prices accelerates in the presence oftight rent controls."
"The traditional approach of the economics of prevention is built around a demand-side logic. This provides fruitful insights about consumer behaviour and public policies related to prevention, but it has nothing to say about the supply side of prevention. The present thesis aims at developing the economics of prevention from the supply-side, in particular the production of services by ambulatory physicians, and to study the incentives to prevention and the preferences of these medical care producers. An institutional analysis enables to underline the obstacles limiting the supply of prevention by French doctors, and shows that it is necessary to develop incentives mechanisms to increase this supply, particularly if a fee-for-service payment predominates in the remuneration of the doctor. The analysis of incentives to prevention reveals that a pay-for-performance payment is effective if subjected to conditions. It also demonstrates that incentives may not be exclusively of a monetary nature: non financial and organizational incentives are also efficient mechanisms. However, the efficiency of the various incentives depends on the motivations of doctors and on how they regard these incentive instruments. We empirically examine these perceptions by revealing the general practitioners’ preferences for the incentive mechanisms. An innovative approach of economic evaluation, namely a discrete choice experiment, is used in a survey. The econometric treatment of the collected data provides results which highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of the suppliers’ preferences. These results contribute to the reflection on the modelling of the behaviour of physicians and on the public policies designed to encourage the supply of prevention in medical care."
"During the recent years, african countries in the CFA zone have experienced many economic changes on the one hand through the measures initiated by bilateral and multilateral donors and on the other hand through the economic and monetary integration policies. Thus, relying on the assumption that because of these interventions, the economic systems incorporate various phenomena such as structural change and economic interdependencies, we studied their major implications on growth, convergence and growth predictability. Emphasis is first placed on the major features of integration policies in a monetary union, while stressing the possible implications of such policies on the economic dynamics of member countries mainly in terms of econometric modelling of growth and convergence. The different studies conducted on the basis of appropriate econometric tools led to new results concerning the process of growth and convergence of these economies compared to those based on standard tools of econometric modelling. It is also clear from this study that the presence of common factors and structural breaks is strongly linked to integration policies implemented in the CFA zone. These results also indicate that shocks produce heterogeneous effects on economies with various dates of occurrence and that it is necessary to vary the policy responses from one country to another for sustainable and shared growth."
"In the present doctoral thesis, we estimated Mincer’s (1974) semi logarithmic wage function for the French and Pakistani labour force data. This model is considered as a standard tool in order to estimate the relationship between earnings/wages and different contributory factors. Despite of its vide and extensive use, simple estimation of the Mincerian model is biased because of different econometric problems. The main sources of bias noted in the literature are endogeneity of schooling, measurement error, and sample selectivity. We have tackled the endogeneity and measurement error biases via instrumental variables two stage least squares approach for which we have proposed two new instrumental variables. The first instrumental variable is defined as ""the average years of schooling in the family of the concerned individual"" and the second instrumental variable is defined as ""the average years of schooling in the country, of particular age group, of particular gender, at the particular time when an individual had joined the labour force"". Schooling is found to be endogenous for the both countries. Comparing two said instruments we have selected second instrument to be more appropriate. We have applied the Heckman (1979) two-step procedure to eliminate possible sample selection bias which found to be significantly positive for the both countries which means that in the both countries, people who decided not to participate in labour force as wage worker would have earned less than participants if they had decided to work as wage earner. We have estimated a specification that tackled endogeneity and sample selectivity problems together as we found in respect to present literature relative scarcity of such studies all over the globe in general and absence of such studies for France and Pakistan, in particular. Differences in coefficients proved worth of such specification. We have also estimated model semi-parametrically, but contrary to general norm in the context of the Mincerian model, our semi-parametric estimation contained non-parametric component from first-stage schooling equation instead of non-parametric component from selection equation. For both countries, we have found parametric model to be more appropriate. We found errors to be heteroscedastic for the data from both countries and then applied adaptive estimation to control adverse effects of heteroscedasticity. Comparing simple and adaptive estimations, we prefer adaptive specification of parametric model for both countries. Finally, we have applied quantile regression on the selected model from mean regression. Quantile regression exposed that different explanatory factors influence differently in different parts of the wage distribution of the two countries. For both Pakistan and France, it would be the first study that corrected both sample selectivity and endogeneity in single specification in quantile regression framework"

"In front of the potential of social innovation to propose new entrepreneurial solutions to current social problems, the incubation approach has been promoted as a privileged method to stimulate and support its emergence. This research proposes to deepen our knowledge on social incubators and to explore the links between incubation and social innovation, as well as their effects. The analysis focuses primarily on the practices put in place during the promotion and incubation of social innovations. Three empirical studies have been conducted and each of them focuses on a specific dimension of the incubator’s work. The first article shows how social incubators work to legitimize social innovation as a new response to social needs, in their particular institutional contexts. On the basis of a comparative analysis of four pioneer incubators in Europe, the results show their key role as institutional entrepreneurs in promoting a discourse favorable to social innovation, in creating novel collaborations, and in attracting resources to the incubation process. The second article highlights the influence of incubation practices on shaping the social innovations and on drawing the tradeoffs between their social and economic goals. The in-depth qualitative analysis of the incubation process in a French incubator identifies three effects produced by these practices: the commodification of social problems, the entrepreneurialization of individuals, and the market-embedding of organizations. Finally, the third article focuses on the micro level of the incubator - entrepreneur interaction and focuses on observing the tensions at work in the construction of social innovations. The longitudinal study of the incubation process of three projects highlights the existence of a process aimed at creating entrepreneurial subjectivities. Moreover, it identifies certain conditions for a successful incubation. Overall, these results contribute to open the “black box” of social incubation and highlight the challenges raised in the process of promoting and supporting initiatives that pursue both social and economic goals."
"This dissertation explores the notion of environmental management accounting innovation and aims to explore how they are created, if they are adopted or not into companies and the consequences thereof, and finally how they are practiced. Research methods combine participant observation, semi-structured interviews and secondary data. This dissertation is composed of three articles that together explore the different facets of management accounting innovations. The first article tackles the question of how innovations get created and on their path to institutionalization. The focus is on the actors and their strategies, the who and how of the institutionalization process. Through an in-depth case study of one organization, the second article uncovers the process of the non-adoption of a carbon accounting methodology. The third article analyses the practices surrounding and accounting innovation in a multinational.Overall, this dissertation makes three main theoretical contributions on the specific institutional work developed by elite, the role of internal legitimacy in organizational legitimacy, and on the processes of co-emergence of new practices. This research on EMA innovations also contributes to further understanding how sustainable development can be pursued through accounting in organizations"
"Subjective knowledge refers to consumers’ perceptions about how knowledgeable they are in a specific domain. The present research investigates the impact of manipulating subjective knowledge on information processing and retrieval strategies. In a first study, we show that consumer self-esteem moderates the relationship between subjective knowledge manipulations and different measures of memory for new information. In a second study, we identify moderating mechanisms and boundary effects for the hypothesized effects. The third study specifies the scope of the memory effect. Finally, the fourth study extends the generalizability of the findings by adopting another subjective knowledge manipulation and covering a different domain of knowledge. Implications of these results are discussed and future tracks for research are provided"
"Management control is often accused of generating an imbalance of R&D efforts towards exploitation at the expense of exploration, thus compromising the sustainability of organizations. Solutions have been suggested to rectify this bias, through the development of measurement systems and the ambivalent use of available information. However they stumble on new challenges that accentuate even further the tensions that operational managers are facing. As part of this research, we conducted an exploratory case study within a large enterprise specialized in R&D to go back to the genuine sources of tension felt by those involved in its management. We were especially interested in better determining the impact of the role played by management controllers. We get the surprising conclusion that under certain conditions, the controllers can not only play very important roles in the management of research and development, but that these roles are growing in importance should the nature of said activities be more exploratory. Besides they relieve the tensions felt by operational managers in managing their activities"
"Having been hard criticized following the mishaps of « new economy », the sell-side analysts, salaried by the brokerage firms, represent necessary and inevitable actors however, both for management of firm and for investors and especially since the evolution of accounting regulation is being supposed to do answer their concerns. This research tries to understand how the sell-side analysts achieve their judgment. The first part of this thesis shows how the structuring of the previous researches, according to their apprehension of future, allows to construct a progress in the way the judgment of the analyst is studied by inserting progressively the social inscription of this last. This dimension acts then, as starting point for an understanding and qualitative step, founded on the method of Grounded Theory. The second party offers a model of analysis of the training of judgment as practice institutionally supervised and, on a local level, adjusted. This research shows how the inscription of the analyst how within its « organizational field » leads to have to take into account thinking-ways and to interact cognitively with other actors. The making of his judgment blends in then on a process of correlation between a qualitative and quantitative modelling, and an analysis in dynamics of Stock Exchange prices. This training of judgement also adjusts according to the degree of relational building in established by the analyst with his customers. "
"This thesis focuses on the emerging and structuring of the field of popular music in France, from the 1970s to the present day. A case study of eight nonprofit music venues is provided to document it. Using a neo-institutionalist framework and the concept of institutional entrepreneur, we demonstrate how founders and managers of nonprofit music venues have actively taken part in the constitution of this new organizational field. A three-step model is proposed, as well as an overview of social conditions enabling entrepreneurial endeavors. The research underlines a reciprocal influence between nonprofit entrepreneurs and government in shaping the field, and sheds new light on the institutional character of France’s “associations”. "
"This thesis qualitatively enquires about the relationship between management and creation. More precisely, its aim is too show how management tools are used and what their effects are on creation production and diffusion in organizations. Three longitudinal studies (a publishing company, an artist squat, a theatre) - three to nine years long with a weekly follow up – have shown that managers have to deal not only with paradoxes, but even also with contradictions between creation and management : uncertainties about the relevance of short and long term values, difficulties for assessment due to a fuzzy control of risks, a return on investment not only chancy but which may be realized by competitors. Management is no way neutral, by its very construction, it models an economic and social vision and has influence on creation. Yet creation, in order to get visible, needs a human reinforcement. Accounting language being in the heart of any decision, the administrator has the leading part in it. He is induced to consider many possible management forms. He becomes therefore a creation “spreader”. Such case studies required a specific course of action and writing in order to fit the subject. This case study derived its style from the narrative genre. It aimed to restore all the sensitivities and the participants multiple voices. Even if the decided upon style was not the only possible one, it offers the reader, nevertheless, a certain view respecting the words and actions of those we met with. Thus, it leaves the reader an open possibility to assess and discuss the telling. "
"-Exchange Rate Dynamics under Financial Market FrictionsThis paper extends Dornbusch's overshooting model by proposing “generalized interest parity condition”, which assumes sluggish adjustment on the asset market. The exchange rate model under the generalized interest parity condition is able to reproduce the delayed overshooting of nominal exchange rates and the hump-shaped response to monetary shocks of both nominal and real exchange rates.-Electoral Cycle of Exchange Rate in KoreaThis paper empirically investigates the real exchange rate behavior around elections in Korea. We find that the real exchange rate depreciates more before the elections but there is no clear pattern found  after the elections. Interestingly, this result is the opposite of the electoral cycle found in Latin American countries. To explain this results we should consider the difference between economic backgrounds of Korea and Latin American countries.-Exchange Rate Regime, Capital Market Openness and Monetary Policy; The Trilemma in KoreaThis paper tests the trilemma proposition by performing an empirical study of Korea. Korea has distinct periods of all combinations of exchange rate regime and capital market openness in trilemma: pegged exchange rate regime under capital controls, pegged exchange rate regime under free capital mobility, and floating exchange rate regime under free capital mobility. We check whether monetary autonomy exists in each of the three different combinations. We find that monetary autonomy existed over the periods with capital controls and the periods with floating exchange rate regime. For the periods with the pegged exchange rate regime and free capital mobility, monetary autonomy was limited. In addition, we identify that just before the financial crisis the government pursued autonomic monetary policy under pegged exchange rate regime and free capital mobility, thereby defying the trilemma."

"The main hypothesis of this research relies on the discrepancy between the evolution of the state and that of the other components of the socio-economic system as a factor of nations competitiveness. By adopting an evolutionist and historical perspective, the state is analyzed as an actor of the nations' evolution in their ability to absorb technological progress. The framework relies on the northian distinction between organizations and institutions, focusing on innovation's dynamics within public institutions and organizations. Both are analyzed as adaptive systems co-evolving in two temporal dimensions: the braudelian long-term since the Renaissance, and the present short-term of the information technologies revolution. The first part focuses on innovation as a socio-economic process stepping from disruption to continuities. Chapter I put in perspective the evolution of the state and of the technology. Chapter II analyzes what is at stake with the information technologies revolution. Chapter III assesses the role of the state and its evolution in the history of Great Britain and the US. The second part studies what are the possibilities for the state to get transformed (chapter I) drawing on an assessment on the New Public Management movement. The analyze goes on organizations (chapter II) through a comparison between cases of organizational transformation in France and in the US. A compared analysis between the ongoing institutional change in the budgetary framework in France and Canada allows to assess how to link institutional and organizational transformation. As a conclusion, the steering of such a reform appear to be socially feasible and technically mature, but suffers from a lag of evolution at the institutional level where politicians and mainstreams ideas dally in integrating the parameters of the third industrial revolution paradigm.

"« Enterprises of conviction», this term somewhat baroque designates however all that is classic in the universe of organizations: a company. And this, since its definition according to the jurisprudence of both the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Appeal of Paris and the Court of Cassation, in a media overexposed  legal case: the case Baby Loup.They are still little studied in Management Science, but neverthless they should  give plenty to think about, given the very terms of the definition « entities within which are expressly advocated an ideology, a morality, a philosophy or a policy, in other words, 'essential object of the activity  of these enterprises is the defense and the promotion of a doctrine or an ethics » which reexamines the very notion of the company.Thus,from a simple central question ""What is an enterprise of conviction and what is its contribution in the order of knowledge?"", we attempt to undertake a historical-theoretical reflection resulting in restoring its appearance and its existence as a phenomenon of human creation, with a certain ethico-religious anchorage. And this, under features and characteristics that we could confront by the facts observed on different field work."
"The professional development economic is in an unprecedented way subject to a standardization in the field of quality. A new quality framework is biding on all professional training institutes failing which they will be deprived of their main funding system. The purpose of this project is to study the integration phenomenon of this standard in a company and its interaction with the many standards already in place.The research project was based on the Intervention Research method, during a research contract in a consulting and training firm.The results show a double level of interaction between the standard and the company. First, with the existing standards and the way they are implemented in the company. Then, with the main institutional logic and what it implies for the players behaviors."
"In a context of strong increase of fuelwood demand in the collective sector, the supply issue becomes central to all stakeholders, raising many issues relating to land and forestry planning, local development, environment ... Meanwhile, questions emerge: how much energy can be mobilized sustainably? Does the spatial and structural configuration of forests influence the supply process? Do we seek to minimize transport distances? Can we observe spatial competition between the boilers ? To understand the current organization of supplies, we analyzed two sets of data traceability of wood chips. Then, we have developed a model of local supply basins, considering constraints of renewability of the resource, and conflicts of use, by combining various information sources: vegetation index derived from satellite imagery, forest mapping and production tables. The objective of this approach was dual : to determine the quantity of forest chips workable on a territory, and to highlight the spatial competition between the different basins supply, and the contribution of different tree species. This has enabled to show the importance of the energy potential of isolated trees, to our knowledge not previously evaluated in a sub-regional scale."
"Sales promotions have experienced considerable growth over the past twenty years. Paradoxically, a growing number of academics and marketers argue that sales promotions are a sub-optimal by-product of price competition without any intrinsic utility for the consumer beyond reducing prices. In the first section of this dissertation, we re-examine the utility of sales promotions from the consumer's perspective. In so doing, we enlarge the currently dominant model of consumer response to sales promotions which is mainly focused on the economic dimension of sales promotions and on their effects on consumer purchase behavior. In the second section, we develop scales measuring the multiple consumer benefits of sales promotions and experimentally study their effects on brand choice. Our results show that consumers evaluate sales promotions on the basis of their utilitarian benefits: savings, but also quality and convenience. Sales promotions also provide consumers with hedonic benefits: entertainment, exploration and self-expression. We then show that monetary promotions are more effective for utilitarian products and that non-monetary promotions are more effective for hedonic products. In the third section, we examine the effects of sales promotions on consumption behavior. Field and laboratory experiments show that promotional stockpiling accelerate the consumption of the promoted product. They also show that this effect is partially due to the higher visibility and lower price of the promoted product. A scanner data analysis further shows that the effects of promotional stockpiling on consumption are only significant for substitutable products consumed on impulse. Overall, our results suggest to reconsider the utility of sales promotions for they can have an intrinsic utility for the consumer and they can increase primary demand by accelerating product consumption.

"This thesis discuss about the longevity / mortality risk and its impact on pension funds and insurers. In the first part, we consider and expose the different mortality models. The state of art done, we propose an extension, using the Lévy processes, of the well-known model CBD. The Lévy processes are considered to take in account of jumps in mortality curve. The new model will be used, in the second part of this thesis, as underlined index to value the longevity derivatives. We use the Wang and Esscher Transforms as martingales measure because of incompleteness of the longevity market. These two measures are, beforehand, defined and the ways they represent pricing measures are exposed. Finally, we propose a new contract “the mortality collar”, which is a hedging instrument against the longevity or mortality risk, as well as for insurer, but also for pension fund. We give a complete analysis of this new management tool regarding its mechanism and its pricing"
"This dissertation investigates the value of information in the context of the economics of green buildings, by combining theoretic, empirical and experimental approaches. First, the perception of Energy Performance Certificate is studied through an artefactual field experiment on a representative sample of the French population. We point up a mixed cognitive efficiency for the label. A significant part of the population ignores it, however attentive subjects do use the label to revise their prior beliefs on energy quality. Second, we provide evidence of the capitalization of this information into real estate prices over two French regions. Low-consumption houses exhibit, ceteris paribus, a significant green premium that matches with techno-economic estimations of associated renovation costs. However, despite this ‘green value’, the pace of energy renovations remains slow in the French market: the energy label information does not reduce  uncertainty on the outcomes of the renovation process. In a third time, we show through a strategic option model that the lack of reliable information about renovation quality can delay investment decisions, and even inhibit their diffusion. Recently, several innovations have opened the possibility of producing reliable information on quality in the building industry. Then, fourthly, we explore with a laboratory experiment people's Willingness-To-Pay for information. Its magnitude is evidenced as significantly higher than information theoretic value. Nonetheless, pricing information has overall mixed effects on behaviors, inducing more strategic thinking but also some cognitive biases. A careful design of information markets is thus required."
"The objective of this thesis is to contribute, from a theoretical viewpoint, in the understanding of the reasons of the highly publicized success of microcredit in developing countries in order to analyze its efficiency conditions in developed countries. In the first chapter, we seek to identify the key factors of the observed success of group loans, a prevailing practice in developing countries, to demonstrate that they themselves hardly meet these specific conditions and that developed countries satisfy such conditions with even more difficulties. For that, we conduct a descriptive presentation of the main terms in group lending, followed by a theoretical analysis of the incitative mechanisms based on the work of Ghatak (1999), Ghatak and Guinnane (1999) and Guttman (2008). In the second chapter, we focus on an alternative microcredit practice, which is entrepreneurial-like, more appropriate to the rather complex socioeconomic climate of industrialized countries and used in the intent of promoting self-employment. It is a practice that involves matching a microcredit with mentoring funded clients. After pinpointing the stakes and the specificities of this practice, we suggest an analytical model that takes into account the various effects induced by the mentoring included in microcredit supply. Finally, we show that providing mentoring to funded clients in order to sustain microcredit supply is no panacea. The efficiency of this mentoring is specifically linked with the efficiency of the control mechanisms of the microfinance institutions (MFIs) in the selection of the funded projects; otherwise, mentoring may generate a negative bias (or perverse effects). Government intervention is then justified, mainly via three subsidy measures that we put forth, so as to act on the incentives of the participants and to improve the overall efficiency of the mechanism."
"Open source software (OSS) has led to important industrial transformations. The extent and intensity of this phenomenon require a theoretical discussion of some subjects in management sciences. This thesis deals with the impact of OSS and summarizes the main issues of its dissemination. We show firstly that the original model of OSS development comes from the combination of a system of solidarity and a distributed production process. Next, we describe new interactions between commercial and non-commercial activities which lead to new and original organizations. Then, we present the ways in which these pieces of software are used as standard components by industrial groups to generate value. We also describe other strategies which are aimed at using various technological means to bypass the rules of OSS licences. And finally, we suggest that most innovations created by open source organizations are aimed at remedying failures of the market-oriented system. "
"The thesis is conducted in the form of an intervention research carried out within the framework of an Industrial Research Training Agreement (CIFRE), established between a SME specializing in the manufacture of aluminum products and the CORHIS laboratory. The thesis examines the international HR management standards of the ISO 9000 series (quality management) and ISO 30400 series (human resources management), with a particular focus on the latter, which are the first international standards in the field of HRM. We seek to determine how the standardization of HR management contributes to the creation of organizational value and the development of human potential and, ultimately, to socio-economic performance. Our research focuses on the socio-economic theory of organizations (Savall and Zardet, 2010). From the mobilization of theoretical foundations, we hypothesized that the standardization of HR management contributed to the creation of organizational value and the development of human potential. Following the analysis of qualitative, quantitative and financial results from a qualimetric perspective, we emphasized that the standardization of HR management contributes to the reinforcement of managerial practices, the control of processes and activities, and the creation of organizational value, although the norm generates heaviness and constraints that can be a source of hidden costs. Finally, we emphasized that the normative approach of HRM contributes to the development of human potential and the transformation of the HR function."
"Our main purpose in this thesis is to contribute to extending the probabilistic analysis of voting rules to the consideration of four candidate elections, on the onehand, and to the study of the majority efficiency of Evaluative Voting with 3 levelsand its manipulability by coalitions of voters, on the other hand. These two issues lead to a unique technical problem, consisting in computing the limiting probability of an electoral event when 24 possible individual preferences have to be considered. The answers we have tried to bring to this methodological question constitute, together with the numerous results describing the theoretical likelihood of various electoral outcomes, the main contributions of our study to probabilistic analysis invoting theory."
"Mediation allows us to rethink the heterogeneous world. But in the literature, there are several perspectives of mediation where we perceive the lack of continuity between the different mediation practices as noted by a large number of authors (Lalonde 2001, Chini 2001, Battistoni 2012). Hence our research question on how to catalyze a “mediation continuum” approach.The first part of the thesis develops a review of the literature on Mediation: Habermas's theory of communicational action, to its current interpretations, that led us to identify the analytical grid: Objective, Relationship, Process and Duration that we used to inventory mediation practices applied today then we putted forward our three research questions:  Mintzberg adhocratic structure (1) combined with the trust factor (2) and orchestra-man factor (3) as the configuration allowing the desired “mediation continuum”.The second part lays out a methodology based on a hybrid exploratory survey conducted using an abductive approach where we collect data through a qualitative survey, semi-directive interviews and participative observations in order to exploit the organization Association educative Sino-Française (A.C.E.S.F) as a platform to answer the research questions.The third part puts forward the lessons learned from the case study, their interpretations and that we have concluded with the methodological and managerial contributions: structured mediation inventory (1) attributes to mediators in an intercultural framework (2) form of trust and the cultural specificity of the interlocutor in an intercultural context (3) and managerial input of this work that consists in a form of adhocratic chain as an organigram."
"While research on CSR has so far been largely developed at the macro level, looking at the impact of these policies on employees (individual level of analysis or micro CSR) is an innovative approach (Rupp et al., 2006). Indeed, the employees are the functional core in the success of the CSR policy. They are more likely to evaluate and react to CSR activities. CSR can be considered from the perspective of organizational justice theories (Rupp, 2011). In particular, through third-party justice research (DeCremer and van Hiel, 2006, Skarlicki and Kulik, 2005), it is possible to examine employees' perceptions of their organization's policy towards external stakeholders. Employees can judge the distributive, procedural and interactional justice of their organization (Colquitt et al., 2001).The purpose of this thesis is precisely to study the consequences of justice perceptions towards external stakeholders on employee attitudes and behaviors, including organizational commitment. It is also important to understand the mechanisms that link employees' perception of justice with their attitudinal and behavioral responses because each employee is unique in his own psychological reactions. We propose to integrate the deontic justice with other psychological mechanisms in mediation or moderation to better explain organizational commitment."
"In the 19th C, the towns in Alsace and Lorraine grew rapidly, as elsewhere in Europe, vwith the exception of those with a military role whose expansion was limited by agreement. Given the increase in distance travelled, new forms of transport were developed. The construction of railways increased the need for complementary urban transport. Technological developments enabled these new systems to carry more people, faster, over a wider area. Given the new border between Germany and France, Alsace and Moselle urban transport systems were subject to German law, and those in Epinal, Longwy and nancy to French law. The first World War disrupted local tranport systems and put an end to their expansion. Economic difficulties and the increase in the use of motorcars inhibited their return to previous operating levels. The systems in areas annexed by France were obliged to apply French law. All transport systems had to adapt until a new equilibrium was reached. This was disrupted again by WWII. At the end of WW II the aera was in chaos with the result that urban transport systems could no longer meet the demand. Under public pressure, local councillors gave high priority to renewing local transport systems, with the result that they expanded again. In the 1960s, their use declined, but in the 1970s they were again politically desirable. By the 1980s, under pressure from the ecologists, the general public accepted the need to reduce motor traffic in urban areas. The 2000s mark the beginning of a new era, with intermodal public transport systems being built with their own routes. "
"This PhD focuses on the internationalization strategies of Chinese companies, specifically those that are setting up in Europe. Through a series of empirical studies, we aim to treat several aspects with regard to the strategies employed by these Chinese companies. In our first case study, we have identified various international development paths adopted by Chinese firms in reference to existing theories. Subsequently, we conducted, through a second case study, a comparative analysis of two distinct theoretical frameworks (OLI and LLL model). This allowed us to highlight the important explanatory potential of these two theories during different times and contexts in which Chinese firms are embedded. Thirdly, we focused more specifically on partnerships between Chinese multinationals and French SMEs. This work revealed how these two types of firms may overcome various difficulties in combining their reciprocal asymmetries. In the end, according to the concept of psychic distance proposed by the Uppsala model, we addressed the impact of psychic distance in the case of Chinese multinationals. Through a quantitative study, we proposed that due to various societal evolution (advancement  of  information technologies, improvement  of  the  transport, etc.)and to certain capabilities of Chinese  multinationals, the psychic distance related  difficulties  faced  by  Chinese multinationals are less than those presumed by the Uppsala model."
"As part of the exercise of their profession, auditors are confronted with situations involving ethical dilemmas. We wonder if training can influence his or her ethical reasoning and the perception of the dilemma. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to determine if an ethics course had an influence on their ethical reasoning process and their perception of the moral intensity of ethical issues. The results show that training increases the ability to identify an ethical dilemma, but seems to limit its perceived intensity. On the other hand, counter-intuitively, training appears to decrease the intention to act strictly in accordance with deontological codes, in favor of an action more consistent with the personal ethics of the auditor. A qualitative study based on semi-directive interviews with experienced auditors supports these results. Discussions with supervisors or with peers and experience are ways of learning that complement theoretical training and influence the ethical intent of auditors, sometimes moving them away from a response that is strictly in accordance with the rules of law."
"This thesis studies territories attractivity and the role of direct foreign investment localization on the Tunisian economy. It is about examining the factors of attractivity of Tunisia on direct foreign investment and their effects on the Tunisian economy. On a first empirical analysis, an administrative enquiry to a sample of foreign, or having foreign participation enterprises, has been implemented to identify the direct foreign investment determinations. The use of an econometric example of « logit » type allowed us to estimate on one part the probability that Tunisia is an attractive country before the revolution and on the other one that the foreign enterprise implants on other filial in Tunisia after the revolution. To confirm our empirical analysis on the identification of the factors of attractivity determining the direct foreign investment, we implemented, on a second empirical analysis, an other econometric method through a gravity example. On a last empirical analysis, we studied the DFI effects on the Tunisian economy by using a simultaneous equations system example taking into account the DFI spillovers effects."
"This thesis is divided in three parts: The first part is devoted to the design of a supply chain at the strategic level. A systematic approach is proposed based on five macro-activities. Software has been developed to support this approach. It is presented in detail. In the second part of the thesis, solutions of O. R. Problems related to supply chains at the strategic level are proposed. In particular, models related to the selection of partners are developed. The last part of the thesis is dedicated to problems that are the most sensitive in a supply chain environment: real time scheduling, assembly problem when components are outsourced and definition of a sharing process in a specific example.

"The subject of this doctoral thesis deals with the analysis of regional unemployment heterogeneity and dynamics, the response of economic growth to negative shocks and the link between financial development and growth on a firm and country level. Chapter 1 shows the distributional dynamics of European regional unemployment. In this joint work with Robert Beyer, we study the behavior of regional unemployment rates with respect to the introduction of the Euro and the Global Financial Crisis and analyze European and country contributions to relative changes over time. Chapter 2 provides an empirical analysis into growth convergence of western European and transition countries after negative shocks. A collaboration with Olivier Damette and Mathilde Maurel, we study the rebound capacity, the speed of convergence to the normal growth path as well as nonlinearities along the process. Chapter 3 takes a closer look at internal financial constraints of firm growth in Serbia. A joint work with Milos Markovic, we show how much Serbian firms depend on cash flow for their expansionary activities and compare our sensitivity results with Belgium, a country with an advanced financial sector. Finally, in chapter 4 I explore the relationship between financial development and economic growth in transition countries. Through a panel Granger causality framework different financial indicators and their effects on per capita GDP as well as opposite causalities are assessed."
"The purpose of this thesis is to study the internal mechanisms of banks’ governance and their impact on the risk-taking behavior. We show that Adam Smith had already highlighted the inadequacy of the governance’ mechanisms in “Ayr” Bank as the primary factor leading to an excessive risk-taking and, consequently, to its bankruptcy. We develop a model that aims to evaluate the extent to which governance mechanisms play a moderating role on the compensation policy and the level of risk taken by the CEO. We illustrate that a remuneration indexed on risky assets does not imply a greater risk taking. We also conclude that in order to induce the CEO to achieve the best combination of assets, the board of directors (BD) is required to pay the highest compensation. The thesis also focuses on the study of standard BD attributes as well as those related to risk’ governance in EU banks from 2005 to 2015. The empirical investigation showed that certain BD features affect the level of non-performing loan and the insolvency of EU banks. The results of the fixed-effect quantile regression reveal that the effect of the standard BD and risk’ governance attributes on risk-taking is heterogeneous. More specifically, we can note that the positive effect of the independence and frequency of board meetings on bank’ risk management is more significant in the riskier banks. In addition to this, our empirical results suggests that the prevention of excessive risk taking by EU banks requires the improvement of the effectiveness of BD through the establishment of risk an audit committees."
"This research work is focused on the competitive dynamics approach and rivalry studies between competitors. It develops theses recent perspectives and particularly multimarket competition (also called multipoint competition) in deregulated industries (network utilities). Indeed, competitive behaviours in liberalized industries are still badly-known. To conduct this research, we decided to analyze a selection of companies (EDF, Electrabel, Endesa, Enel, Gaz de France, Poweo, Direct Energie…) settled on the French electricity market presently in the course of liberalization (1996 – 2006). This qualitative research, through longitudinal case studies, has been developed thanks to a CIFRE agreement (between the French Ministry of Research and the firm Electrabel France) including action research and participant observation. Using multidimensional strategic sequences, we identified two periods, the first one characterized by a confrontation movement and a second one by mutual forbearance. We argue that after learning the rules of a newly liberalized market (confrontation, diversification, internationalization), competitors rapidly and collectively shift there positions towards a focused European strategy based on the gas-electricity convergence. The development of multimarket competition has conducted to mutual forbearance, which was particularly profitable to the major participants. Integrated strategy (market & non-market) appears as an important driver for legitimating theses behaviours. "
"The energy transition to low-carbon energy is now a dominant paradigm in energy-related public policies. It is a central focus of work for the French regions. The evolution of their relationship with energy is both in line with European experiences and in the wake of a national incentive for transition. The objective of this thesis is to study the territorialization of renewable energy (RE) production according to its different origins (biomass, solar, geothermal, wind and hydro). We propose to assess the regions' performance in diversifying the energy mix in 2015 and over the period 1990-2015. Multidimensional data analysis methods were used. A typology of French regions characteristic of the regional development of renewable energies (RE) in France in 2015 is proposed, it highlights the emergence of five typical RE development profiles that are highly contrasted according to the RE sectors. The analysis of evolving data adopted to study regional dynamics in terms of RE promotion over the period 1990-2015 highlights four sub-periods of RE development. The Hierarchical Ascending Classification (HAC) over each sub-period has highlighted three distinct types of RE development profiles and a certain stability in the trajectories of the regions. This very stable structure shows that disparities between regions in the early 1990s persisted throughout the period. Finally, the study of the determinants of RE consumption at the regional level made it possible to identify the main levers favouring their deployment. Indeed, we have shown through the estimation of a VECM model that in the short term, past economic growth measured by the real GDP growth rate positively affects RE consumption, while nuclear and industrial production per capita have a negative impact. In the long term, estimates from the FM-OLS and DOLS models indicate that the level of economic development, measured by the logarithm of GDP per capita, has a positive impact on the share of RE in final energy consumption. The results also show that research and development spending favours the use of REs, which are largely dependent on population density. Finally, we show that at the regional level, the weight of ""green"" parties has a positive influence on the development of renewable energies."
"This thesis uses quarterly and annual data on capital market prices covering the period 2003-2009 additionally to annual accounting data during the period 2003-2010 of banks in both emerging and recently developed countries. The purpose of the thesis is to investigate empirically the effect of using derivative instruments (forwards, swaps, options and futures) on bank risk and performance. Main results reveal that in except to options the other derivative types decrease bank risk. Thus, there is no proof that derivatives can be the cause of bank failure or distress. In addition, results show that using derivatives in the whole diminish bank performance. Indeed, adjudication that derivatives are beneficial is not allowed. Finally, comparing results expose that the effect of derivatives on bank risk and performance is almost the same either in banks from emerging or recently developed countries. Ultimately, the ongoing debate on implication of derivatives in the recent financial crises should be revised"
"This research aims to explore the concept of entrepreneurial teams and their features through an understanding of how they make decisions. The research aims to better understand the role of the heterogeneity of the members in making decisions. After a theoretical justification that highlights the main concepts and theories related to the phenomena studied, the research implements an empirical research which, through the process of triangulation, explore the role of diversity in the entrepreneurial team decision-making process. The qualitative approach, adopted for collecting data from seven cases at various stages of development, allows analyzing the logic of team dynamics, leadership, functioning and evolution of these phenomena. The approach in the long term emphasizes the relationship between the team members and their ways in making decisions at the different stages of the evolution of the organization. The second part of this research helps to show the characteristics of the entrepreneurial teams, covering types of decisions faced by the team and the role of the diversity of its members in the decision-making process. The observed results contribute both to clarify a theoretical approach, and to offer practical proposals to new venture founders and consultants in business creation. Research suggests that the entrepreneurial team is a dynamic and evolving entity where the behavior of its members changes with the stages of development of the organization. The diversity of the members plays an important role in rising good alternatives, making the adequate decisions, and improving implementation as well. In addition, diversity acts on the leadership style and dynamics of the team, which result in the development of a learning process. The size of the organization and development of productivity significantly alter the behavior of team members and the role of diversity within the team and the organization."
"This thesis studies the role of social conformity in voting. In the first chapter, we presentthe definition of social conformity in social psychology. We review key elements of literature in order toshow the influence of conformity. In the second chapter, we conduct a literature review on the economicrole of conformity, which brings together work in experimental economics and social psychology. In thethird chapter, we present theoretical models in behavioral economics studying the role of conformity.On this basis, the fourth chapter is devoted to an economic approach to modeling the preferencesof conformity as voters’ desire to win in a re-election under Majority rule. Concretely, we offer anexplanation about how voters’ desire to win can deter incumbents from inefficient decisions while inoffice. In the fifth chapter, the thesis comes to model conformity preferences as desire to make the samevote as the majority in voting for collective decision-making under the unanimity rule. The findingsof the model highlight that conformity preferences can improve the sum of voters’ social welfare andalleviate the free-rider problem. Though conformity has always had a bad reputation, all our resultsshed light on its usefulness in various contexts to vote."
"This thesis examines the role and the impact of pressure groups in environmental regulation process.Indeed, in recent years, scientific controversies (GMO, Médiator, shale gas) have lead us to wondermore about their effects, especially when the achievement or the extent of environmental damage and /or health are uncertain. In particular, in the context of a market approval process of a potentialdangerous product, we assume that two pressure groups are fighting, representing respectively theinterests of industry and those of victims of damage: the first campaigns for its authorization and thesecond for its prohibition. In this context, information available to the voluntary regulator is important.Assuming that he is unaware of the magnitude of the damage ex ante, we question the relevance ofpaying attention to lobbyists to take a socially efficient decision, in a case where the industrial groupfaces a responsibility system, ex post. However, the application of this system is imperfect, because ofthe insolvency of the industry or by the fact either that the industrial group responsibility is notrecognized, or that the victims group does not request compensation for damages. When the regulatortakes his decision based on a contest, the introduction of a sequential contest in which the outsidermoves first is socially preferable. Moreover, the conditions under which the regulator has to payattention to the pressure groups rather than taking his decision based on a cost-benefit analysis, usinghis prior beliefs on damage, are characterized."
"In the context of globalization and urbanization, the rapid industrialization of emerging countries drives on deep transformations in lifestyles and consumption habits. Hence, an intense process of nutrition transition occurs: nutritional deficiencies and infectious diseases decline, but persist, while obesity and comorbidities reach endemic levels. Facts point that nutrition transition process is not homogenous at the worldwide level and within a given society. Such heterogeneity can be explained by the presence of social, economic and cultural factors. In order to explore the relationship between these factors and obesity, the study focuses on Mexico, an emerging country which has fully begun its nutrition transition process since the 1980s’. First, I analyze the socioeconomic determinants of body-mass and show that weight gain particularly affects a lower middle class on the verge of poverty. Both the lack of education and earning an extra income appear to be risk factors for lower social categories. Furthermore, I study the effects of body-mass on educational and occupational failures. The findings uncover mechanisms by which both obesity and central adiposity reduce one’s capacity to climb the socioeconomic ladder. Finally, I assess the impact of the Mexican conditional cash transfers’ program on adult body-mass. The results suggest that social programs constitute an adequate intervention to break the vicious cycle of poverty and obesity. Since the conditionalities counterbalance negative externalities from an extra income, such programs significantly improve health and nutritional knowledge and behaviors of participants. To conclude, the thesis dissertation emphasizes the necessity for policy makers to simultaneously take into account social, economic, and cultural aspects of obesity."
"The success of the US innovation model to help start-ups emerge as global leaders has greatly influenced many regulatory changes on Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and the external finance of firms in Europe. This study aims to analyze the role and importance of these changes in the organization and performance of software firms. We show that multiple regulatory mutations of IPR have paved the way for some kind of “restricted” patentability of software in Europe. In parallel, via changes in financial markets, they play an increasing role in the growth and development of young innovative companies. In addition, it seems that the strategic use of patents is complementary with software firms’ access to capital markets. We study this complementarity by analyzing the value of patents as signals for IPO markets and their impact in the likelihood of survival of newly-listed companies. We argue that this complementarity may explain the increased importance of patents in a sector where patents are highly controversial. It refers to a particular market selection process and the appearance of winning and losing actors."
"In the context of setting up clusters and the latest laws on decentralization (2004 and 2013), the regions saw their skills for economic development and innovation increased. That’s why they are more involved in the conduct of science and technology policies. Thus, this study aims to examine the effectiveness of science and technology policies (S&T) at the regional level. Indeed, the legitimacy of this level in the S&T policy could be challenged since the production of technology tend to be more and more globalized. Moreover, this regional legitimacy can be approached from the perspective of regional innovation systems (RIS), which constitute a theoretical framework suitable for the treatment of this issue. Considering the importance of regional level, especially in economic and technological policies, SRI is a framework which aims to analyze the links between science, industry and local governance. Faced to these challenges, the Aquitaine Region asks itself questions. Indeed, it has increased its S&T budget since the last ten years and today is the French region with the highest S&T budget per capita. Now the Aquitaine Region wants to know how effective its S&T policy is. Is this effort in terms of S&T necessary or justified? What is the consistency of regional policy over time? What is the result of such a policy a socio-economic point of view? These issues will be studied using of evaluation’s tools. Furthermore, we offer to synthetize the objectives of S&T and the means used by the Region and we develop a comparative approach to other regional experiences on differents dimensions of innovation."
"This thesis studies the environmental inequalities in an objective of social justice. The first part offers an interdisciplinary definition of these inequalities in order to catch their multidimensional nature and to show their usefulness in environmental economics and ecological economics. Based on a philosophy of economics perspective, the fairness of environmental inequalities is analysed by using different egalitarian conceptions of justice with a consideration of the existence of other societal objectives. Following this theoretical development, the second part is devoted to an analysis of the issues of access to water and sanitation services in the context of Brazil. After a discussion over the situation related to the water and sanitation sector in Brazil, the socioeconomic and institutional determinants of the access to these services are identified using econometric analyses at the household level. These analyses enable to expose key determinants in the perspective of environmental justice including income level and ethnicity. In addition, they show the role of the state level thanks to the use of multilevel models. By using an indicator of the access to water and sanitation services elaborated through a factor analysis, the inequalities associated to these services are then measured by different methods which correspond to each conception of justice developed in the first part."
"Challenged by turbulent environment, firms are driven to make extra efforts in order tothrive. Technology intelligence, as a vector of knowledge of innovation dynamics, constitutes aninstrument at the firms’ disposal to help steer their economic activities.The aim of this thesis, funded by Groupe PSA, is to participate in the enhancement of theimplementation of technology intelligence within large industrial groups.The first part of this Ph.D. thesis aims at making technology intelligence more comprehensible inorder to reinforce its purposes in the innovation process of firms.To this end, we will call upon theoretical elements from the resources and competencies based view ofthe firm in order to answer three questions: Why is the understanding of the external environment ofthe firm a necessity? What is its place within the organization of the firm? What is the significance oftechnological intelligence for strategic and operational management of innovation?By putting technology intelligence into practice, the second part of this thesis focuses on improvingcollection methods of data required for the analysis of the external environment of the firm. Moreprecisely, the intent is not only to determine the informational benefits of patent data and the seldomused financial data, but also to make practical recommendations for their exploitation."
"It’s commonly accepted that global warming will have important consequences formany vineyards throughout the world, with impacts on wine production, on grape quality andtherefore on wines quality. In Bordeaux and other regions, warming is partly the cause of achange in the chemical composition of the grapes harvested under conditions of excessivematurity. The wines resulting from their vinification are richer in alcohol, less acidic andmarked by aromatic characteristics reminiscent wines produced in warmer and dryer latitudes.In this context, global warming will involve important economic stakes in wine consumption,and it may be useful to know the capacity of consumers to accept these wines durably. Theobjective of this thesis work is both forward-looking in relation to global warming and itsconsequences on wines quality and at the same time on the sustainable match between supplyand demand.The analysis methodology is an experimental market coupled with a sensory analysis.Experiences with consumers showed the influence of the characteristics of global warmingwines on consumer’s preferences and the wines valorisation on the market. Finally, the resultsshow that consumers have differentiated valorizations for oenological processes aimed atcorrecting the negative effects of global warming."
"The objective of this dissertation is to identify the effects of trade costs on the quality structure of international trade flows. In chapter one we empirically analyze the determinants of Cognac export flows and emphasize the role of trade costs. We show that, as with other luxury products, the elasticity of Cognac exports to distance is negative and relatively small. Meanwhile, average customs duties do not have a significant impact on the intensive margin, but we find that they negatively affect the probability of trade, after correcting for an endogeneity bias. In chapter two we empirically test the validity of the Alchian and Allen effect that states that per-unit charges increase the relative demand of higher quality goods. We use data on Cognac exports by quality designations. The measure of Cognac quality is objective and invariant over time. Our results show that distance and specific duties increase the share of exports of higher quality Cognac. We also examine the impact of containerization on Cognac's quality mix from 1967 to 2013. In chapter three we build a theoretical model of a North-South duopoly where firms compete in prices on both markets. We use this framework to study the impact of several trade policy instruments (import tariff, quota and quality standard) on the product R&D investment of the Northern firm. Our results show that the Northern firm's R&D expenditures increase with each policy instrument except for the import quota."
"This thesis studies the impacts of remittances in migrants' origin countries. Six different chapters focus on economic growth, volatility and public policies. The first chapter aims to estimate the impacts of remittances on growth through several channels: households' consumption, investment and exports. It is shown that remittances stimulate internal demand, while exports are reduced. The second chapter proposes a stock-flow consistent model for Moldova and suggests that remittances spread external shocks to the Moldovan economy. Chapter three shows that migrants' concentration in few host countries, as well as their instability, increase the volatility of remittances. Chapter four stresses that instable remittances enhance output growth volatility in migrants' origin countries when associated with important trade flows between both origin and destination countries. The fifth chapter focuses on public health spending and shows that remittances increase out-of-pocket health expenditure while crowding-out public health expenditure. The last chapter highlights the role of remittances on the economic development of Moldova. It suggests that both households and government revenues depend on remittances, whose fluctuations cast doubts about the economic sustainability of the Moldovan model of development."
"The analysis we present in this dissertation emerges from a confrontation of the recent literature on structural change and the literature on global value chains. Productive transformation is almost exclusively analysed through exports transformation. However, the international fragmentation of production makes this export-based approach hazardous. The potential gap between factor content of exports and countries’ factor endowments imply that exports modernization may only be an illusion. We address the complex and multidimensional nature of structural change given the current economic context and we examine innovative determinants of structural transformation. We develop the idea of a sustainable structural transformation that we describe through aggregate indicators. The analysis of the determinants through descriptive and econometric methods reveals risks of lock-in situations as well as risks of immiserising specialisation in the industrialization process, specifically in the textile and electronic sectors. We also find that defying factor endowments encourages diversification towards sophisticated exports. However this transformation is unsustainable especially when countries are major FDI recipients. We show that FDI positively influences factor content of exports while they have a negative impact on factor endowments. Thus, a productive transformation generated through FDI does not imply factor accumulation. Finally, export sophistication seems to rely more on FDI rather than on capabilities accumulation, meaning that the sustainability dimension is essential in an export-based approach of structural transformation."
"The term “urban renewal” is polysemic and ambiguous, ever-changing depending on the political context in which it is being used. Policies of urban renewal require to have identified the mechanisms applied to urban spaces and to have understood their genesis. In order to do so, the American policy of urban renewal alongside several European experiments help to understand the positioning of the French urban renewal, a policy which oscillates between a curative effort towards neighborhoods faced with socioeconomic difficulties and a prospective strategy encompassed within a comprehensive, metropolitan project aimed at attracting new residents. This thesis builds on an analysis of the demographic growth of French urban areas to posit that urban renewal is spatially defined shaped in core cities and suburbs. It examines how the duality of urban renewal (both prospective and curative strategies) applies to French policies of urban renewal supported by the “PNRU” (National Program of Urban Renewal). The study reveals the differentiated actions of the program depending on the spaces analyzed through the lens of growth, resurgence and decline of French cities. The economic analytical framework of urban renewal reveals dual mechanisms linked to markets and externalities."
"This thesis provides an economic analysis of household waste management in Vietnam. Afterstudying the various stakeholders and their fields of competence at the national level, ittargets the urban areas of the country in particular in order to identify the nature of the wasteproduced and the regulation and financing conditions for its management. Furthermore, anassessment of household behavior vis-à-vis the improvement of household waste managementis proposed using a contingent evaluation. Starting from a survey carried out on 416households in the city of Hanoi and 444 households in Ho Chi Minh City, an estimation of thewillingness to pay (using the Heckman method) reveals that households are prepared to payabout 0.51 euros and 0.56 euros per month per household respectively to improve the qualityof service of household waste disposal. The results of this empirical study are also used topropose concrete recommendations aiming to ensure greater efficiency in household wastemanagement in Vietnam."
"This thesis is a collection of three essays in theoretical auction analysis. Chapter 1 considersbid delegation in the GSP auction mechanism. In a game involving side-contracts and a compensationpolicy set by an agency, the first-best collusive outcome is achieved. We offer a characterization of the implementablebid profiles for the two-position game with three players. Chapter 2 considers the sequentialsale of an object to two buyers: one knows his private information and the other buyer does not. Buyershave a multi-unit demand and private valuations for each unit are perfectly correlated. An asymmetricequilibrium exists when the uninformed player adopts an aggressive bidding strategy. Conversely, hisinformed opponent behaves more conservatively by using bid shading. The bidding behaviour of theuninformed bidder is driven by the opportunity to learn his private valuation for free. This dynamic is atthe root of the decline in the equilibrium price across both sales. In chapter 3, information is observableduring the first-stage auction in a sequential-move game in which the first-mover bidder is observed byhis opponent. A separating equilibrium exists in which the informed bidder bids aggressively when he isthe first-mover which entails a non-participation strategy from his uninformed competitor. Conversely,the latter adopts a conservative behaviour when he is the first-mover. A pooling equilibrium in which theinformed bidder blurs his valuation can only exist if his uninformed opponent adopts a non-participatingstrategy."
"This thesis studies the role of moral emotions in the decision making of agents when they face asocial dilemma. The first two chapters present a large literature review, which gathers research inexperimental economics, in social psychology and in the management of organizations, in order to delineatethe way moral emotions, and specifically gratitude, are able to influence the economical decision process. Inthe third chapter, through a review of works in the field of behavioral economics, we take an interest in theprogressive integration of moral emotions into economic modeling. We thus show how this integration, whichis concurrent with the emergence of social preferences models, allows agents' decision-making processes to berepresented in a more realistic way, in situations where the behaviors that are observed empirically challengean egoistic and materialistic vision of people. In chapter four, the public good game is presented in detail,along with the main experimental results associated with it, in order to understand why this game suits theformal analysis of moral emotions' influence. Finally, our work culminates in the development of an originalmodel in behavioral economics, during chapters five and six, which aims at assessing how the emergence ofmoral emotions can influence, both statically and dynamically, the strategic choice of individuals in the publicgood game, and how the introduction of a reward phase can promote cooperation and help individuals todevelop good interpersonal relationships."
"In a series of empirical essays, this thesis looks at the various intertwining aspects of growth volatility and productive diversification in resource-rich countries. In the first chapter, I find that while natural resources adversely affect economic growth by increasing growth volatility, resource-rich countries can offset the volatility-triggering effects of natural resources by diversifying their economies. Countries that start off with more diversified production structure or are able to diversify as they develop are likely to benefit from their resource endowment. In the second chapter, I discuss the fact that resource-rich countries willing to diversify their economies are faced with dual policy options; to either develop resource-based industries, or diversify their economies as a whole into new activities not necessarily dependent on natural resources. The empirical analysis shows that diversification through downstream and forward linkages to mining does not lead to productivity enhancements. However, broadening and diversifying the production structure as a whole offer potentials for productivity growth at higher levels of income. In the third chapter, I look at the relation between diversification and volatility from a production network perspective, composed of input-output linkages across sectors. I find that the location of a sector within the production network and its influence on other sectors have conflicting effects on the risk that sectoral shocks lead to aggregate volatility. Sectors that are located in dense parts of the network have a mitigating effect on aggregate volatility via substitution effects, while those that are more influential and central in a strongly asymmetrical network generate aggregate fluctuations via contagion effects and inter-industry linkages. These suggest that the distribution and the network structure of inter-industry linkages play an important role into how diversification conditions the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on aggregate volatility."
"The objective of this thesis is to propose an answer to the question: Can intellectual property rights policies such as TRIPS be beneficial for developing countries and their catching-up process?To answer this question, we first look at the technological dynamics behind the catching-up process. The first chapter thus provides an empirical and analytical update on the catching-up and falling behind model by Verspagen (1991), which focuses on studying the role of the innovation and imitation dynamics in the catching up process. Mainly, we find that while the innovation dynamic is important for the catching-up process, the imitation dynamic is necessary to ensure that countries build solid capabilities that will enable them to prosper. The efficiency of the imitation dynamics is dependent on policy factors that make up the learning capability of firms and ensure firms succeed assimilating knowledge.The second chapter focuses on understanding the way those technological transfers from developed to developing countries can occur, we focus on studying the mechanisms behind two main channels, that is international trade and FDIs, which represent the main form of North-South interactions studied in the literature. From this chapter we conclude that there is a rich diversity of complex mechanisms.In the third chapter, we thus build an agent-based model (ABM) to represent those North-South interactions and their complexities, with an evolutionary economics approach. The model allows us to study a particular mechanism: transfers through the local labour mobility, a channel seldom discussed in the literature. This allows us to study the impact FDI may have on development and catching-up outcomes. We find that while FDI from developed countries can, under the right conditions, encourage technological transfers and thus catching up, there are potential negative effects on local industries, in particular in countries largely behind.The final chapter proposes an extension of the model that introduces patents, in order to answer the main question. We find that while patents help motivate northern firms to disclose their technology and thus facilitate development, those firms would require a perfect level of enforcement that will be too harsh on local firms, block imitations and also severely hinder the southern firms’ innovative efforts, while generating limited gains for northern firms."
"Burkina Faso, with more than 20% of the population suffering from undernourishment (FAO), is facing severe food insecurity like other sub-Saharan African countries (FAO). This country has implemented, since its independence in 1960, contrasting policies, initially interventionist policies in the aftermath of independence, and then liberal policies since the 90s as part of structural adjustment programs with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Different strategies against poverty have been implemented since the 2000s: Poverty Reduction Strategy Plans (PRSP), from 2000 to 2010, preceded a Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Sustainable Development (SAGSD) since 2011. But the results remained much mitigated in terms of poverty and food insecurity reduction. This thesis attempts to analyze the dynamics at work behind the weak progress in social indicators, including poverty and food security, despite macroeconomic performance recorded in recent decades. A Computable General Equilibrium Model (CGE) is used and calibrated on the major trends of Burkina Faso economy. It serves thus, on the one hand, to analyze explanatory mechanisms at work, and on the other hand to test two types of scenarios, the first assuming a decline in agricultural productivity that would result from a degradation of natural resources and climate change as highlighted in the literature. The second tests a large program of public investment in agriculture. The results show that the current dynamics can be analyzed in terms of poverty trap: natural constraints (poor endowment in natural resources) and high population growth, reinforced by weak public goods result in low labor productivity causing low revenue, low savings and then low investments behind the low labor productivity. A degradation of agricultural productivity significantly increases food insecurity of the poor and greatly reduces overall economic growth, while efficient public investment in agriculture can provide significant and rapid progress and solve the dilemma of agricultural policy: they are beneficial to rural and much more to urban poor populations."
"Corporate awards conferred upon companies, or more generally upon their manager, are a recent practice ; formerly, only a few products and some employees were rewarded. These awards are used to highlight the excellence of a compagny. Selecting the winner requires careful organisation. These awards also involve media coverage of the winner. But one can also wonder whether the true recipient of the award is not the person who may find it beneficial to diffuse standards (sales turnover, share of exports, quality assurance, respect of the environment, concern for sustainable development, etc). In this case, the award is not addressed to the winner. One must then understand that compagny awards are an original form of mediation aimed at standardizing companies on a world scale"
"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a multicriteria method to assess environmental impacts of goods and services. In its early stages, LCA, known as Attributional (ALCA), was used to assess environmental impacts in a status-quo situation for benchmarking, environmental communication and product development. Recent methodological developments led to Consequential LCA (CLCA), which aims to quantify direct and indirect impacts of changes, through market mechanisms, allowing for public policy assessment. The aim of this Ph.D. thesis is to develop a methodological framework to assess public policy instruments in the livestock sector by combining LCA and economic modellingThis thesis is organized into three axes: i) identification and characterization of environmental performances of dairy production technologies through ALCA; ii) adaptation of MATSIM-LUCA economic model to the needs of the thesis; iii) environmental impact assessment through CLCA of dairy quota removal and implementation of a grass premium in the European Union. This work provides i) initial development of a methodological framework for assessing public policy instruments in the livestock sector and ii) identification of several improvements needed to make the method operational for stakeholders."
"This thesis takes public policy analysis as theoretical framework to propose an analysis of regional industrial policy. Our analysis is based on historic, quantitative and qualitative methods.In a context where industrial public policy leans towards regionalization, under the influence of French decentralization and regionalization of European Union policies, we try to understand the mechanics of regional industrial policy through the case of Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. A policy inherited of the “planning policy”, and influenced by Colbertism and German model focused on mid-sized companies.Our first approach is quantitative and studies public grants allocated to industrial firms by the Region Nouvelle-Aquitaine. This analysis combines economic geography indicators and demonstrate a concentration phenomenon on a small group of regional companies.We extend by reintroducing complexity in the analysis thanks to rich qualitative materials: interviews with industrial leaders and institutional managers, and press archives."
"The popular concept, within the French school of industrial economics and of industrial policies, filiere from post-World War II to the early 1980s, is experiencing a resurgence in the current period. This revival was made, in language and political action, thanks to the 2009 Etats Generaux de l'Industrie (EGI). However, the vagueness surrounding the concept of filiere, which has led in part to its abandonment, has not been clarified. The objective of this thesis is to propose a vision of the notion of filiere that will make it possible to understand its dynamics in the current economic context characterized by an internationalization of productive activities. In addition to this conceptual dimension, the work that follows will propose methods for describing and analysing filiere. These methods will be applied to the field of oleo-proteaginous. The first part of the thesis will return to the statistical meanings and methods traditionally associated with the concept of filiere. The second part, based on meso-economical politics, will propose a meso-systemic conception and method of filiere in order to understand its dynamic."
"L’Europe et, en particulier, la France ont engagé une politique de transition énergétique, consistant à diminuer de 20 % les émissions de gaz à effet de serre, réduire de 20 % la consommation d'énergie et à atteindre 20 % d'énergies renouvelables dans le bouquet énergétique d'ici à 2020. Afin d’atteindre ces objectifs, plusieurs pistes doivent être déployées afin de promouvoir les énergies renouvelables qui sont de nature intermittente. Dans le cadre de ce projet de thèse on propose trois pistes pour contribuer au développement de ces énergies : la première consiste à déterminer la combinaison efficace des sources intermittentes et de sources fiables telle que les combustibles, ainsi que le montant optimal à investir dans les technologies renouvelables intermittentes sachant leur productivité imprévisible et variable. La deuxième piste de recherche consiste à déterminer, à l’aide d’un modèle dynamique, dans quelles circonstances on stocke de l’électricité et dans quelles circonstances on la délivre. Dans ce cadre, on essayera de déterminer un seuil optimal de stockage. La troisième piste consiste à déterminer comment on organise le secteur de l’effacement électrique. on appliquera le même principe que pour les parties précédentes : on a le modèle de base qui est l’intermittence modélisée par la variable aléatoire à laquelle on rajoutera l’effacement électrique. Dans le cadre de la thèse on espère publier trois articles complémentaires, un article sur chaque piste. Le lien entre ces trois pistes sera l’analyse et à la modélisation des différents instruments politiques, qui sont en ce moment en discussion au niveau français. L’objectif de cette analyse sera de faire un classement en fonction de leur capacité à atteindre un état optimal (ou à s’en approcher) sur chaque piste."

"The aim of this thesis is to understand the organizational and institutional mechanisms that drive a manufacturing firm to act on, and react to regulations. The comeback of the industrial policy in developed countries heightens the interest of studies on the effect of such policy, and particularly of regulations on regulated firms. However, scholars in the field of “regulatory capture” cannot consider both the complexity of the rules production and the concrete mechanisms of rules interpretation and integration in the firms’ economic activities. To open these two “black boxes”, we construct first a methodological framework based on the theory of fields. This framework considers regulations as an institution, and permits the analysis of both regulatory dynamics and affected industrial dynamics. Second, we elucidate this double dynamics by empirically studying the car manufacturers’ trajectories in Europe in relation to the air pollutants emissions limits. In clarifying the technical-economic context surrounding this regulation, we then elucidate its genesis and dynamics, highlighting the role of institutions and actors in the rule-making and transformation processes. Then, we show how air pollutants emissions limits are incorporated into the planning process of the car manufacturers’ activities. To conclude, we show that the interactions and inadequacies between the regulations dynamics and the planning activities imply nondeductible ex ante behaviors, as these two dynamics produce permanent uncertainty."
"MOOCs are innovative learning tools (Christensen, 2013), have an amplifying effect (Christensen, 2013) and have disrupted the world of in-company training (Karnouskos, 2017) On the basis of Cox's (2013) hypothesis, according to which digital technology allows the achievement of performativity on learner representations, research studies the performative impact of MOOC on the representations, ""the world of descriptions"" (Laurillard, 2002) of learners in companies. It thus analyses the dynamics of behavioural change and, consequently, managerial identities (Harding, 2003 cited by Aggeri, 2017). This work has thus made it possible to explain the key factors that enable the evolution of representations and the modification of behaviour in companies thanks to digital technology."
"In order to increase the perceived value of their offerings, companies can implement product enhancement strategies, consisting in adding new attributes to existing products. However, a literature review and an exploratory qualitative survey highlight that these marketing strategies are not always effective to improve the attractiveness of a complex product. To clarify the consequences of these innovation policies on perceived value of a product, an experiment has been carried out in the car industry. According to the results, a new attribute can only generate an additional emotional value. In contrast to this value creation, it may cause, in some cases, a decrease of the social or economic product value. Some of these effects can be explained by the perceived price and the perceived functional advantage of the added attribute. However, the perceived learning costs of the new feature don’t seem to be able to act, on the whole, on the process of enhanced complex product valuation."
"La présente thèse porte sur les enjeux de l’évaluation sociale des organisations de l’économie sociale et solidaire (ESS) en France. « Utilité sociale » et « impact social » sont les deux termes actuellement utilisés dans les débats socio-politiques et académiques en France pour se référer à la valeur sociale ou à la contribution sociale des organisations de l’ESS. Si dans la discussion ces deux termes sont souvent utilisés de manière confuse ou indistincte, cette thèse soutient qu’il s’agit de deux approches évaluatives hétérogènes et qui répondent à des enjeux différents. Sur la base d’une étude de terrain monographique - une démarche de recherche-action - menée à l’UCPA, l’objectif principal de cette thèse est de mieux comprendre la spécificité de l’approche évaluative de l’utilité sociale en abordant la relation entre évaluation, création de valeur et contribution au bien commun. Au sein du champ de la socio-économie, cette thèse s’inscrit dans une approche épistémologique constructiviste inspirée du pragmatisme et de l’institutionnalisme, et s’intéresse particulièrement à trois éléments du processus évaluatif : la définition de ce qui a de la valeur ou de « ce qui compte » ; les modalités d’évaluation ou de « prise en compte » ; et la mise en forme des résultats de l’évaluation ou la « reddition de comptes ». Dans un contexte où prédomine une vision utilitariste de l’évaluation, la thèse affirme l’importance des enjeux identitaires, sociaux et moraux de tout processus évaluatif, et montre que la spécificité de l’approche évaluative de l’utilité sociale est la prise en compte de la dimension constitutive et relationnelle de l’activité économique. La thèse propose également une façon nouvelle d’articuler les processus de qualification de l’utilité sociale et de mesure de l’impact social des organisations de l’ESS.This thesis deals with the issues of social evaluation of social and solidarity-based economy (SSE) organizations in France. ""Social utility"" and ""social impact"" are the two terms currently used in socio-political and academic debates in France to refer to the social value or social contribution of SSE organizations. In the discussion these two terms are often used in a confused or indistinct manner. This thesis argues that they are two heterogeneous evaluative approaches that respond to different issues. On the basis of a monographic field study - a action-research approach - conducted at UCPA, the principal objective of this thesis is to better understand the specificity of the evaluative approach to social utility by addressing the relationship between evaluation, value creation and contribution to the common good. Within the field of socio-economics, this thesis is part of a constructivist epistemological approach inspired by pragmatism and institutionalism, and focuses on three elements of the evaluative process: defining what is valuable or ""what counts""; the methods of evaluation or ""taking into account""; and formatting evaluation results or ""accountability"". In a context dominated by a utilitarian vision of evaluation, the thesis affirms the importance of identity, social, and moral issues of any evaluative process, and demonstrates that the specificity of the evaluative approach to social utility lies in taking into account the constitutive and relational dimension of economic activity. The thesis also proposes a new way of articulating the processes of the qualification of social utility and the measurement of social impact of SSE organizations."
"Urban regions in and close to the Alps have specific characteristics: they combine a limited land resource for urban development with particular environmental quality in their mountainous hinterland. This combination makes them particularly prone to peri-urbanisation, and potentially social segregation. In the context of continued metropolisation, both of these processes work against central objectives of urban planning, notably compactness of settlement patterns, functional mix, social equity and cohesion. In Alpine urban regions, the links between the mountain environment, urban planning policies and residential processes remain, however, not well understood.This thesis analyses urban planning and residential moves in an Alpine urban region. It seeks to understand the links between the mountain environment, urban planning and notably two residential processes: peri-urbanisation and social segregation. Its general objective is to investigate how and to what extent these residential processes are influenced by (i) the mountain environment and (ii) urban planning policies and to develop recommendations for urban and regional planning. The thesis does this via three distinct contributions which use the urban region of Grenoble in the French Alps as a central study area.The first contribution addresses changes in contemporary urban planning practice in the study region. Based on qualitative research, it focuses on the shift towards strategic spatial planning and on territorial re-scaling towards large urban-peri-urban planning perimeters. The chapter shows the creation of new governance arenas which call into question local planning cultures.The second contribution investigates the links between preferences for the natural environment, residential moves and social segregation. Using location choice models for the study region and the Marseille metropolitan area, this chapter presents a counterfactual segregation analysis that compares segregation outcomes ``with'' and ``without'' preferences for the natural environment. The main result is that households' search for natural environments has significant impacts on social segregation. It most often contributes to reinforcing segregation, but can also be an attenuating factor.The last contribution investigates the links between urban planning policies and residential processes. The chapter develops a residential location choice model in order to predict and analyse residential demand patterns for different planning policy scenarios in terms of concentration and segregation. The scenario results show that continued trends in urban planning policies would sustain and potentially reinforce peri-urbanisation in the region. Confining planning policies are found to be capable of curbing and potentially reversing demand dispersion. Policies that aim at re-centralising demand sustain and potentially increase social segregation levels.The results of this thesis call for a stronger integration of the natural environment in urban and regional planning. If spatial disparities in environmental qualities contribute to residential processes that are detrimental to compact urban forms and an equitable access to environmental quality, then planning should incorporate and account for these disparities in order to prevent further loss of land resources, socio-spatial fragmentation and environmental inequality, not only in an Alpine urban region context."
"This thesis lies in the fields of Public Economics and Political Economy and is articulated around two axes. The first and second chapters focus on redistributive policies. More precisely, they present contributions to the theory of income taxation, and adopt both a normative and a political economy perspective. The third and fourth chapters are grounded in political economy and contribute to providing a better understanding of political forces guiding reforms in multi-State unions such as the European Union. They focus on the preferences of individuals who are of great importance in decision-making processes but for whom little direct evidence is available: politicians.Both my first and second chapters seek to enrich a standard framework of optimal income taxation with new considerations, which allow to account better for both institutional and social contexts. Chapter 1 accounts for links between individuals when designing a redistribution system. Indeed, up until now income taxation problems have always dealt with redistribution between individuals, or couples, as separate entities. But in a lot of contexts, individuals are actually part of networks that may include their family, friends, village or community members, and make transfers to them on a regular basis. And this should matter to the government, because these transfers flow from richer to poorer individuals, and thus represent another form of redistribution, an informal one. My research question is then: how should the existence of such informal but redistributive transfers affect the design of income taxes? Chapter 2 starts from the observation that in many countries that have well-developed tax systems, the proportion of the population who does not pay the income tax is sizeable -- a salient feature of many tax systems in developed countries. Using tools from the normative taxation literature which we apply to a political economy of tax reforms framework, we manage to study the political economy of reforms of non-linear tax systems, which helps us understand why it might be the case that such important shares of the population are exempt from the income tax. Even though both chapters are theoretical, I use administrative and survey data to illustrate and draw concrete conclusions from my models.Finally, the last two chapters of my thesis are dedicated to a project on the preferences of French and German Members of Parliament for different EU integration measures. A first wave of questionnaire-based surveys was conducted in 2016. The aim of this project is to carry out these surveys on a regular basis so as to better understand European Union dynamics and help feed current EU debates with academic insights. The third and fourth chapters thus study the opinion of Members of Parliament regarding policies which hold particular importance in light of today's and the last ten years' debates: labour market policies, and the European Monetary Union. They provide a different take on political economy questions, and inform the preferences of an important set of actors in decision-making processes: politicians, for whom apart from their public votes and statements, little evidence is available on their opinions. In these chapters we seek to disentangle which of two factors is most important in the differences observed: cultural or ideological differences?  Surprisingly, we find that for a majority of questions the answers reflect more of an ideological (left/right) divide than a French/German one. For instance, the creation of a common unemployment insurance and more labor market flexibility highlight a divide that pertains much more to ideology than to nationality.  Such results may help shed light on potential directions that may be fruitful for more European integration."

"This thesis focuses on the experimental approach used by J-PAL's researchers in development economics. The goal of these researchers is twofold: (1) producing evidence concerning the efficiency of development programs, (2) in order to guide policy decisions. The aim of this thesis is to conduct an epistemological analysis of the J-PAL's approach. This analysis studies two dimensions: a methodological one and a theoretical one. The methodological dimension aims to question the method used by the J-PAL: randomization. Two main questions guide this methodological analysis: (1) randomization's methodological status of «gold standard », (2) and the possibility to transpose the results obtained by the J-P AL in the political area. The second, theoretical, dimension questions the J-PAL's contributions to the (theoretical) debates within development economics over the past ten years. The study of these two dimensions allows an examination of the J-PAL's approach as a whole. The thesis shows that the results of this approach have a strong internal validity at the expense of a weak external validity. This makes the use of such results in the political area difficult. This tension between internal validity and external validity points out the antagonism of the J-PAL's two objectives and defines an epistemological issue: the refusal of a theory along with the lack of emphasis on the underlying mechanisms of the J-PAL's results prevents it from producing clear political recommendations."
"The starting point of this PhD dissertation is related to the Shimer puzzle, i.e. the unability of the search and matching model to reproduce the high volatility of the unemployment rate. Real wage rigidities were considered as the main solution to this puzzle. Nevertheless, Sveen and Weinke (2008) argue that those rigidities would not have any impact on the unemployment volatility when hours per worker are determined by the firms. In the first chapter, we argue that the capacity of real wage rigidities to solve the puzzle critically depends on the way that rigidities are introduced. When real wage stickiness results from the «credible bargaining» (Hall and Milgrom ,2008), we show that the unemployment volatility is magnified, even for hours being firms’ decisions. A significant stabilization trade-off  between  inflation and unemployment is moreover restituted. However, we stress in the second chapter that the credible bargaining delivers a moderate degree of wage rigidity and then requires unrealistic values for some  parameters to completely replicate the unemployment volatility. We integrate asymmetric information into this framework and show that the resulting higher wage stickiness fully reproduces the volatility for a plausible calibration. ln the last chapter, we emphasize that it is possible to solve the puzzle without resting on real wage stickiness, by considering a particular calibration of the model with endogenous separations. We also highlight a central mechanism of this framework, for which the volatility of the separation rate amplifies that of the job finding rate."
"Over the April-June 2008 period, prices of the commodities such as wheat, maize, rice and vegetable oils, reached impressive yet not exceptional peaks. By contrast, the populations of 48 countries were stricken by severe under nutrition. Most of them had already been weakened not only by conflicts, social disorders, dramatic and unusual climatic and natural disasters, but also by outbreaks, epizooties, and population displacements. In some cases, all these factors together played a significant role in the worsening situation. However, another important reason could be advanced to explain why the 2008 food crisis was an “extraordinary problem”. This one is that “normal” scientific knowledge was defeated by the complexity of what it appears now as a food “poly-crises” (Morin, 2011). We answered by designing an epistemological, methodological, and technical knowledge base from two very different and alternative economics approaches of facing complexity. The first is the Hayekian approach (1899-1992), and the second, the Simonian approach (1916-2001). The research intends to fulfill cumulativity criteria, traditionally difficult to satisfy with the ones of complexity. From the following analysis we mostly learned two things. First, epistemological grounds of economics needed to be broken in complex environment(s): 1) from certainty/objectivity to uncertainty/subjectivity, 2) from accurate prediction to design, 3) from linear causality deemed inappropriate or, worse, threatening people freedoms, to complex causality. Second, in the adaptation process, the role of “tacit” knowledge production and sharing is central. For that reason, the core of economics problem is not allocation of resources anymore. Now, the main problem for humans whose cognitive capacity are “bounded” is to compute, to “socialize” (Nonaka et alii, 1994, 2001), available but dispersed information and knowledge and to converse them into heuristics or patterns allowing the adaptation to complex and uncertain environment(s). Two others auxiliary hypotheses –E. Ostrom (2011) will endorse them later- can be drawn from that preliminary work: 1) the dynamics of change rooted “in the thinking and in the creativity of people involved in complex situations and their capacity to restructure their own models for interactions”, 2) reciprocal altruism (Simon, 1992, 1993) is a rational behavior which can be more effective in/for the social interactions in complex environment(s) than maximizing or selfish behavior. To present preliminary results in an effective way, we created a very simple interface scheme. It takes the form of a three-dimensional knowledge loop with two strands, “generic” and “tacit” knowledge connected between themselves to produce by recursion a meta-knowledge. We made the choice of the interface because it reflects with the most accuracy the position defended by Hayek and Simon which is that economics is a frontier science. Moreover, the interface has the advantage of being both open and closed. A part of the research is more specifically dedicated to design tools increasing the understanding of the “polyfood” crises. We elaborated a three-level indicator with: 1) perceptions of the contribution of each factor to the outbreak and the worsening of the situation; 2) contributions of actors to the explanation of the food crisis proposed in 2008. It was developed from: 1) a case study comparing and contrasting explanations proposed a) in their statements by 138 Heads of State and Government attended the High Level Conference on World Food Security (3-5 June 2008), b) in their analyses by economists, c) in their testimonies by people hit by under nutrition/rising food prices (database IRIN); 2) a new and more updated typology focused on the responses addressed by 18 countries split into 3 groups [...]."
"The concept of Mobility as a Service (MaaS) has become widespread in Western countries and has become a solid market option, presenting a transport system offer based no longer on ownership but use. This approach places the user at the heart of urban mobility issues, so consumers must be open to adopting new technologies and services, such as autonomous vehicles. Based on our research, this Ph.D. thesis aims to analyze the concept of MaaS in order to identify the conditions for its implementation and diffusion in tomorrow's urban mobility. We found that to take a sustainable place in the urban mobility system, MaaS must be considered as a modular and adaptable business model applicable to all socio-political, regulatory, environmental, and economic contexts. To this end, the business model of this innovative ecosystem must take into account consumer acceptance, coordination of the multiple actors making up the value chain within a MaaS and existing transport systems that are specific with their development of technological."
"This research work focuses on new forms of partnership governance and not just shareholder governance driven by Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approaches. These forms of governance notably question the management of human resources and the participation practices implemented with regard to employees. Indeed, it is through direct or indirect individual participation, through employee representatives, that employees can make their demands heard and express their needs and expectations within the company. Participation practices would thus contribute to the implementation of socially responsible behavior just as CSR would contribute to responsible management by taking into account the stakeholders.Therefore, the question is whether companies engaged in CSR, and particularly in its social aspect, implement concrete practices in favor of their employees through different forms of participation. In other words, it is about highlighting the link between participation practices and CSR.The work is based on a survey conducted in Luxembourg SMEs. Logistic regression models show that CSR in the social domain is positively associated with the use of participatory HRM practices by SMEs. On the other hand, the link between bargaining practices with employee representatives and CSR practices seems less close. While CSR does not promote negotiation, it nevertheless seems to favor the consultation of employee representatives. Also, the CSR commitment of SMEs associated with participatory HRM practices, does not indicate that these practices replace representative participation. This work highlights rather the complementarity of different participation and expression practices as part of CSR activity."
"This thesis focuses on work performance, or in other words how work contributes to an organization’s performance. This topic has received little attention in the literature. However, the literature shows the complexity surrounding the notions of work and performance. Therefore, the question that this thesis seeks to answer is exploratory and methodological: ""How to account for work performance within organisations?” This thesis adopts an interdisciplinary approach. It combines ergonomics and management control. The thesis develops an original, analytical framework aimed at understanding work performance using common categories in management control (discourse, measures, managerial practices) and in ergonomics (activity).The analytical framework structures the data collection methodology, which mainly relies on semi-structured interviews, documents, non-participatory observations and verbalizations. The first case study focuses on the performance of salespeople work in airports’ duty-free shops. The second case study focuses on the work performance of workers in an industrial SME.We show that using the analytical framework enables us to account for work performance and underscore the often implicit and divergent dimensions of how work contributes to organisational performance. We also highlight that the actors’ representations of work performance are partially independent of those conveyed by the measures. Finally, the thesis demonstrates that work and its performance are a legitimate and relevant research object in management control."
"This thesis investigates whether individuals use their memory as a self-deceptive strategy to sustain motivated beliefs. It tests experimentally the existence and strength of memory manipulation in three economically relevant contexts: social interactions, individual performance and unethical decisions.Chapter one investigates whether people retrieve their memory self-servingly in social encounters. Do individuals forget the consequences of their actions on others? If so, does it depend on the nature (e.g. selfish or altruistic) of the action? Our results identify a causal effect of the responsibility of pro-social decisions on selective recalls. In contrast, there is no clear evidence of biased memory errors. Chapter two disentangles between two driving forces that have been proposed as explanations of memory failures for self-relevant information: self-enhancement and mood-congruency. We provide a controlled environment where the two theories predict different outcomes. Our results provide support for the existence and relative dominance of self-enhancing memory over mood-congruent memory and thereby underline the importance of motivational factors in the formation of optimistic beliefs about the self.Chapter three investigates the relative role of affect and strategic reasoning in motivated memory, with an application in the domain of unethical behavior. We study whether individuals manipulate the memory of past dishonest choices, and whether they use their memory as an instrument to justify future decisions. We find that hedonic considerations are not sufficient to trigger memory manipulation. When forgetting serves as a justification to not engage in future morally responsible behavior, however, individuals do motivate their memory.Together, these results show that memory errors in economic contexts can result from cognitive impairment but also from memory distortion motivated by the willingness to protect one's self-image and future choices."
"Originally conceived and implemented by the airline industry in the United States, revenue management pricing (RMP) has grown in popularity in hotels and other service industries across the world. Revenue management has become an essential strategic tool in capacity constrained service industries whose total revenue often depends on the ability of firms to use capacity efficiently. However, despite its economic benefit, the RMP is not always well accepted by consumers, who may consider the practice as unfair. Based on the justice theory, this doctoral research has two main goals. First, this study has developed a scale to measure revenue management perceived unfairness in line with the procedures recommended in the literature. Second, the goal is to test a pool of strategies to help firms limit negative reactions and increase the willingness to pay (WTP). In order to measure the concept of perceived unfairness of revenue management and validate a new model of fairness based pricing (FBP), a lexicometric study and three quantitative samples (N1: 343, N2: 325, N3: 490) were conducted. Tested with the Partial Least Squares Path modeling (PLSPM) algorithm and the importance-performance map (IPMA), the model showing that respecting the principles of equity and transparency helps to reduce perceived unfairness and predict the WTP in the context of RMP. The results of this thesis should help capacity-constrained services companies improve their RMP."
"The determinants of asset returns remain an active research topic in the financial literature. This thesis focuses on the role of certain risk factors, of the asymmetry of the distribution of returns and of the investment horizon as determinants of asset returns. We first demonstrate that the size effect can be considered partially due to specific industries that are considered statistically relevant to explain the performance of the portfolios of small (big) firms and we study the empirical implications of this finding in terms of asset pricing. We then consider the relationship between the market and the main risk factors proposed in the literature – including the factor SMB that explicitly accounts for the size effect – and point out that the considered factors can be partially explained by a non-linear relation with the market factor. In addition, we show that exploiting the non-linear relationship between the market and these risk factors can be profitable in terms of investmentstrategies. The last part of this thesis focuses on the issue of time diversification and analyses the impact of the horizon on the properties of the compounded return distributions to show that the compounding effect is the main reason for the shapeof the long-term return distributions. We then shed new light on the divergences of opinion expressed in the literature regarding long-term investment strategies."
"Hidden costs limit the reduction of GHG emissions associated to agricultural productions. Uncertainty is inherent in farmers’ production decisions, and impact them through different drivers: beliefs, risk, information, ambiguity, are just as many elements that can limit the spread of mitigation practices in the agricultural sector. In this thesis, we first present a complete literature review about agri-environmental measures and the diverse approaches of uncertainty in microeconomics and agricultural economics. We then develop a model of adoption decision showing that 3 hidden costs associated to uncertainty can prevent new practices’ adoption in a non-additive way and coexist (option value, risk premium, informational externalities), so that the regulator must socialize them in order to reduce GHG emissions. Then, we implement a land conversion model and extent it in an empirical estimation strategy of the impact of herb yields volatility on the shadow value of grasslands in the French forage mix. The multinomial logistic model is estimated through an instrumental approach using meteorological data. Finally, we make a survey of a sample of farmers in order to measure their attitudes towards risk and ambiguity (Multiple price list) and estimate their impact on nitrogen fertilization decisions, according to the whole application and the splitting practice."
"This thesis analyses the process of territorial qualification of agro-food products, by studying the role of geographical indications (GI) in this process, in Indonesia and Vietnam. We interrogate the objectives and the economic conditions of the development of GIs, by combining the economics of quality and territories. Three types of conditions are questioned, through the analysis of (1) the specificity of products, (2) the territorial coordinations and the organization of local actors, and (3) the State’s role. The comparison of the Indonesian and Vietnamese GI systems, confronted with the economic model of GIs, highlights the important role of the States, which goes beyond the legal protection of GIs and gather several functions (selection of products, funding, expertise, monitoring after registration). The parallel analysis of six local GI experiences demonstrates, first, that GIs are be registered at various stages of the ongoing process of territorial qualification (advanced, intermediate or recent) and that the moment of the GI establishment conditions the construction of the local institutional device. Secondly, our field research underlines the importance of the economic context of supply-chains and the influence of local sociopolitical configurations during the emergence of GIs, questioning the capacity of these local institutional devices to balance the power between stakeholders. The study of the various roles of central States and local governments in the emerging GI dynamics opens perspectives of analysis of the interactions between GIs, public intervention, decentralization and opportunities for local organization and collective action. The evolution of the institutionalization process of the link to origin through GIs in both countries appears contingent upon several elements, including a larger participation of producers to the local GI dynamics, an active role of the local agricultural services and a broad engagement of buyers."

"This thesis makes use of some theoretical tools in finance, decision theory, machine learning, to improve the design, pricing and hedging of insurance contracts. Chapter 3 develops closed-form pricing formulas for participating life insurance contracts, based on matrix Wiener-Hopf factorization, where multiple risk sources, such as credit, market, and economic risks, are considered. The pricing method proves to be accurate and efficient. The dynamic and semi-static hedging strategies are introduced to assist insurance company to reduce risk exposure arising from the issue of participating contracts. Chapter 4 discusses the optimal contract design when the insured is third degree risk averse. The results showthat dual limited stop-loss, change-loss, dual change-loss, and stop-loss can be optimal contracts favord by both of risk averters and risk lovers in different settings. Chapter 5 develops a stochastic gradient boosting frequency-severity model, which improves the important and popular GLM and GAM frequency-severity models. This model fully inherits advantages ofgradient boosting algorithm, overcoming the restrictive linear or additive forms of the GLM and GAM frequency-severity models, through learning the model structure from data. Further, our model can also capture the flexible nonlinear dependence between claim frequency and severity"
"As African organizations operate according to universal principles (Western) while such principles often ignore African specificities, this study proposes to relate Western theory to African specificities. This doctoral study examines a Western model, the Mitchell and al. (1997)’s model, applied to the governance of microfinance organizations in Senegal. Many researches explain that microfinance organizations’ problems are related to corporate governance difficulties. Moreover, most studies consider that the concept of stakeholder is the foundation of the governance of microfinance organizations. Finally, the model of Mitchelland al. (1997) is cited as one of the most relevant typologies in the stakeholder theory literature. The objective of this thesis is to integrate Senegalese traditional and cultural specificities in the model of Mitchell et al. (1997) applied to the governance of microfinance organizations in Senegal. From a qualitative study based on 24 interviews conducted with the leaders of microfinance organizations in Senegal in the Dakar region, we highlight that Western theories, in particular the model of Mitchell et al. (1997) can only be understood inside an institutional context linked to a territory, the tradition that is exercised there and the specificactors that make it live. In addition, taking into account the traditional and local aspects leads to a new thinking of both the role of microfinance organizations (value creation and distribution of the surplus) and the control mechanisms that are to be implemented to limit patronage drift or misappropriation of funds."
"The medico-social sector in France is a sector that help and support people in vulnerable situation. This sector concerns in particular people with disabilities (PWD). Depending on the disability, PWH may require adapted medico-social support that helps them living almost like any other person. Different social and medico-social institutions (SMSI) provide these supports. If the person wishes to access this support, it must address a request to the Departmental House of Disabled People (DHDP). A multidisciplinary team (MT) analyses the request and proposes to the person a list of SMSI considered appropriate to the person's situation. This process is called the orientation process for PWD and presents several problems that this thesis seeks to solve. The current process is often too long and sometimes does not always formulate applicable solutions. Some people may stay without support for several years. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the orientation process based on a change in the orientation policy. Instead of proposing a list of institutions from which the person has to choose one (disability-institution policy), we propose a list of services from different SMSI capable of meeting the identified needs (needs-services policy). The list of services can be provided by one or several MSI. In order to shift towards a needs-services policy, we propose a method for modelling complex processes involving autonomous actors. This method was used to model the orientation process to analyse problems, causes and find improvement opportunities. We then proposed a service characterization approach (qualitative and quantitative aspects) in order to identify the dimensions that defines a service. This approach was used in the characterization of medico-social services for the needs-service policy. Finally, we propose an assignment model using a sliding horizon mixed-integer linear formulation. This model proposes an orientation according to the needs-services policy. This model has been tested with representative data of different SMSI that help us to identify and propose better organizational practices for the orientation process."
"This dissertation deals with how regions’ knowledge expertise affects the innovative performance in the region and contributes to the literature of regional innovation systems. The first chapter relies on the literature of regional innovation systems that underlines the role of spatial proximity on local innovative activities. Within the regional structure, two interconnected subsystems are well studied by scholars recently the knowledge-generation and the knowledge exploitation. I question traditional measurements and point out the limitations of current studies. I highlight the dynamics of regional knowledge subsystems as well as their relative relationships. I further suggest the new measurments of these knowledge subsystems at the finer-grained layers (i.e. different types of expertise in science and technology) by using a unique dataset of French patents and scientific publications (1990-2015), then examine their relationships with regional R&D expenditure. The results show that R&D expenditure has a positive relationship with the numbers of the scientific and technological expertise of the region; however, not to the level of expertise. I also show that the level of technological expertise will increase if it is complementary to a specific science. The second essay deals with the time value of local scientific expertise. In this study, we particularly extend the well-known literature of localized knowledge diffusion. We argue that local scientific expertise closely aligned with local industry enhances the ability of proximate inventors to recognize, access and acquire the potential scientific materials, particularly scientific publications, that favour for their innovation activities. As a result, it helps to reduce the time for local inventors to reference to scientific publications, hence increase the value of the invention. We measure the time lag between the published year of cited publications and citing patent to captures the fast diffusion of knowledge from scientific publication to the invention. The values of the focal innovation is captured by the direct and the multi-generational forward citation counts. The paper may help the scholar to better understand the different mechanisms for the diffusion of knowledge and/or interplay between science, innovation and technological progress. The third essay focuses on the region as a critical source for local inventors/firms by providing them with higher innovative capacities. We particularly elaborate on the concept of regional alignment by replying on the regional platform of knowledge systems. We take the view of knowledge generation that inventors combine different elements of knowledge to create an invention. During search process, inventors face different barriers and risks. We argue that the regional alignment as the effectiveness of knowledge platforms, which reflects potential synergies between complementary and heterogeneous knowledge expertise, competences and local actors. These synergies facilitate interactive learning, thus increase absorptive capacities to local actors. As a result, regional alignment may mitigate the risk and uncertainty of knowledge creation. These results show that regional alignment provides local actors with higher explorative capabilities to search and evaluate the distant knowledge, which helps to reduce variance and increase the usefulness of their explorative innovations."
"This thesis proposes an analysis of the triangle formed by monetary policy, prudential policy and bank’s risk-taking. Accordingly, this thesis aims to study the effects of monetary policy on banks’ risk-taking and to determine the conditions for monetary and prudential policy coordination in order to ensure the stability of the banking sector and the solvency of financial institutions. At the macroeconomic level, we also assess the impact of this coordination on domestic credit and on the expected cost of bank failure. The first chapter reviews the literature on theoretical and empirical analysis of the risk-taking channel, and the analysis of the issue of monetary policy coordination with prudential policy. This literature review reveals that the effects of monetary policy on bank risk-taking are not one-sided, calling into question our knowledge of the monetary risk-taking channel. Similarly, this chapter suggests that the nature of monetary and prudential policy coordination is not unique. The second chapter is devoted to an original empirical study on the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. Using a panel threshold model, we show that monetary policy has different effects depending on the ""monetary regime"" in which monetary policy is conducted. Thus, a fall in interest rates leads to more risk-taking if monetary policy is considered loose (interest rate below the Taylor rule rate). Conversely, when monetary policy is considered as restrictive (interest rate above Taylor’s rule rate), a decrease in interest rate reduces banks risk level. The third chapter examines the impact of monetary policy on bank’s risk according to the nature of prudential policy. Using a partial equilibrium model, we determine conditions under which monetary policy, in presence of a risk sensitive capital requirement ratio, would lead the bank to take more risk. The results show that the effects of monetary policy on banking risk are not independent of the nature of microprudential policy. The objectives of financial stability and reduction of the cost of a bank failure, taken together, makes it possible to identify situations in which it is necessary to complement the microprudential tool with a macroprudential one. However, macroprudential intervention, which comes at the expense of financing the economy, is not always effective in limiting the costs of bank failure."
"Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a major evolution for the current organizations in the economic sector. At the heart of a modern ever-changing society, the notion of responsibility takes a central place in the design and implementation of the action. The economic and managerial dimensions of CSR initiatives undertaken by companies are thus the subject of numerous studies, but these initiatives remain poorly surveyed concerning their unique socio-cultural dimension.This doctoral work examines the implications of the introduction of discourse and practices of CSR on employees of companies in the retail sector. The emergence of a social paradigm of responsibility, which involves a set of values and beliefs across a society, requires these individuals to overcome the paradigmatic challenge of responsibility; they can then incorporate this sense of responsibility into the heart of the ideals and actions of their daily work. In this context, the organization provides a singular accompanying role for the individual's experience by providing a variety of supports, but also by upholding major boundaries derived from fundamental organizational ethos and established structures.The qualitative study conducted around the thorough analysis of forty-two semi-structured interviews and an extensive documentation study, shows how the individual becomes the custodian of the heavy burden of enacting in his work, the social and macro-social issues of developments of the paradigmatic world of the society in which he participates."
"This research focuses on actors organized at the local level in order to struggle systems and practices oriented by capital accumulation. It observes the ability of individuals to produce value-based organizations and the structuring between pragmatic issues and actors’ values. This research is drawing on alternative organizations studies (Parker et al, 2014) and tries to answer the following questions: does the rationalization of the organization necessarily lead to the degeneration of values? What are the organizational conditions of social actions based on value? Do they generate an alternative form of legitimate order? In order to investigate these issues, the research studies on two alternative organizations located in the city of Montpellier. First the « Graine », a local currency that aims to provide an alternative to national currencies and globalized exchanges. Then the « Boat In a Bag », a group of hackers gathered within a common space to provide technological emancipation tools and a common space for free expression. Both stories are written from within, following an ethnographic methodology (Van Maanen, 1979). Accordingly, the qualitative analysis of 41 interviews has been associated with a daily involvement within both organizations, from November 2015 to June 2018. Thus, the case study of these two alternative value-based organizations deals with issues of hierarchy, rationalization, and new organizational principles built around the Do-It-Ocracy."
"Long considered to be exclusively focused on their craft and production, artisans demonstrate today their openness to their business environment and their ability to develop their activity and brand from the point of view of consumers. The aim of this research is to determine whether the development of the artisan’s business, through branding and marketing actions, causes them to lose what makes their essence and values in the eyes of the consumers. A literature review and a series of qualitative studies (focus group, semi-structured interviews, ZMET technique) allow us to better understand the consumer’s perceptions of the artisan and highlight the interest of the concept of artisan brand. In addition, a series of experiments were conducted to measure the impact of the personification and marketing orientation of the artisan’s store name on consumer reactions. The results show the mediating role of perceived warmth and competence of the artisan and the consumer’s identification with the store and the artisan. Finally, testing several scenarios of artisan business development, a last experimentation highlights the positive reactions toward the creation of an artisan brand, and the choice of marketing orientation but also some mistrust about the increase of the size of the business."
"A wide range of organizations are pursuing economic performance objectives in various organizational contexts. However, in parallel with their continued economic performance some of them pursue performance objectives of social utility.Our research is organized around three articles that analyze, independently from each other, several governance or management systems whose respective deployments have effects on economic performance and social utility performance that some organizations set as objectives to be achieved simultaneously, and which may generate new tensions between logics.Our results shed light on how specific management tools influence the articulation of different logics and can support a militant structure in its pursuit of social utility objectives and legitimize, internally, its action. They also show the relative impact of new legislative and regulatory constraints on the governance of mutual insurance companies and, consequently, on the tensions between the approaches they pursue simultaneously. They also bring out the strong links that exist between different populations, each with its own logic within the same organization, when it comes to the type of management of one.We show that an organization of the social economy is not reduced to its status, or even to its original hybridity, and that it can carry an integrative logic of ""common well-being"", qualified as a policy in this research, because it wants to simultaneously achieve social, societal, economic and environmental performance objectives.We also provide elements that allow a better understanding of the posture of researcher - observer - participant."
"The limits of conventional approaches to the study ot‘ management acoounting in the public hospital are related to the assumptions underlying these approaches and to the speciﬁcities ot‘ the public hospital. particularly with regard to its public service stator and the nature ot' his activity. The practical approach allows to overcome the diﬂîculties opposed to classical approaches by emphasizing the role of context, actors and their practices for the study of management accounting. The mobilization of the practical approach for the study of management accounting at the hospital makes it possible t0 build a cartography of the practices composing a social system like the hospital. This thesis makes contributions on how management accounting is inﬂuenced by context. It also discusses the importance of considering how management accounting practices ﬁt into operational practices. The study of the articulation of management accounting practices and operational practices justiﬁes the importance of the role played by the operational actors in the achicvement of hospital and management accouting objectives in terms of efﬁciency, effectiveness and economy. The resuits of this thesis demonstrate the role that interna! and external interactions play in achieving the strategic objectives of a management acoounting system. The methodological contributions of thesis concern the compiementarity between the researcher‘s experience and the mobilization of the practical approach. At the managerial ievel, this thesis attempts to provide an answer to the difﬁculties of implementing management accounting at the hospital."
"Car use declining in the last decade has created reflections on the reasons of this new trend of mobility. In France, the explanations focus on non spatial variables like rising of fuel price, age effect, generation effect… while abroad the redistribution of population between cities and within cities is considered as an important aspect of the car use declining. With the annual time series data on fiscal households and survey on households mobility provided by ParcAuto, we analyze the impact of metropolization and urban sprawl on car use. For that purpose, we have constructed some categorical sizes of metropolitan area and some urban development forms with the evolution of distribution of households between the dense municipalities and periphery part of these metropolitan areas. The results show that the vehicle kilometer declines significantly in large urban perimeter than medium and small one. On the other hand, slow urban sprawl residents use fewer cars than those living in rapid metropolitan area households. In the small metropolitan areas, the level of household growth can’t differentiate the travel behavior of the inhabitants. However, those living in large metropolitan area commute longer distance by car than those living in medium and small metropolitan areas. These results encourage urban renewal politics in central cities and recommend reducing investment in housing in the outskirt"
"Long memory, also called long range dependence (LRD), is commonly detected in the analysis of real-life time series data in many areas; for example, in finance, in econometrics, in hydrology, etc. Therefore the study of long-memory time series is of great value. The introduction of ARFIMA (fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average) process established a relationship between the fractional integration and long memory, and this model has found its power in long-term forecasting, hence it has become one of the most popular long-memory models in the statistical literature. Specifically, an ARFIMA(p,d,q) process X, is defined as follows: cD(B)(I - B)d X, = 8(B)c, , where cD(z)=l-~lz-•••-~pzP and 8(z)=1-B1z- .. •-Bqzq are polynomials of order $ p $ and $ q $, respectively, with roots outside the unit circle; and c, is Gaussian white noise with a constant variance a2 . When c"" X, is stationary and invertible. However, the a priori assumption on stationarity of real-life data is not reasonable. Therefore many statisticians have made their efforts to propose estimators applicable to the non-stationary case. Then questions arise that which estimator should be chosen for applications; and what we should pay attention to when using these estimators. Therefore we make a comprehensive finite sample comparison of semi-parametric Fourier and wavelet estimators under the non-stationary ARFIMA setting. ln light of this comparison study, we have that (i) without proper scale trimming the wavelet estimators are heavily biased and the y generally have an inferior performance to the Fourier ones; (ii) ail the estimators under investigation are robust to the presence of a linear time trend in levels of XI and the GARCH effects in variance of XI; (iii) the consistency of the estimators still holds in the presence of regime switches in levels of XI , however, it tangibly contaminates the estimation results. Moreover, the log-regression wavelet estimator works badly in this situation with small and medium sample sizes; and (iv) fully-extended local polynomial Whittle Fourier (fextLPWF) estimator is preferred for a practical utilization, and the fextLPWF estimator requires a wider bandwidth than the other Fourier estimators."
"The development of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) is hampered by several barriers: form economical, technical to organizational and financial, the hurdles are numerous. This thesis attempts to answer some issues related to the socio-economic aspects of SDIs. It focuses on several topics concerning the SDI economic valuation and impact measurement. The aim has been fivefold: i) to propose a business model for this particular type of infrastructure in order to meet a sustainable financing scheme; ii) to perform an economic valuation of the geospatial information available through the SDI platform, the high resolution (HR) satellite images; iii) to examine the role of a SDI as an information structure; iv) to identify the economic impacts of a SDI; v) to study the stability of the satellite image markets through a SDI.In this thesis, a challenge consisted of approaching the business models field into the implementation of SDIs. The relevance of a two-sided market approach for analyzing a SDI dynamics was tested through a platform management process, in order for a SDI to transition to a self-sustaining funding mechanism. We explained how a SDI through its platform could ensure continuous interaction between the different components, represented by the developers of spatial data applications and the potential users of such data.It was important that the economic valuation questions concerning the SDI, need to be refined in parallel with the reflections about the business model of this type of infrastructure. In our context, we examined the economic value of the HR satellite images as perceived by the direct users of a SDI platform. The valuation study came to assess the importance of the satellite imagery as a support for the territorial planning and development economics. In a context of open and distributed innovation within the networks, it offered elements allowing to establish pricing scenarios on a next level, in order to sustain the SDI platform business model in the long run.In addition, we examined the role of a SDI as an information structure. We applied our findings to the clear-cut forest control case in France. Based on heterogeneous information received, we elaborated a decision-making policy in order to help a decision maker better model his decision. An original approach was introduced, articulating between two existing theories: the classic method of Blackwell and the Entropy theory. We advanced a two-level methodological context: The choice of the information structure with the most informative power and the detection of the optimal action.Similarly, by considering the clear cut example, we analyzed the socio-economic impacts of a SDI based on satellite imagery. A detailed analysis of the geospatial information acquired through the SDI, allowed to characterize the public policies involved in this field, in order to examine the impacts related the SDI ecosystem. In a second step, some of these impacts have been assessed in more details.Finally, these valuation studies opened a window to examine the market demand stability through the SDI. The spatial data infrastructures, which constitute the direct link between the users and the large Earth Observation (EO) industry, have a leading role in establishing market opportunities. While the users are becoming primary key-drivers for spatial data technology, they contribute through their demand of raw data and services, to its development and growth. We approached the stability of different satellite image markets through two independent French SDIs, by using the Records theory. We implemented an innovative method and provided additional elements for a better comprehension of the EO data management."
"This thesis focuses on the question of the information transmitted to consumers by the markets and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) on the environmental quality of products. This work takes place in a context where, on one hand, consumers' awareness increase concerning this dimension, and on the other hand, firms increasingly display a social or environmental responsibility whose reality is often contested. The first paper investigates the role of price as a possible substitute channel of communication. The purpose is to examine how a green firm competing against a brown firm can solve the asymmetric information issue. For this purpose, we develop a simple vertically differentiated duopoly model where firms can signal their quality through prices. To represent an increasing pressure of the competition on the low-quality segment, we make the hypothesis that the brown good is sold at the marginal cost. The result is extreme: there do not exist any situations where the green firm can solve the asymmetric information issue. The second paper takes into account the informative role of NGOs concerning the type of firms. We are interested in how their informational behavior impacts the signaling strategy of firms. The interaction between the price signaling strategy of the firm and the information released by the NGO yield fruitful results concerning the path of green information.When consumers cannot verify corporate social goodwill, firms may be reluctant to uphold a pledge of social goodwill. We show how imperfect monitoring can mitigate this moral hazard problem.  We augment the standard model of price signaling by allowing consumers to use the results of independent monitoring as a complementary source of information. Monitoring corrects for consumers' arbitrary beliefs. Before sending a price signal to consumers, firms pledge or not to invest in social goodwill.With no monitoring, firms do not abide by their pledges of social goodwill when they fail to send a credible signal via price.With monitoring, there exist equilibria in which a firm invests in social goodwill and succeeds in signaling its choice via price.It is worth mentioning that the hard evidence displayed by NGOs can be of two different natures. In this Chapter, the types of discovered evidence go in pairs with shaming and championing strategies. In this spirit, we endogenize the signaling choice of the NGO, which interacts with the signaling strategy of a firm. We seek to analyze the effect of these two different strategies on the equilibrium of signaling of the firm and the optimal informative behavior of the NGO.The technology choice here is exogenous, and the consumer is perfectly Bayesian according to the two different signals received. Either a proof discredits the firm, or a proof accredits the firm. We find that the shaming strategy reduces the signaling cost for the high type and can even restore the perfect information outcome. The championing strategy can make incentives for the market to reveal the truth disappear. Concerning the optimal informative behavior of the NGO, if the market reveals information, the NGO is indifferent between adopting a shaming strategy and adopting a championing strategy. When the market conceals information, the strategy depends on the difference between the shaming and championing efficiency and the distribution of the firm in the market."
"The cooperation, and through it the creation and distribution of added value in inter-organizational cooperation systems, is a response increasingly used by companies and organizations as a new conception of their economic space. In this context, this new form of ""productive order"" is a real Trojan horse to capture, create and distribute new resources and maintain competitive advantages. Our research work focuses on the situations of inter-organizational cooperation (SCIO) and more particularly on the creation and distribution of added value (CRVA), in a sense dedicated to piloting.This thesis is based on three socio-economic research-intervention case studies (a longitudinal case and two complementary cases), enriched by in-depth interviews with their leaders. It studies the management of CRVA-SCIO, in order to understand the logics of construction and organization of cooperation situations, explains the measurement and evaluation of individual and collective performance and proposes an operational management model, connected to all interfaces , working with an open-ended approach and proposing innovative tools and indicators to make cooperation effective and sustainable. The challenge of our research is first and foremost at the academic level to give a contribution to the theoretical evolution of management control of inter-organizational systems. Then, at the managerial level, to make a contribution to the leaders and managers in order to renovate and develop their system of management of inter-organizational configurations."
"The main objective of this thesis is to understand the various aspects of market impact. It consists of four chapters in which the market impact is studied in different contexts and at different scales. The first chapter presents an empirical study of the market impact of limit orders on European equity markets. In the second chapter, we have extended the methodology presented for the equity markets to the options markets. This empirical study has shown that our definition of an options metaorder allows us to retrieve all the results highlighted on the equity markets. The third chapter focuses on market impact in the context of option pricing. This chapter is based on previous works of option pricing with market impact and attempts to bring a microstructure component to pricing option theory by proposing a perturbation theory of market impact during the re-hedging process. We explore in the fourth chapter a fairly simple model for the relaxation of metaorders. The relaxation of metaorders is treated in this part as an informational process which is transmitted to the market. Thus, starting from the starting point that at the end of the execution of a metaorder the information carried by this one is maximum, we propose an interpretation of the relaxation phenomenon as being the result of the degradation of this information at the expense of outside market noise."
"Standard economic models assume that individuals collect and process information in a way that gives them a relatively accurate perception of reality. However, this assumption is often violated. Data shows that individuals often form positively biased beliefs about themselves, which can have detrimental economic con-sequences. This thesis aims to explain the persistence of overconfidence in social interactions by showing the existence of strategic benefits of being overconfident that offset its social cost.Using a series of laboratory experiments, this thesis shows that (i) overconfidence emerges primarily when it provides an advantage in social interactions (Chapter2) and (ii) identify situations in which overconfidence is likely to be socially detrimental (Chapter 3 and 4). This thesis contributes to the literature by enhancing our understanding of the situational determinants of overconfidence in social interactions and lay the foundations to improve policies intended to prevent or limit its negative effects"
"This Ph.D. dissertation aims at providing new conceptual and formal tools in order to model preference changes. To do so, I model a mechanism that I refer to as partial deliberation. Partial deliberation is based on the idea that individuals change their preference by becoming aware of new values. Indeed, their awareness allows them either to reject values they were adhering to or to adopt new values. By critically analysis of the literature on preference changes and on rational choice theory, the introduction emphasizes the main philosophical issues of partial deliberation. The first chapter justifies the five psychological hypotheses on which this mechanism relies and discusses their relation with rational choice theory. The second chapter axiomatically deals with partial deliberation and it formalizes two specific structures : a monotonic structure and partitional structure.Then, the third chapter models a situation of preference manipulation, in which a sender jointly chooses a project and a disclosure strategy in order to manipulate the preference of a receiver. With this model, I account for imperfect empathy and sequential disclosure of values."
"This thesis consists of four chapters on income distribution. All chapters are interrelated, and cohesively they serve the sole purpose of discussing the concept of income composition inequality. This concept is thoroughly explored from a conceptual, mathematical, as well as political economy perspective. Chapter 1 introduces this dissertation and its main findings. Chapter 2 presents the concept of income composition inequality, together with a summary statistics for its technical assessment. Chapter 3 analyzes the determinants of income inequality variation in light of the novel inequality dimension previously introduced. Chapter 4 studies the evolution of income composition inequality in Italy between 1989 and 2016. Chapter 5 proposes a method to jointly analyze the distributions of capital and labor and of saving and consumption across the population. This method hinges on the concept of income composition inequality. Finally, Chapter 6 concludes this dissertation and lays the ground for future research on the matter."
"This PhD dissertation provides empirical evidence on many aspects of the volume-outcome relationship with regard to cancer care. In the first chapter, we explore the relationship between hospital volume activities and patient outcomes for ovarian cancer care. Using a wide-ranging set of clinical characteristics depicting patients’ degree of illness, we identified a strong volume-outcome relationship, with substantial differences in survival between patients treated in high volume and in low volume hospitals. In the second chapter, we look in more depth into what underlies the observed hospital volume-outcome relationship. More specifically, we provide evidence on the contribution of clinician decisions (i.e., which drive patient care pathways) to the causal impact of hospital volume on patient outcomes. Our findings substantiate the contribution of clinician decisions regarding the treatment option to the causal impact of hospital volume on patient outcomes, thereby offering a better understanding of this complex relationship. In chapter 3, we use a nationwide administrative dataset to evaluate the impact that centralization of care for breast cancer and ovarian cancer treatment has on spatial and socioeconomic inequalities in access to specialized care. Our findings indicate a strong and highly unequally distributed deterioration in patient access to specialized care, which highlights a major adverse consequence of such a policy. From a broader perspective, there is a need to understand the mechanisms of patient referral to hospitals to better understand the potential necessity of centralized care. The fourth chapter of this thesis provides evidence of patient preferences for cancer care using a revealed preferences framework, taking into account that patient choice sets are actually unobserved. Our findings highlight the importance of the choice set preselection, which could be related to the role of general practitioners in the referral process and substantiate several barriers to patient choice."

"In this thesis, I investigate the implications of financial stress for economic fluctuations along several dimensions. What is it that makes financial crisis so disruptive? What is the role of the banking system in their propagation? How to identify and forecast financial distress? Each chapter brings new elements to complement the literature on these broad questions. In the first chapter of this thesis, written together with Yvan Bécard, we estimate a general equilibrium model where banks can adjust their lending standards for households and firms depending on their ability to liquidate the collateral of their borrowers. We find that collateral shocks, shocks that modify the liquidity of banks’ collateral, explain most of the US business cycle fluctuations for investment, consumption, loan volumes, and the credit spreads. In addition, the collateral shocks resemble measures of bank lending standard as observed over the past 30 years for households and firms. In the second chapter, I develop a model where the banking system is characterized by monopolistic competition and used to study the role of bank competition in the propagation of financial crises. I find that low competition in the banking system can dampen the impact of financial stress in situations where monetary policy is impeded by the ZLB. In the last chapter, I study the evolution of firm debt choices in response to different types of aggregate shocks. I find that only financial shocks imply opposite movements in bond and loan volumes. I use this result with sign-restriction methods to identify financial shocks in a VAR model. I find that financial shocks identified with bond and loan series explain a large share of the business cycle and especially the two last recessions. I also use the identification strategy to recover a measure of financial stress. This measure allows predicting the evolution of corporate bond spreads."
"This PhD thesis examines the dollarization process in Ecuador, i. E. The competition of the national money - the sucre - with the US dollar, distinguishing the partial dollarization (1982-2000) and the full dollarization (2000-2004). Partial dollarization allowed agents to preserve the real value of his monetary assets (parts I and II), but at the same time, involved macroeconomics costs. The effects of these costs rendered Ecuador in a progressively uncontrollable financial crisis at the end of the 1990s (part III) and resulted in the adoption of a full dollarization system (part IV). In chapter 1, after having given a basic definition of partial dollarization, we characterize its specific attributes in this country (magnitude, forms, motives). In chapter 2, we specify the institutional factors of partial dollarization by displaying the importance of financial liberalization of 1992. In the second portion, we lead an econometric analysis of the determinants of partial dollarization through a money demand estimation (chapter 3) then a ratio estimation of partial dollarization (chapter 4). Chapters 5 and 6, of the third part, examine the consequences of partial dollarization, more specifically in regards to the balance sheet effect. We show that the partial dollarization is the origin of an endogenous dynamic in the financial crisis (the twin crises) at the end of the 1990s, leading to a renewed interpretation of the Mundell‘s impossible trinity. The financial crisis ended in January 2000, with the adoption of the full dollarization system of which the study is the focus of the forth portion. Chapter 7 examines the benefits of full dollarization, specifically regarding the reduction of inflation. Lastly, in chapter 8, we analyse the costs of this system through the study of the degree of symmetry of the shocks between Ecuador and the United States. "

"Planification de la production par co-décision et négociation au sein d'une entreprise virtuelle. Dans cette thèse, nous abordons un problème lié à l'évolution du tissu industriel qui s'organise en réseaux d'entreprises coordonnant leurs activités pour la fabrication d'un même produit fini. Après une étude bibliographique détaillée sur la modélisation, la coordination et la planification au sein des chaînes logistiques en général et sur l'entreprise virtuelle (EV) en particulier, nous axons notre travail de recherche sur la modélisation et la planification, collaborée et coordonnée, de la production d'une entreprise virtuelle. Notre travail consiste à proposer d'une part une architecture de l'entreprise virtuelle par niveau et, d'autre part, des modèles de planification qui permettent d'assurer un plan de production faisable et quasi optimal suivant l'architecture proposée. Ceci est réalisé d'abord en coordonnant les plannings des entreprises d'un même niveau, puis en coordonnant les plannings de chaque niveau avec ceux des niveau amont et aval. Planification de la production par co-décision et négociation au sein d'une entreprise virtuelle. Dans cette thèse, nous abordons un problème lié à l'évolution du tissu industriel qui s'organise en réseaux d'entreprises coordonnant leurs activités pour la fabrication d'un même produit fini.

Notre travail consiste à proposer d'une part une architecture de l'entreprise virtuelle par niveau et, d'autre part, des modèles de planification qui permettent d'assurer un plan de production faisable et quasi optimal suivant l'architecture proposée. Ceci est réalisé d'abord en coordonnant les plannings des entreprises d'un même niveau, puis en coordonnant les plannings de chaque niveau avec ceux des niveau amont et aval. Pour atteindre notre objectif, nous avons proposé un ensemble de définitions des données que nous avons utilisées et que nous jugeons nécessaires pour une modélisation quasi complète des processus de planification au sein de l'entreprise virtuelle. La définition des prévisions et des contrats avec l'extérieur permet de connaître l'environnement externe de I'EV. De même, les définitions des courbes cumulées, des contrats et des modèles de coût utilisés par les partenaires permettent de connaître l'environnement interne à l'EV ainsi que les objectifs retenus pour une entreprise virtuelle. Pour décrire un processus global de planification de I'EV d'une façon progressive, nous avons commencé par la description du fonctionnement d'un nœud de I'EV en spécifiant ses différents problèmes de planification et proposant des modèles d'optimisation pour la minimisation des coûts de production. Ensuite, nous avons étudié les problèmes de planification sur un niveau et nous avons décrit et modélisé la coordination entre les nœuds de même niveau. Enfin, nous pouvons décrire le processus itératif de planification globale de toute la chaîne de production. Afin de réussir la coordination au sein de l'entreprise virtuelle, nous avons utilisé la négociation et la médiation. La négociation permet aux partenaires d'élargir le champ des possibilités de planning. Tandis que la médiation permet, par une relaxation de contraintes, de résoudre les conflits en cas de non convergence des négociations. Pour la mise en place des modèles de planification interactifs et mettre en évidence l'aspect distribué et centralisé du modèle de planification proposé, nous avons utilisé l'approche multi-agents. Après une description des différents agents constituant notre architecture ainsi que leurs fonctionnalités, nous nous sommes focalisés sur la description des differents comportements des agents en fonction des sollicitations qu'ils subissent, les données et les messages assurant les communications entre agents.

"Many researches have focused on the person of the SME's owner-manager, but few research has been made upon VSME (less than 10 employees), whereas they form the greater part of the economic world. One of the major problems met by those VSME is the problem of debts. The basic idea of this research is that the values of the owner-manager, and his mental representations of bank, have an effect on the amount and the nature of debts. A two stage methodology has been used. First, a structural model has been achieved to etimate the causality. This model failed. Then a predictive clustering using a neural network has been developped, the optimization being controlled by a genetic algorithm. This procedure gave positive results. For each cluster of owner-manager, the link between values, mental representations and debts has been shown. "

"The socio-economic approach that we are proposing is opposed top that adopted by supporters of the theory of rational action. This approach leads us to denounce models which represent man as an actor free from all economic and social conditioning as unrealistic. We believe that the homo-oeconomicus model in which man is noting but a disembodied being reduced to a maximizer of utility p@laced under certain constraints, cannot explain real behaviour. In this dissertation, we reject disciplinary compartmentalization and have alsop attempted to go beyond the descriptive stage found in most studies on organizations. We have demonstrated the usefullness of combining pierre bourdieu's theory of the habitus and the field with the grid of organizations developed by the professors in the ""strategy and business policy"" department of the froupe hec. Such an approach, as shown in this study, does, in fact, enable us to go beyond the descriptive stage to arrive at a better understanding of how organizations operatethe group of associations studied is made up of sports clubs. In these non-profit organizations, the agents can be both consumers and members. The socioeconomic prspective which we have adopted lets us not only explain how these organizations operate as fields, but also lets us explain these ""consumer"" choices. "
"This research analyses the role of Private Equity firms in the formation of strategic alliances within the field of the French Private Equity market. We start to provide evidence of its importance from new survey information, before offering an explanation of the organizational phenomenon. The study addresses the questions of how and why Private Equity firms act as relational intermediaries to help their portfolio companies form alliances. Both questions are investigated in the light of the Private Equity firms’ contribution to the value creation process that comes with alliance formation. Answers are provided by means of three jointly used theoretical frameworks: (1) mainstream theories (transaction cost theory and the positive theory of agency); (2) the knowledge based view; and 3) social network theories to complement the resulting from jointly use of the previous two theories. The theoretical construct is then tested empirically by means of a multi-method study with explanatory design, based on the pattern of joint evidence from both statistical tests and a multiple case study. Results show that French Private Equity firms do play a role in alliance formation. This role can be intentional as well as non-intentional. Furthermore, although arguments from the knowledge-based perspective finds more support in explaining this behavior than from the mainstream theories, our study highlights the benefits of the joint use of these theories and the complementary nature of them to better explaining the phenomenon as a whole."
"Life long learning appears as a major concern for our societies. After leaving the educational system, learning can imply returning to school or continuing education. Academic careers in France seem less and less linear. Young peopleare encouraged to make the most of college breaks in order to diversify their experiences. During their career, they are to be trained to « be free to choose their professional future », as mentions a new law. This thesis, then, aims atidentifying the reasons why people go back to training and at stuying how such returns are seen by the labor market.This work includes a preliminary chapter and three other chapters, each with specific data. Based on a literature review, the preliminary chapter investigates the reasons why people go back to school or choose training. We analyze the theoretical conditions explaining the way such experiences are seen by the labor market. The data of the first chapter are from the Céreq “Génération 98” survey, which tracks formal education leavers during tenyears. Such a longitudinal survey enables the study of the impact of non-linear pathways on recent graduates salaries, thanks to the instrumental variables method. Recent graduates with post-secondary education interruption receive alower salary than their peers, ceteris paribus – even with high social and academic profile and good relational skills. This seems to confirm the hypothesis of a negative signal to the employers.The results of the first chapter lead us into the second part where we investigate the promotion of atypical academic careers by the labor market. We surveyed recruitment consultants with the factorial survey method in order to understand how they perceive such careers. More than a thousand CVs were evaluated by the consultants according to the probability of them giving a job interview. Our econometric analysis shows that the absence of details about temporary education interruption seem detrimental, ceteris paribus. Facing the lack of information, recruitment consultants would not take the risk of hiring a candidate who has been non-working. Although, this large signal effect does not apply if the candidate mentions a trip abroad or a “service civique” during the academic career.In the third part we try to understand what determines a reinvestment in training – but only for working employees. We use the “Defis” survey lead by the Céreq. The data are from employees and companies questionnaires. Our results show that very few variables seem to impact the chance for an employee to seek training. Likewise, accessing to optional training seems to rely on individual motives and on job characteristics – even though company features do matter. This fact increases the inequality in training accessibility. Using a DID matching method shows that this type of training doesn’t seem to increase salaries."
"This research aims to focus the attention on the concept of ""legitimation lie"" in order to break the silence surrounding it and to shed light on an organizational phenomenon that is not as rare as what we could believe. Specifically, it provides an explanation of how some entrepreneurs succeed in acquiring initial legitimacy for their small and new businesses through lies. The study of the antithetical association of legitimacy and lies led us to focus on two research axes: on the one hand, the ethical considerations attributed to legitimacy lies and on the other hand, the process of their realization.On the theoretical level, our study required a reassessment of classical moral approaches, with the aim to offer a new alternative that goes beyond the operational limits encountered. In addition, the multi-dimensionality of lying process has been illustrated by the intersection of several disciplinary fields examining cognition, social exchanges and emotions.On the methodological level, this work was based on in-depth interviews conducted with 20 entrepreneurs of newly founded small businesses. The examination of the collected data was mainly based on thematic content analyzes preceded or completed, when necessary, by content analyzes or by practices appropriate to visual maps.The results suggest a process of legitimation through lies made of five phases: (1) a phase of identification of problems related to the organizational legitimacy in which the solutions usually practiced used are inaccessible. (2) A phase of construction of the lying’s tactic in which the entrepreneur identifies his / her collaborates, the victims and determines the form and content of the lie. During this phase, negative moral emotions, such as anxiety and guilt, are likely to emerge. These emotions reflect by their natures the ethical value associated to the lie. (3) A decision-making phase in which the entrepreneur, pushed by his ambitions and other environmental factors, rationalizes his behavior and neutralizes the negative emotions felt. (4) A phase of realization of the lying’s tactic and (5) a phase of control.The examination of the ethical considerations of lies revealed a ""free individual moral space"" - representing a margin between social and professional ethical standards, individual ethical norms and the circumstances surrounding the lies, where entrepreneurs allow themselves the right to use some forms of lie, according to their own rationality operating in that margin, without perceiving themselves as overstepping ethical limits."
"This thesis rises in a context where the automobile supremacy is questioned. It aims at analysing behavioural changes related to the deployment of solutions to pool car, in order to foresee evolution of its modes of use, intensity of use, as well as that of motorization. First, we identify new car mobility services as main vectors of changes in behaviours, we also measure the potential development of carpooling (important), carsharing and short-term car rental (limited), and we end up by showing that these services can achieve energy savings if used as substitute to individual equipment. In a second step, we focus on the analysis of mobility patterns from which we establish a behaviour classification highlighting their main drivers. From these, the estimation of a modal choice model shows that shifts from personal car toward public transport or shared car are likely to 2020, in the case of a decrease in households' motorization level. Thus, we finally analyse the evolution of households' motorization and emphasis a breaking point in the positive generational trends observed in the past, that will know a stagnation if not an inversion to 2020. As a consequence, the evolution of the French car market will tend to be more driven by sales to fleet and business than sales to private."
