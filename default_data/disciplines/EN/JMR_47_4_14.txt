 et al. 2004).  a result, companies invest substantial resources on the research and development, manufacturing, and marketing of new products. , new product introductions have a high rate of failure ( and  1994), reinforcing the need for both academia and industry to better understand various factors that may facilitate or impede new product  boundaries between a company and its customers, the sales force plays a significant role in the success of new products. , research on the sales  role in the new product success has largely been neglected ( 1997).  that a typical new  success depends on the success of the sales force in selling the product, the lack of research in this area is surprising.  in the   spend more than $ trillion annually on their sales forces and accompanying support, more than four times the amount spent on advertising ( and  2005).  deployment of these substantial resources on behalf of a new product can be pivotal to that  success in the market.  such investment, several studies have pointed to  lack of commitment as a contributing factor to the low success rates of new products ( 1997;  et al. 1985).  lack of commitment to new products could be due to various reasons.  example, new products can be complex, and salespeople may not have the time or access to proper training to develop the necessary product knowledge ( 1998).  may even be unwilling to expend the energy necessary to sell a new product ( 1985;  and  2000), preferring instead to focus on selling established products because this requires less effort and engenders greater certainty than attempting to generate interest in a new product.  addition, the control system under which a salesperson works may influence this choice between investing resources in developing a market for a new product and pushing established products.  studies have suggested that firms often fail to adjust their control systems in a way that provides the appropriate incentives and rewards for their salespeople to sell new products, and researchers have called for additional empirical research on the role of both the salesperson and the control systems in the success of new product introductions ( 1997;  and  2000)., the purpose of this research is to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that provides insights into the process of how an organization can use sales force control systems to improve new product success. , we posit that a key factor for new product success is the extent to which salespeople believe in the usefulness and value of the product because this influences the effort they expend on the product.  suggests that salespeople are likely to place more effort on a product when they “believe in” the product.  use the new institutional economics perspective to argue that, on the contrary, positive salesperson product perceptions result in less effort expended on a new , we examine the critical moderating influence of sales force control systems on this relationship.  particular, we suggest that the  choice of control systems has a major impact on the direction and extent to which product beliefs translate into sales force behavior. , by using a  control system, a firm may be able to buffer the negative relationship between salesperson product beliefs and effort.  is, by exerting more control over its salespeople under a  control system, a firm can ensure that the salespeople exert efforts on the new product regardless of their perceptions of the , because the success of the new product is the  ultimate objective, we also examine a  role of customer product  which salesperson efforts translate into new product success, along with the influence of control systems on the relationship between salesperson effort and customer product perceptions.  literature on new product introductions has identified customer product perceptions as critical to the success of new products ( and  2001).  argue that  control systems reduce the effectiveness of a  efforts in shaping a  product perceptions, thereby adversely affecting the sales of the new  latter point is critical because a sales manager might be tempted, given the importance of new products, to micromanage his or her salespeople during product launch by using a  control system.  way, the sales manager can ensure that salespeople exert prescribed effort on the new product regardless of their perceptions of the product. , we suggest that this view would be shortsighted because such micromanagement reduces the effectiveness of the  efforts in shaping a  product perceptions.  of their closeness to the market and regular interaction with customers, salespeople are in a unique position to develop knowledge about specific selling situations and adapt their planning and behavior accordingly, a practice called “working smart” ( 1986).  behavioral controls constrain the  ability to channel effort in a direction that fully leverages such knowledge, we argue that sales managers are better off staying away from such micromanagement during a new product launch by using  control.  might have less control over their  allocation of effort on the new product, but this effort will be more successful in shaping customer perceptions.  are aware of no other study that has empirically examined this critical role of sales force control systems on the success of new , we contribute to the literature by using a unique longitudinal multisource data set that includes objective performance measures.  is a significant advancement over much of the existing new product sales literature, which has used   data, often with  performance  we believe that the hypotheses and findings (see  ) should generalize to multiple settings, we selected the pharmaceutical industry as the context for the research.  successful launch of new products is particularly important to pharmaceutical firms, which spend an average of $25 billion each year developing new products and introduce an average of 41 new products each year ( et al. 2005;  2005). , pharmaceutical companies are particularly reliant on sales representatives to persuade physicians to prescribe their products, both new and existing; in 2002, pharmaceutical companies employed more than 90000 sales representatives in the   and spent more than $ billion on their sales forces ( 2003).  persuasion stems from what is called “missionary”  term derived from likening the sales situation to that of a missionary “preaching the gospel.”  the original intention behind the term, we anticipate missionary sales to be a particularly salient context in which to test the model, which speaks to the importance of “belief” in a  product.  sales jobs are commonplace in  selling.  example, salespeople in the consumer packaged goods industry, financial services wholesalers, and industries in which manufacturers sell through merchants all engage in missionary     < .05:  obtained data from three difference sources at three different times:  indicate data collected from survey of salespeople,  circle indicates data collected from survey of physicians, and rectangles indicate data obtained from company records.   indicates data collected at time t = ,   indicates data collected at time t =  months, and   indicates data collected at time t = 12  in  and HypothesesThe  of   PerceptionBeliefs and behavior are often connected, and it is likely that a key factor influencing how much effort salespeople put into a new product (behavior) is their perceptions of the  superiority over existing competitors' products (belief).  this study, we define “salesperson product perception” as the extent to which the salesperson believes the new product is beneficial and desirable to both physicians and consumers relative to existing competitors' products.  form an impression about the value and marketing potential of a new product based on the information the firm provides and their own understanding of the market.  the  frequent need to allocate effort across a portfolio of products (, , and  1990), the perception of the new  relative value and market potential should affect how salespeople adapt their level of effort in selling this new product.  the impact of salesperson product perception on salesperson effort has been untested to date, intuition suggests that when salespeople believe in the value and market potential of a new product, they are likely to invest greater effort in fully exploiting the salability of the product. , if salespeople perceive the new product as having only limited market potential, they will invest less effort on this product and continue putting relatively more effort on  products in their , new institutional economics suggests an opposite effect:  salespeople believe that the new product offers substantial benefits over existing products, they may decide to expend relatively less effort on the product.  counterintuitive decision is driven by an opportunity to leverage the  marketing and sales  as advertising, the cultivation of opinion leaders, and sponsorship of continuing medical education  well as the positive effects of social contagion and word of mouth that potentially surround such a new product ( 1989;  den  and  2001).  is a greater likelihood of the physician becoming aware of a substantially better new product from these complementary external sources. , salespeople may believe that such a new product can “sell itself” with little effort on their part, and as a result, they may divert efforts to current products in the portfolio that have demonstrated success in the past.  enables the salespeople to improve their overall sales , if salespeople believe that the new product offers only marginal benefits over existing products, they may adapt accordingly and put forth greater effort to sell this product.  counterintuitive decision is driven by a relatively lower likelihood of the physician becoming aware of a marginally better new product from complementary external sources.  external sources may not sufficiently complement effort spent on a new product the salespeople believe to be less advantageous, they are likely to compensate by increasing their efforts.  with an intuitive  view, new institutional economics takes into account the group dynamics underlying  criteria of allocating effort to maximize overall performance (, , and  1992), thus capturing how salespeople adapt their effort levels to their product perceptions in real  that the psychological literature on human motivation further supports this view ( 1980).  literature suggests that as the difficulty of a task increases from very easy to moderately difficult, the amount of effort a person is likely to put in increases as well.  selling a substantially better product is believed to be an easy task, salespeople tend to invest a small amount of effort on the product. , selling a marginally better product is perceived as a relatively more difficult task, and as a result, salespeople are motivated to put in a relatively greater amount of effort. H1:   new product perception negatively influences the amount of effort demonstrated on the focal   of    SystemsIn an effort to increase sales force productivity and align salesperson behavior with organizational priorities, firms typically have formal control systems in place. , a control system is “an  set of procedures for monitoring, directing, evaluating, and compensating its employees” ( and  1987, p. 76).  force control systems can be outcome based, behavior based, or some point along a continuum between the two.  control systems hold salespeople accountable for tangible results, with relatively little management direction or monitoring of the methods used to achieve the results.  contrast,  control systems are characterized by high levels of direction and close monitoring of activities that management considers important in achieving desired tangible and intangible results.  firms use a combination of  and  control systems.  within a single firm, managers may employ varying degrees of outcome- and  control systems according to their own management styles and preferences, their assessment of the context, and the responsiveness of particular  salesperson performance is assessed and rewarded differently under the two control systems, resultant salesperson behavior differs as well.  difference in salesperson behavior is likely to extend to a  approach to selling a new product.  product introductions are usually uncertain:  no history to gauge market potential, there is an element of risk to the salesperson in investing resources in a new product. , new products are both time and service intensive, involving much more preparation, communication, and  than selling an existing proven product. , salespeople, primarily driven by risk aversion ( 1989), may be reluctant to invest resources in new   control systems,  compensation usually depends on their overall sales ( and  1987). , the  objective is to allocate efforts in a way that maximizes overall sales.  effort placed on the new product correspondingly reduces effort on current products, salespeople are likely to consider the potential of the new product before deciding on the amount of resources to invest in it.  is particularly true in a pharmaceutical setting, in which the salesperson usually has limited time with the physician on any given sales call.  a salesperson believes that the new product offers substantial benefits over existing competitors, he or she may decide to exert relatively less effort on this product.  decision is driven by the opportunity to leverage complementary external sources:  the salesperson believes that such a product will “sell itself” with little effort, he or she is prone to divert efforts to other products in the portfolio to maximize overall sales.  salesperson is likely to behave this way even if the firm provides specific incentives for the new product, such as rewards for achieving new product sales targets. , if the salesperson believes that the new product offers only marginal benefits, he or she may exert relatively more effort on this product.  such a product, there is less opportunity for the salesperson to leverage complementary external sources, and the salesperson is less confident that the product will succeed without effort. , the salesperson is likely to compensate by increasing effort on the  a  control system, the  compensation and career progression largely depend on following the directions of the firm ( and  1987).  structure creates incentives for the salespeople to follow a  directives and reduces the inherent risk they face from environmental uncertainty. , because their actions are under greater scrutiny, they have less opportunity to adapt their behavior to their perceptions even if they recognize the need. , salespeople are motivated to allocate effort on various products in their portfolio in line with the  directives.  that a firm is typically interested in pushing its new products, a salesperson is likely to exert a larger proportion of effort on the new product in accordance with the  directives.  example, in the pharmaceutical industry, a salesperson under a  control system is likely to receive specific objectives from the firm, such as the number of sales calls to make on behalf of the new product, the amount of samples to distribute, and the kinds of promotional material to provide to the physicians. H2:   control system reduces the negative relationship between the  new product perception of and effort on the focal product, whereas an  control system enhances the negative   of  ExperienceDo all salespeople respond similarly to a control system, or do they differ?  research has explored the role of experience in  motivation, job attitudes, and work perceptions ( and  1986), as well as in various work behaviors and performance.  other things, research has shown that early in their careers, salespeople have inadequate job knowledge and only a vague idea about the skills and abilities required to perform effectively.  salespeople evolve and gain experience, their expanded knowledge base helps clarify the requirements for effective performance.  of its strong relevance and high predictive value, several recent studies have also examined the role of experience as a moderator of relationships between various constructs (.,  et al. 2006). propose that experience is likely to influence the effect of control systems on a  adaptive behavior.  experienced salesperson has developed more elaborate knowledge of the selling environment and is more likely to have witnessed that while substantially better products sell on their own, products that are only marginally better than the competition require more effort.  addition, more experienced salespeople better understand the boundaries of job rewards, enabling them to more confidently make  judgments and adapt their selling and support activities accordingly. , the adaptive response of experienced salespeople under an  control system will be more pronounced because they are more likely than less experienced salespeople to adapt to or act on their beliefs.  experienced salespeople are less likely to deviate from the implied managerial direction that may exist during the new product launch.  we discussed previously, experienced salespeople have the freedom and motivation to adapt their effort level only under an  control system; they are constrained under a  control system. H3:  duration of salesperson experience exacerbates the negative effect of  control systems on the relationship between a  product perception of and effort on the   of   PerceptionResearch in  employee relationships suggests a link between a  advocacy of a product and the resulting customer perception (, , and  1985).  expending more effort on a new product, a salesperson is more likely to provide the customer with current, relevant, and useful information.  high level of effort also conveys to the customer the value of the product and the  confidence in the product. , customers are likely to have more positive product perceptions when salespeople put forth higher levels of effort on the  pharmaceutical salespeople provide information on new developments and the results of latest clinical studies, physicians consider them an important source of current medical information.  other means that pharmaceutical salespeople use to push new products include providing free samples and invitations to sponsored seminars and conferences.  all these activities help physicians assess the relevance and usefulness of the product (, , and  2001), the level of effort the salespeople put into a new product helps shape the  perception of the product ( and  1989). H4:   effort on a new product positively influences the  perception of that , we believe that the  choice of control systems will play an important role in this relationship.   control systems, salespeople have the flexibility to adapt their effort allocation across products ( and  1987;  1989).  tends to be no formal directive from the firm to place relatively more effort on one product over another. , such salespeople are likely to consider the return on their efforts on each product to arrive at an allocation of efforts over various products in the portfolio.  we proposed previously, salespeople under  control systems invest less effort in a substantially better product that they believe can sell on its own.  primarily rely on other external sources to complement their minimal efforts in shaping a favorable customer perception of the product and channel their effort in a way that maximizes overall performance across the portfolio of products for which they are responsible. , salespeople expend relatively more effort on a product they believe to be only marginally better than competitors. , under an  control system, salespeople are more adaptive, making use of the contextual intelligence gained in their customer contact role, and calibrate efforts to the new  potential and customer requirements.  implies that a  efforts on a new product are more likely to improve customer product perceptions  a  control system, however, salespeople have the incentive to follow the  directives in allocating their efforts over various products in the portfolio ( and  1987;  1989).  that a firm pushes its new product with maximal effort, a risk is that salespeople under a  control system will overdo their efforts on the new product in one of two ways. , because they are being evaluated on activities rather than on end results, these salespeople lack the motivation and flexibility to adapt the allocation of their personal resources to fully leverage their market knowledge.  a result, they may make suboptimal decisions on which clients to call on because they have incentives to meet particular behavioral requirements, (., a predetermined number of calls on particular physicians pertaining to the new product launch). , these salespeople may make suboptimal decisions regarding what they focus on during the sales call.  example, they are likely to push the focal product in accordance with the  directives even if they are aware that it would be more meaningful to focus on other products in the portfolio.  salespeople do so because their compensation depends on following the  directives and not necessarily their sales performance.  a result of either or both scenarios, such effort by a salesperson on behalf of the new product is not likely to yield commensurate positive returns.  have a unique opportunity to pick up on subtle environmental and customer cues, enabling them to develop “street smarts” that can be used to both their and the  advantage in targeting, planning, and executing sales calls ( 1999).  well intended,  control systems force the salesperson into a prescribed set of activities that inhibit him or her from leveraging this knowledge.  summary, under a  control system, the salesperson is less likely to be able to adapt effort to meet specific customer requirements, and as a result, we would expect a weaker relationship between salesperson effort and customer product perceptions. , this more extensive dampening effect of  control systems on the relationship between salesperson effort and customer product perceptions creates a dilemma for the firms:  can elicit strong sales force effort on the new product through  control systems but at the cost of inhibiting the effectiveness of this effort in enhancing customer product perception. , we predict the H5:   control system reduces the positive relationship between a  effort on a new product and the  product perception, whereas an  control system enhances the positive  knowledge about a product enables a physician to develop more confidence in the product and increases his or her overall product perception.  has shown a positive relationship between product perceptions and favorable outcomes, such as purchase intentions ( and  1992). , a physician with a higher product perception is likely to prescribe the product more, which will lead to higher sales. H6:   perception of the new product positively influences its  and MethodSample and ProcedureThe sample was drawn in a longitudinal manner from the female health care division of a midsized pharmaceutical company.  sales representative was responsible for the sales of five products, including the new product.  collected data from three separate sources over three periods. , salesperson product perceptions, experience, and perceptions of the control system were collected after the launch of the new product.  salespeople attended product training and rollout meetings for the new product before the launch.  months after the launch, we obtained salesperson effort (call activity for six months) from company records. , we obtained product perceptions from customers (physicians) in each  territory six months after launch. , we obtained each  sales of the new product (percent to quota) from company records for the  period following the new product  representative  surveyed 254 sales representatives of the female health care division and obtained 226 usable survey responses (88%).  60% of the sample were women and had an average tenure with this organization of  years (SD = ).  representatives sold individually and marketed directly to   mailed a survey to 3000 physicians offering a $30 honorarium with a letter stating that the research was completely confidential and was being conducted by a major . research university.  eliminate any potential biases toward the focal firm, the survey was balanced such that all ratings on the survey related to any specific company or product were collected for all major competitors.  % of questionnaires were returned because of incorrect addresses, and 428 (∼15%) usable questionnaires were received.  conducted tests to rule out nonresponse bias by comparing early and late responders, as well as nonresponders and responders using secondary data MeasuresThe development of salesperson and customer product perception measures began with a review of the relevant literature and an exploratory qualitative grounding.  conducted ten  interviews with sales representatives and ten  interviews with physicians who were customers of these sales representatives.  constructed a draft questionnaire and pretested it with six company managers and representatives and two industry experts.  employed standard procedures to adapt and validate both the reflective and formative scales ( and  2001).  the pretests, we made minor wording adjustments to ensure  assessed “salesperson product perceptions” with a  formative scale that included the main attributes considered when evaluating a brand in the focal product category (., “ rate product  on the following , ease of use, patients' willingness to accept, and  to other products in the category”).  were on a  scale anchored by “poor” and “excellent.” assessed “customer product perceptions” using a  formative scale that included items identical to those on the salesperson survey.  scale mirrored the scale used to measure salesperson product  measured “control systems perception of the salespeople” using the scale that  and  (1994) developed.  scale consisted of 21 separate items representing five unique dimensions of the perceptions of a  control system.   and  procedure, we converted all subscales to  and additively combined them to form an index of control system in which an  control system is represented by a lower score on the index.“” was a composite measure consisting of three separate measures of sales experience, including time in sales territory, time with the company, and time in the sales profession.   these scores and averaged them to form an overall experience  assessed “effort” as the total number of sales calls made to physicians within a  territory for the new product in the postlaunch  period.   the number of sales  tracked by the  customer relationship management (CRM) system (). , these sales calls are validated by the  and   because it is necessary that physicians “sign off” every time a sales representatives drops off product samples.  use actual sales calls reported rather than sample drops because the measure is more inclusive of all sales interactions with  obtained “new product sales performance” from company records.  a measure, we used the “percentage of sales quota” achieved by each salesperson on the product of interest in the female health care division for the postlaunch  period.  company sets quotas on the basis of the predictors of territory potential (., number of physicians, territory size). and EstimationTo test the proposed model and enable the modeling of both formative and reflective constructs, we adopted a partial least squares (PLS) approach.  other structural equation modeling approaches, PLS does not provide specific measures of fit per se (., comparative fit index, root mean square error of approximation).  assess relative fit, we examined interitem correlations that demonstrate that individual items are more strongly related to items from the same latent construct, as opposed to other items.  also examined latent construct correlations

that a  control system overcomes the negative effect of salesperson product perceptions on the amount of effort demonstrated (H2;  = .19, p < .05). , we also found that a  control system hindered the

nonhypothesized relationships, we estimated a fourth and final model.  model included all the linear relationships not previously tested on the two remaining endogenous  product perceptions and new

previously, the results of the study show that customer product perception is a facilitating mechanism for the effect of a  level of effort on the sales of a new product ( = .21, p < .01).  including the direct influence of salesperson effort on performance, we found that the level of effort demonstrated has a significant direct influence on performance ( = .19, p < .01) and that the relationship between customer product perceptions and performance remains significant ( = .17, p < .05). , the relationship between effort and new product sales is only partially mediated by customer new product perceptions.  addition, we uncovered a direct relationship between salesperson product perceptions and new product sales ( = .17, p < .05), indicating that there may be other mediating mechanisms that facilitate the transfer of positive salesperson product perceptions to new product DiscussionThe purpose of this research was to develop and empirically test a conceptual model that provides insights into the process of how an organization can successfully leverage its sales force in selling new products.  the paradigm shift from transactional marketing to relationship marketing,  than  moved to the forefront of marketing attention.  firms devote considerable attention to building sustainable competitive advantages by developing and maintaining close customer relationships and by investing extensive time and money in understanding what influences their customers ( et al. 1997).  customers' product perceptions, both in  and  settings, have been the subject of considerable research, we believe that the importance of the perceptions held by another important   sales  been neglected.  how critical new products can be to a  ongoing vitality and the pivotal role of the sales force in their commercialization, nowhere is this more important than in the context of a new product launch.  study suggests that when firms introduce a new product, factors beyond the product and customer must be , the type of control system used to manage the sales force and the salesperson perceptions of the new product, because both influence the extent to which and the way information pertaining to the product is conveyed to the customer, along with the ultimate impressions formed by the  longitudinal survey data from a sample of 226 salespeople in the pharmaceutical field, along with external ratings from customers and objective measures of effort and performance, we tested the effect of salesperson product perceptions on salesperson effort, along with the resultant impact on customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales, while examining the moderating effects of  control systems and salesperson experience.  the process, we uncovered three key findings that have important implications for both researchers and , contrary to conventional wisdom (but supported by new institutional economic theory and the literature on human motivation), positive salesperson product perceptions actually work to the detriment of the new product, in that the more the salesperson believes the new product is superior to existing competitors, the less effort he or she is likely to expend selling the new product.  the salesperson believes that the new product will “sell itself,” he or she will be prone to rely on external sales, marketing support, and word of mouth generated by the new product and instead attempt to improve his or her overall sales performance by diverting efforts to other products in the , the results show that control systems play a pivotal role in influencing the relationship between  perceptions of the new product and the amount of effort they expend in selling the product.   control system makes the relationship even more negative.  this system, salespeople have greater discretion regarding the specific activities they perform in the marketplace and thus are afforded more flexibility to adapt their effort allocation across all the products in their portfolio.  strategic  of most salespeople is that their overall performance within the territory is derived from the sales of all products.  faced with a potentially unlimited amount of  a scarcity of resources with which to accomplish this  under  control systems will make choices about how to allocate their limited resources by comparing the marginal utility of the effort spent on each customer.  this drive to allocate resources efficiently, a salesperson with high new product perceptions will be more likely to trust the new product to sell on its own merits and thus will focus on other products to maximize overall performance.  the control system becomes more behavior based, however, the negative relationship between the  product perception and the accompanying effort on the new product will be attenuated.  reason for this could be the decreased flexibility and motivation on the part of the salespeople to adapt their effort , the negative relationship between product perceptions and salesperson effort is exacerbated by experience.  hypothesized a  interaction among salesperson experience, control system, and salesperson effort because we believe that experienced salespeople are likely to be more adaptive under an  control system. , the results suggest that, in general, experienced salespeople are able to be more adaptive than newer  kind of control system does not seem to make a difference.  salespeople ostensibly are able to draw on their knowledge and experience to ascertain the market potential of a new product and its ability to succeed without a corresponding increase in effort. , along with perhaps a stronger inclination and ability to adapt, biases the experienced salesperson in the direction of allocating effort away from the highly perceived new product and toward other products in the portfolio to maximize overall performance. , the newer salesperson lacks the experience with which to form these effort allocation judgments and, as a result, tends to expend effort in a manner more consistent with product beliefs.  that the relationship is specifically about adaptation of effort allocation across various products; in no way does it imply reduction or increase in the total amount of , although the moderating effect of control systems on the salesperson  effort relationship seems to imply that a company may be better off using  control systems to launch new  ones that may be radically new or markedly superior to existing  results demonstrate that this course of action may be shortsighted.  systems also influence the relationship between salesperson effort and customer product perceptions. ,  controls result in a less successful shift in physician product beliefs, adversely affecting new product sales  show that the effort a salesperson puts into a new product influences the  perception of the new product and that these customer perceptions directly affect new product sales.  addition to providing current product information that enables the customer to form an informed opinion about the  relevant features and benefits, the effort the salesperson puts forth conveys his or her confidence in the  value.  the pharmaceutical context of this study, customers (physicians) rely heavily on salespeople for product information.  increased product knowledge that results from a  call activity enables a physician to develop more confidence in the new product and form a more favorable perception of the  potential value to patients.  turn, this leads to a larger number of prescriptions by physicians and, thus, stronger new product  an  control system, salespeople have the flexibility to allocate effort across all the products in their portfolio in whatever way they believe is optimal. , salespeople are more adaptive, calibrating their efforts to the new  potential and customers' requirements.  reduces the risk of misallocating efforts on the new product, which in turn ensures a positive relationship between their effort and corresponding customer perceptions of the product.  a  control system, salespeople are less  is, they are less able and willing to calibrate their efforts to meet specific customer requirements. , they are more likely to follow the  directives pertaining to new  activities ( and  1987;  1989).  that sales managers themselves often were experienced salespeople, ideally they would be expected to devise an optimal control system based on their knowledge of the relationship between a  activities and customer perceptions of the new product. , they would be expected to issue directives to their salespeople such that the allocation of effort on the new product optimally affects customer perceptions. , either because of their new role as product advocates or because they lack the richness of information that salespeople have about the nuances of their territory and customer base, sales managers who use behavioral control systems may end up misguiding their salespeople in the deployment of effort on the new product.  sales managers were omniscient, they would impose the optimal behavioral control system, but to the extent that their knowledge is imperfect, their behavioral prescriptions will systematically misdirect sales personnel. , salespeople following the dictates of  control systems run the risk of misallocating their efforts on the new product with some customers.  effort on a new product implies not only reduced effort on other products but also less time spent planning, thus potentially constraining both the quality of targeting and the quality of the sales call.  making unneeded  misdirected calls, salesperson efforts on behalf of the new product do not yield commensurate positive returns, leading to a weaker relationship between salesperson effort and customer product , this dampening effect of  control systems on customer product perceptions in conjunction with its encouraging effect on salesperson effort creates an intriguing dilemma for the firm in that managers may succumb to the temptation of using a  control system to elicit strong sales force effort on the new product, but at the cost of sacrificing the effectiveness of this effort in enhancing customer product perceptions.  research suggests that a more enlightened approach is to use an  control system to let salespeople adapt the level of effort on the new product, which may ultimately be more effective in enhancing customer product perceptions.  a sense, even when following their , salespeople under an  control system help the  cause.  juxtaposed, the two kinds of control systems reflect different cultures:   control system seems to make people work smarter, while a  control system seems to make people work harder ( 1986; , , and  1988). , our findings go against  (1979, p. ) proposition that if the company can both measure outcomes and understand the  transformation process, “either form of control system and conceivably both are feasible and neither is a priori preferable.”  demonstrate empirically that even when both conditions hold, the form of control system used can have important consequences on the success of the new  ImplicationsTraditionally, pharmaceutical companies have employed the use of sales representatives as a valuable marketing tool to persuade physicians to prescribe the  specific products.  1998, approximately 65% of total spending was on  selling by approximately 57500 sales representatives ( 1999).  of the number of pharmaceutical sales representatives in the   alone exceeded 90000 in 2003, having more than doubled from 1995 ( 2003).  these figures are specific to one organizational setting, the data are parallel to the growth of sales representatives across multiple industries.  is well known that salespeople are the primary source of product information and  spending in the vast majority of  settings.  growth in the sales force is an indication of the increasing emphasis on relationship marketing across many industries, and this shift underscores the importance of gaining an understanding of how sales representatives' product perceptions influence customer product perceptions.  successful new product introductions are a key component of ongoing marketing strategy for a multitude of industries, including pharmaceuticals, this is especially relevant in the case of a new product.  that the sales role in the pharmaceutical industry is similar to that in other  settings, such as consumer packaged goods sales, financial service wholesalers, or other industries that sell through merchants, we expect that these finding will hold true in other  findings have important implications for managers who oversee sales representatives and for those who coordinate new product launches.  is evident that managers must be cognizant of the interacting role of product perceptions and control systems in influencing salesperson effort on new products and their ultimate success in the market.  that positive product perceptions may actually reduce salesperson effort on a new product, the firm should be careful in its internal marketing practices not to oversell the product to the sales force, particularly to more experienced salespeople. , this is easier said than done because, without question, the sales force must be provided with sufficient information about the product to represent it effectively to potential customers.  this point, it might be appropriate for managers to emphasize to the sales force the challenges and potential obstacles that exist in the marketplace so as to inhibit the development of overconfidence in the new product and the potential corresponding belief that the product can sell itself with little salesperson effort.  may help ensure that the sales representatives effectively communicate information about the product offering no matter what their perceptions are of the  is readily apparent that desired outcomes are contingent on salespeople engaging in and demonstrating effort in their tasks.  the results show that  control systems can mitigate the negative relationship of product perceptions on salesperson effort, the firm might be tempted to simply put into place a  control system that monitors and rewards the execution of activities supporting the new product (., specific call requirements).  of their importance to the firm, new product initiatives can invite considerable postlaunch scrutiny, adding to the appeal of this option. , the CRM literature points to an increasing reliance on CRM systems to target marketing resources toward specific customers and to direct employee behavior accordingly ( and  2005).  personal selling dominates marketing communications in a  context ( and  2005), managers may be prone to take information gleaned from such CRM systems to mandate specific call plans and selling behavior for their sales personnel.  current research indicates that such as strategy might be a mistake.  same  control systems that elicit stronger effort on the new product can actually diminish the effectiveness of that effort in positively influencing customer product perceptions (thus hurting new product sales performance) by inhibiting the  ability  willingness to use his or her closeness to the market to the  advantage in allocating effort across the portfolio of products and customers.  a limited number of calls that can be made in a day, when a salesperson has multiple products to sell, he or she must make resource allocation decisions with respect to the amount and type of attention that should optimally be placed on each product within the portfolio with each  that the salesperson arguably is in the best position to make.  controlling the  actions, managers fail to adequately recognize the  time constraints and market knowledge, restrict the  opportunity to engage in adaptive selling (, , and  1988), and potentially direct the salesperson to misallocate  of which serve to reduce the  effectiveness in shaping customer product perceptions. , managers are  to turn to a  control system to force salespeople to hit activity targets.  CRM systems may capture valuable information that both management and sales personnel can use effectively, but  the sales force through  mandates of which customers to call, how often and when to call on them, and what to say to them is likely to yield suboptimal results in the case of a new product launch.  of the contextual intelligence, or “street smarts,” that exists within the sales force does not reside within an internal database, and salespeople require the flexibility to act on this knowledge.  sales managers may construe to be shirking on the part of their salespeople may actually be adaptive behavior that optimizes   markets, the sales force is a major product- and  tool,  trained on and leveraged  create a significant competitive advantage.  the context of a new product introduction, the results of this study suggest that managers must () carefully administer the internal flow of information about the new product such that sales personnel are well versed in its relevant features and benefits without becoming overconfident in its ability to “sell itself” to customers and () resist the temptation to employ a ,  approach of control and instead provide appropriate flexibility to salespeople in managing their call activity through more  control systems.  will maximize the chance that customers form positive perceptions of the new product, leading to greater sales and a more successful new product  and  ResearchThis study provides key insights into the influence of sales force control systems on new product success by affecting salesperson effort level and customer product perceptions. , as with all research, the empirical study has some limitations that restrict its generalizability but open up worthwhile areas for further , for the sake of parsimony and understanding, we constrained our conceptual framework to only key constructs of theoretical importance.  implies that there could be other mediating and moderating variables, such as the role of adaptive selling or customer orientation, that would be of interest for researchers and could enhance the richness of our findings. , although we make an effort to take into account the causal order of events in the model by using  data, it is possible that alternative causal sequences exist.  research that examines these and other relationships in different stages of the sales encounter would be beneficial.  example, the salesperson product perceptions data are temporally static in nature because they were collected at the introduction of the new product.  research could be conducted that measures both customer and salesperson product perceptions at multiple periods following the product launch. , this study has a  perspective of new product success (., sales performance six months after the launch).  might be worthwhile to take a  perspective; although there is no reason to believe so, a sustained  salesperson effort under  control might have a different effect on sales performance. , this research demonstrates that, overall, a marginal unit of effort expended on a new product under a  control is less efficient than that expended according to the  discretion.  suggest that for a salesperson optimizing his or her limited number of sales calls each day over multiple products, returns from a marginal unit of effort spent on another product could dominate the returns from the focal product.  might consider measuring salesperson product perception of, salesperson effort on, and performance of each individual product in a  portfolio.  using data from the full portfolio of products would further support the findings. , given that the fundamentals of both selling and sales management in a pharmaceutical sales environment are not dramatically different from those in other sales settings, particularly those in other missionary or  contexts, we believe that the results should generalize to other settings. , it would be beneficial to reexamine this model under other sales settings. , literature on human motivation suggests an inverted  relationship between task difficulty and the level of effort.  the salesperson perceptions in this study are between the easy to moderate  range, we could not validate the suggested relationship over the entire curve.  research into salesperson perceptions over the entire range of task difficulty could help validate the curvilinear  findings pave the way for additional research that might uncover important moderating influences on the tested relationships that further inform both theory and practice.  example, when considering a  level of experience and control systems, two research questions are applicable. , does more experience act as a substitute for leadership, and do more experienced salespeople act independently of their control system, relying on past experiences and relationships to influence customer perceptions and performance? , do more experienced salespeople demonstrate significantly different perceptions of a new product than less experienced salespeople, ultimately changing their behaviors and information communicated?  area of interest refers to the product portfolio of the salesperson.  the current setting, the portfolio remained constant across all salespeople. , in some settings, these portfolios vary.  such circumstances, examining issues such as difficulty of selling, sales cycle, and perceived value of products within the portfolio would be valuable. , although we demonstrate that an  control system is more likely to lead to more favorable customer perceptions of a new product than a  control system, researchers might want to study a scenario in which sales managers clearly have greater insight than salespeople.  such a scenario, the advantage of the  control system over a  control system might go away or even be reversed.  would enable researchers to develop useful distinctions between appropriate control and ReferencesAnderson  (1985), “  as an   or :    ,”  , ), 23454 to ReferenceCrossrefGoogle ScholarAnderson , and   .
